description: 'Detect procdump.exe dumping the lsass process. This query looks for
  both -mm and -ma usage. -mm will produce a mini dump file and -ma will write a dump
  file with all process memory. Both are highly suspect and should be reviewed. This
  query does not monitor for the internal name (original_file_name=procdump) of the
  PE or look for procdump64.exe. Modify the query as needed.

  During triage, confirm this is procdump.exe executing. If it is the first time a
  Sysinternals utility has been ran, it is possible there will be a -accepteula on
  the command line. Review other endpoint data sources for cross process (injection)
  into lsass.exe.'

  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: None identified.
