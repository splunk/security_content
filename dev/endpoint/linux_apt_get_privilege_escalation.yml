description: The apt-get is a command line tool for interacting with the Advanced
  Package Tool (APT) library (a package management system for Linux distributions).
  It allows you to search for, install, manage, update, and remove software. The tool
  does not build software from the source code. If sudo right is given to the tool
  for user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly get a root
  shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*apt-get*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
