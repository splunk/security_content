description: The following analytic identifies the process java writing a .jsp to
  disk. This is potentially indicative of a web shell being written to disk. Modify
  and tune the analytic based on data ingested. For instance, it may be worth running
  a broad query for jsp file writes first before performing a join.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Image|endswith:
    - java
    - java.exe
    - javaw.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem`
  node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the
  latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible and filtering may be required.
  Restrict by assets or filter known jsp files that are common for the environment.
