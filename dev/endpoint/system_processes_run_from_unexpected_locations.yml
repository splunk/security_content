description: 'This search looks for system processes that typically execute from `C:\Windows\System32\`
  or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`.  This may indicate a malicious process that is trying
  to hide as a legitimate process.

  This detection utilizes a lookup that is deduped `system32` and `syswow64` directories
  from Server 2016 and Windows 10.

  During triage, review the parallel processes - what process moved the native Windows
  binary? identify any artifacts on disk and review. If a remote destination is contacted,
  what is the reputation?'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Processes.process_path: C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64*
  selection2:
    Processes.process_path: C:\\Windows\\System32*
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: This detection may require tuning based on third party applications
  utilizing native Windows binaries in non-standard paths.
