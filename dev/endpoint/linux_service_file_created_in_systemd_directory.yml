description: This analytic looks for suspicious file creation in systemd timer directory
  in linux platform. systemd is a system and service manager for Linux distributions.
  From the Windows perspective, this process fulfills the duties of wininit.exe and
  services.exe combined. At the risk of simplifying the functionality of systemd,
  it initializes a Linux system and starts relevant services that are defined in service
  unit files. Adversaries, malware and red teamers may abuse this this feature by
  stashing systemd service file to persist on the targetted or compromised host.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 11
search:
  selection1:
    TargetFilename:
    - '*/etc/systemd/system*'
    - '*/lib/systemd/system*'
    - '*/usr/lib/systemd/system*'
    - '*/run/systemd/system*'
    - '*~/.config/systemd/*'
    - '*~/.local/share/systemd/*'
    - '*/etc/systemd/user*'
    - '*/lib/systemd/user*'
    - '*/usr/lib/systemd/user*'
    - '*/run/systemd/user*'
    Filesystem.file_name: '*.service'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create file in systemd
  folders for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false
  positives.
