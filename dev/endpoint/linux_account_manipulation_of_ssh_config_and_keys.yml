status: production
type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of ssh key in a linux machine.
  attacker may delete or modify ssh key to impair some security features or act as
  defense evasion in compromised linux machine. This Anomaly can be also a good indicator
  of a malware trying to wipe or delete several files in a compromised host as part
  of its destructive payload like what acidrain malware does in linux or router machines.
  This detection can be a good pivot to check what process and user tries to delete
  this type of files which is not so common and need further investigation.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 11
search:
  selection1:
    TargetFilename:
    - /etc/ssh/*
    - ~/.ssh/*
    Filesystem.action: deleted
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
