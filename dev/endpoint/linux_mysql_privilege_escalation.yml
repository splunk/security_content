description: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Its name
  is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My,
  and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. If sudo right is given
  to mysql utility for the user, then the user can run system commands as root and
  possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*\!**'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*mysql*-e*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.
