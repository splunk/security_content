description: The following analytic identifies SSH being utilized to move laterally
  and execute a script or file on the remote host.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*oStrictHostKeyChecking*'
    - '*oConnectTimeout*'
    - '*oBatchMode*'
    Image|endswith: ssh
  selection2:
    CommandLine:
    - '*http:*'
    - '*https:*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: This is not a common command to be executed. Filter as needed.
