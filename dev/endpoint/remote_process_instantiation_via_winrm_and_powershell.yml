description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with arguments
  utilized to start a process on a remote endpoint by abusing the WinRM protocol.
  Specifically, this search looks for the abuse of the `Invoke-Command` commandlet.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse WinRM and `powershell.exe` for lateral
  movement and remote code execution.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: pwsh.dll
  selection2:
    Image|endswith:
    - powershell_ise.exe
    - powershell.exe
    - sqltoolsps.exe
    - sqlps.exe
    - pwsh.exe
  selection3:
    OriginalFileName: PowerShell.EXE
  selection4:
    OriginalFileName: powershell_ise.EXE
  selection5:
    CommandLine: '*-ComputerName*'
  selection6:
    CommandLine: '*Invoke-Command*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2 or selection3 or selection4) and selection5
    and selection6
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WinRM and `Invoke-Command` to start
  a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use cases. However,
  this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
