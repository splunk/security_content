description: 'The following hunting analytic identifies the use of `wmic.exe` enumerating
  local groups on the endpoint. 

  Typically, by itself, is not malicious but may raise suspicion based on time of
  day, endpoint and username. 

  During triage, review parallel processes and identify any further suspicious behavior.'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*group get name*'
    Image|endswith: wmic.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
