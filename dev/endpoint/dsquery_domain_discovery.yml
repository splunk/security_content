description: 'The following analytic identifies "dsquery.exe" execution with arguments
  looking for `TrustedDomain` query directly on the command-line. This is typically
  indicative of an Administrator or adversary perform domain trust discovery. Note
  that this query does not identify any other variations of "Dsquery.exe" usage.

  Within this detection, it is assumed `dsquery.exe` is not moved or renamed.

  The search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments
  were used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, process
  "dsquery.exe" and its parent process.

  DSQuery.exe is natively found in `C:\Windows\system32` and `C:\Windows\syswow64`
  and only on Server operating system.

  The following DLL(s) are loaded when DSQuery.exe is launched `dsquery.dll`. If found
  loaded by another process, it is possible dsquery is running within that process
  context in memory.

  In addition to trust discovery, review parallel processes for additional behaviors
  performed. Identify the parent process and capture any files (batch files, for example)
  being used.'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*trustedDomain*'
    Image|endswith: dsquery.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives. If there is a true false positive,
  filter based on command-line or parent process.
