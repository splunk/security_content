description: 'Fodhelper.exe has a known UAC bypass as it attempts to look for specific
  registry keys upon execution, that do not exist. Therefore, an attacker can write
  its malicious commands in these registry keys to be executed by fodhelper.exe with
  the highest privilege.

  * `HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`

  * `HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command\DelegateExecute`

  * `HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command\(default)`

  Upon triage, fodhelper.exe will have a child process and read access will occur
  on the registry keys. Isolate the endpoint and review parallel processes for additional
  behavior.'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    ParentImage: fodhelper.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited to no false positives are expected.
