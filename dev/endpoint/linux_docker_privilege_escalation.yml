description: Docker is an open source containerization platform. It helps programmers
  to bundle applications into containers, which are standardized executable parts
  that include the application source code along with the OS libraries and dependencies
  needed to run that code in any setting. The user can add mount the root directory
  into a container and edit the /etc/password file to add a super user. This requires
  the user to be privileged enough to run docker, i.e. being in the docker group or
  being root.

  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*docker*-v*/*:*'
    - '*docker*--volume*/*:*'
    - '*docker*exec*sh*'
    - '*docker*exec*bash*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.
