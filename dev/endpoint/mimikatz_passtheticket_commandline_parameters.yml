description: The following analytic looks for the use of Mimikatz command line parameters
  leveraged to execute pass the ticket attacks. Red teams and adversaries alike may
  use the pass the ticket technique using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally
  within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Defenders should
  be aware that adversaries may customize the source code of Mimikatz and modify the
  command line parameters. This would effectively bypass this analytic.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*kerberos::ptt*'
    - '*sekurlsa::tickets /export*'
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Although highly unlikely, legitimate applications may use the
  same command line parameters as Mimikatz.
