description: The search looks for a batch file (.bat) written to the Windows system
  directory tree.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Image|endswith: '*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: It is possible for this search to generate a notable event
  for a batch file write to a path that includes the string "system32", but is not
  the actual Windows system directory. As such, you should confirm the path of the
  batch file identified by the search. In addition, a false positive may be generated
  by an administrator copying a legitimate batch file in this directory tree. You
  should confirm that the activity is legitimate and modify the search to add exclusions,
  as necessary.
