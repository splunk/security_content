description: GDB is the acronym for GNU Debugger. This tool helps to debug the programs
  written in C, C++, Ada, Fortran, etc. The console can be opened using the gdb command
  on terminal. If sudo right is given to GDB tool for the user, then the user can
  run system commands as root and possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*-nx*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*gdb*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*-ex*!*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
