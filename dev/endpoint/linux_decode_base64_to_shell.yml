description: The following analytic identifies base64 being decoded and passed to
  a Linux shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*|*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine:
    - '*base64 -d*'
    - '*base64 --decode*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on legitimate software
  being utilized. Filter as needed.
