description: 'The following analytic identifies the Windows InstallUtil.exe binary
  making a remote network connection. This technique may be used to download and execute
  code while bypassing application control. 

  When `InstallUtil.exe` is used in a malicous manner, the path to an executable on
  the filesystem is typically specified. Take note of the parent process. In a suspicious
  instance, this will be spawned from a non-standard process like `Cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`
  or `Explorer.exe`. 

  If used by a developer, typically this will be found with multiple command-line
  switches/arguments and spawn from Visual Studio. 

  During triage review resulting network connections, file modifications, and parallel
  processes. Capture any artifacts and review further.'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: InstallUtil.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: installutil.exe
  condition: (selection1 or selection2)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Ports` node.
  In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest
  TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives should be present as InstallUtil is
  not typically used to download remote files. Filter as needed based on Developers
  requirements.
