type: Hunting
description: The following hunting analytic is meant to help organizations understand
  what remote access software is being used in the environment. When reviewing this
  hunt, confirm the software identified is authorized to be utilized. Based on fidelity,
  create a new analytic for specific utilities banned within the organization. Adversaries
  use these utilities to retain remote access capabilities to the environment. Utilities
  in the lookup include AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, TeamViewer and much more. Review
  the lookup for the entire list and add any others.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    User: unknown
    Computer: unknown
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives will be found. Filter as needed and create
  higher fidelity analytics based off banned remote access software.
