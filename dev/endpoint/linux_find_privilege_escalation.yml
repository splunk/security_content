description: Find is a command-line utility that locates files based on some user-specified
  criteria and either prints the pathname of each matched object or, if another action
  is requested, performs that action on each matched object. If sudo right is given
  to find utility for the user, then the user can run system commands as root and
  possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*-exec*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*find*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.
