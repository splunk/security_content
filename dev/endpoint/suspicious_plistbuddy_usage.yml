description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of a native MacOS utility,
  PlistBuddy, creating or modifying a properly list (.plist) file. In the instance
  of Silver Sparrow, the following commands were executed:

  * PlistBuddy -c "Add :Label string init_verx" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist

  * PlistBuddy -c "Add :RunAtLoad bool true" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist

  * PlistBuddy -c "Add :StartInterval integer 3600" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist

  * PlistBuddy -c "Add :ProgramArguments array" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist

  * PlistBuddy -c "Add :ProgramArguments:0 string /bin/sh" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist

  * PlistBuddy -c "Add :ProgramArguments:1 string -c" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist

  Upon triage, capture the property list file being written to disk and review for
  further indicators. Contain the endpoint and triage further.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications may use PlistBuddy to create or
  modify property lists and possibly generate false positives. Review the property
  list being modified or created to confirm.
