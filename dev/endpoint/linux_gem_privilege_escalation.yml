description: RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that
  provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained
  format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems,
  and a server for distributing them. If sudo right is given to GEM utility for the
  user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*-c*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*gem*open*-e*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
