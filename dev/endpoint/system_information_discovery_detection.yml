search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*hostname*'
    - '*systeminfo*'
    - '*wmic* qfe*'
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
