  an Azure AD tenant that fails during the Multi Factor Authentication challenge.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of  Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from  Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events in your Splunk environment.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Legitimate users may miss to reply the MFA challenge within
  the time window or deny it by mistake.
