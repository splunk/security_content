description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD user enabling a previously
  disabled account and resetting its password within 2 minutes. This behavior could
  represent an adversary who has obtained administrative access and is trying to establish
  a backdoor identity within an Azure AD tenant.
data_source: []
search: ' `azuread` (body.operationName="Enable account" OR body.operationName="Reset
  password (by admin)" OR body.operationName="Update user") | transaction body.properties.targetResources{}.userPrincipalName
  startsWith=(body.operationName="Enable account") endsWith=(body.operationName="Reset
  password (by admin)") maxspan=2m | rename body.properties.* as * | rename targetResources{}.userPrincipalName

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: While not common, Administrators may enable accounts and reset
  their passwords for legitimate reasons. Filter as needed.
