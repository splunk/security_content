description: The following analytic triggers on a high risk sign-in against Azure
  Active Directory identified by Azure Identity Protection. Identity Protection monitors
  sign-in events using heuristics and machine learning to identify potentially malicious
  events and categorizes them in three categories high, medium and low.
data_source: []
search: ' `azuread` body.category=UserRiskEvents body.properties.riskLevel=high |
  rename body.properties.* as * |  stats values(userPrincipalName) by _time, ipAddress,
  activity, riskLevel, riskEventType, additionalInfo | `azure_active_directory_high_risk_sign_in_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of  Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from  Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events in your Splunk environment.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the RiskyUsers and UserRiskEvents log category.
known_false_positives: Details for the risk calculation algorithm used by Identity
  Protection are unknown and may be prone to false positives.
