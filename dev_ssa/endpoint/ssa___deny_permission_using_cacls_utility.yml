description: The following analytic identifies the use of `cacls.exe`, `icacls.exe`
  or `xcacls.exe` placing the deny permission on a file or directory. Adversaries
  perform this behavior to prevent responders from reviewing or gaining access to
  adversary files on disk.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.file.name:
    - icacls.exe
    - xcacls.exe
    - cacls.exe
    process.cmd_line|re: deny
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed icacls.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: System administrators may use cacls utilities but this is not
  a common practice. Filter as needed.
