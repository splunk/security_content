description: The following analytic identifies "mshta.exe" execution with inline protocol
  handlers. "JavaScript", "VBScript", and "About" are the only supported options when
  invoking HTA content directly on the command-line. The search will return the first
  time and last time these command-line arguments were used for these executions,
  as well as the target system, the user, process "mshta.exe" and its parent process.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.cmd_line|contains:
    - about
    - javascript
    - vbscript
    process.file.name: mshta.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
