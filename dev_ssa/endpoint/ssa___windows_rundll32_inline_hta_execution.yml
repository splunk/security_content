description: The following analytic identifies "rundll32.exe" execution with inline
  protocol handlers. "JavaScript", "VBScript", and "About" are the only supported
  options when invoking HTA content directly on the command-line. This type of behavior
  is commonly observed with fileless malware or application whitelisting bypass techniques.
  The search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments
  were used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, process
  "rundll32.exe" and its parent process.

  selection1:
    process.cmd_line|contains:
    - about
    - javascript
    - vbscript
    process.file.name: rundll32.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
