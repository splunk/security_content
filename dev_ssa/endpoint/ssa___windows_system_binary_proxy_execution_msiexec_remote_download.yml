description: The following analytic identifies msiexec.exe with http in the command-line.
  This procedure will utilize msiexec.exe to download a remote file and load it. During
  triage, review parallel processes and capture any artifacts on disk for review.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process|contains:
    - https://
    - http://
    process_name: msiexec.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter by destination or parent
  process as needed.
