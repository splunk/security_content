description: The following analytic detects the creation of local administrator accounts using the net.exe command 
  to mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access and prevent further damage to the environment by responding 
  to potential threats earlier and taking appropriate actions to protect the organization's systems and data. 
  This detection is made by a Splunk query to search for processes with the name net.exe or net1.exe that include the "/add" 
  parameter in their process name. 
  This detection is important because the creation of unauthorized local user accounts might indicate that an attacker 
  has successfully created a new user account and is trying to gain persistent access to a system or escalate their 
  privileges for data theft, or other malicious activities. False positives might occur since there might be legitimate uses of the net.exe 
  command and the creation of user accounts in certain circumstances. 
  You must consider the context of the activity and other indicators of compromise before taking any action. For next steps, 
  review the details of the identified process, including the user, parent process, and parent process name. 
  Examine any relevant on-disk artifacts and look for concurrent processes to determine the source of the attack.

search:
  selection1:
    process.cmd_line|contains: user
  selection2:
    process.cmd_line|contains: /add
  selection3:
    process.file.name:
    - net.exe
    - net1.exe
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3 
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: System administrators or scripts may add user accounts via
  this technique. Filter as needed.
