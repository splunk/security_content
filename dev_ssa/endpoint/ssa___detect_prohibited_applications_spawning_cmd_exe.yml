description: The following analytic identifies parent processes, browsers, Windows
  terminal applications, Office Products and Java spawning cmd.exe. By its very nature,
  many applications spawn cmd.exe natively or built into macros. Much of this will
  need to be tuned to further enhance the risk.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: 
  selection1:
    parent_process_name:
      - winword.exe
      - excel.exe
      - outlook.exe
      - acrobat.exe
      - acrord32.exe
      - iexplore.exe
      - opera.exe
      - firefox.exe
      - powershell.exe
  selection2:
    parent_process_name: java.exe
  selection3:
    parent_process_name|re: patch1-Hotfix1a
  selection4:
    parent_process_name: chrome.exe
  selection5:
    process: chrome-extension
  condition: selection1 or (selection2 and not selection3) or (selection4 and not selection5)
how_to_implement: In order to successfully implement this analytic, you will need
  endpoint process data from a EDR product or Sysmon. This search has been modified
  to process raw sysmon data from attack_range's nxlogs on DSP.
known_false_positives: There are circumstances where an application may legitimately
  execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface.

  message: An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified
    on endpoint $dest_device_id$ by user $dest_user_id$, producing a suspicious event
    that warrants investigating.
