description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of the `Get-DomainUser` commandlet with specific parameters.
  `Get-DomainUser` is part of PowerView, a PowerShell tool used to perform enumeration
  on Windows Active Directory networks. As the name suggests, `Get-DomainUser` is
  used to identify domain users and combining it with `-PreauthNotRequired` allows
  adversaries to discover domain accounts with Kerberos Pre Authentication disabled.
  
  Red Teams and adversaries alike use may leverage PowerView to enumerate these accounts
  and attempt to crack their passwords offline.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
