description: The vssadmin.exe utility is used to interact with the Volume Shadow Copy Service. Wmic is an interface to the Windows Management Instrumentation.  This search looks for either of these tools being used to delete shadow copies.

  selection1:
    process.file.name: 
    - vssadmin.exe

  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product.
known_false_positives: System administrators may resize the shadowstorage for valid purposes. Filter as needed.
