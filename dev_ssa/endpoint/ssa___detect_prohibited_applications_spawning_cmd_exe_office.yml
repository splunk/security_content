description: The following analytic identifies parent processes that are office/productivity applications, spawning cmd.exe. By its very nature,
  many applications spawn cmd.exe natively or built into macros. Much of this will
  need to be tuned to further enhance the risk.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    actor.process.file.name:
    - winword.exe
    - excel.exe
    - outlook.exe
    - acrobat.exe
    - acrord32.exe
  selection2:
    process.file.name: cmd.exe
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: In order to successfully implement this analytic, you will need
  endpoint process data from a EDR product or Sysmon. This search has been modified
  to process raw sysmon data from attack_range's nxlogs on DSP.
known_false_positives: There are circumstances where an application may legitimately
  execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface.

  message: An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified
    on endpoint $dest_device_id$ by user $dest_user_id$, producing a suspicious event
    that warrants investigating.
