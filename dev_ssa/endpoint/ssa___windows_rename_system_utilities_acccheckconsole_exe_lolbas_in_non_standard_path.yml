description: The following analytic identifies AccCheckConsole.exe which is a native
  living off the land binary or script (LOLBAS) within the Windows operating system
  that may be abused by adversaries by moving it to a new directory. The list of binaries
  was derived from the https://lolbas-project.github.io site. The specific default filepath for AccCheckConsole.exe is within "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22000.0\".
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.file.name: acccheckconsole.exe
  selection2:
    process.file.path|re: \\program files \(x86\)\\windows kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.22000.0\\(x86|x64|arm|arm64)\\accchecker\\
  condition: selection1 and not selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting logs
  with the process name, command-line arguments, and parent processes from your endpoints.
  Collect endpoint data such as Sysmon or Windows Events 4688.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may be required.
  Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application
  in use.
