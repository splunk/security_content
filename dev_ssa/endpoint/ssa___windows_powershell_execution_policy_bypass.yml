description: The following analytic detects the initiation of PowerShell processes with parameters specifically designed to bypass the local script execution policy. 
  It identifies this behavior by searching for commandline arguments that are commonly used in malicious activities to circumvent the built-in security mechanisms 
  of PowerShell. This detection is crucial for a Security Operations Center (SOC) as bypassing the execution policy can allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts, 
  leading to unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, or further system compromise. The impact of such an attack can be significant, potentially resulting in the 
  loss of sensitive information or control over critical systems.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.file.name:
    - powershell_ise.exe
    - powershell.exe
    - sqltoolsps.exe
    - sqlps.exe
    - pwsh.exe
    - pwsh.exe
  selection2:
    process.cmd_line|re: Bypass
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons to bypass the PowerShell execution
  policy. The PowerShell script being run with this parameter should be validated
  to ensure that it is legitimate.
