description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious child process of MSBuild spawned
  by Windows Script Host - cscript or wscript. This behavior or event are commonly
  seen and used by malware or adversaries to execute malicious msbuild process using
  malicious script in the compromised host. During triage, review parallel processes
  and identify any file modifications. MSBuild may load a script from the same path
  without having command-line arguments.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.file.name: MSBuild.exe
    actor.process.file.name|re:
    - cscript.exe
    - wscript.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as developers do not spawn
  MSBuild via a WSH.
