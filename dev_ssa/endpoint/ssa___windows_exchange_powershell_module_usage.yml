description: 'The following analytic identifies the usage of Exchange PowerShell modules
  that were recently used for a proof of concept related to ProxyShell. Currently,
  there is no active data shared or data we could re-produce relate to this part of
  the ProxyShell chain of exploits.  \

  Inherently, the usage of the modules is not malicious, but reviewing parallel processes,
  and user, of the session will assist with determining the intent. \

  Module - New-MailboxExportRequest will begin the process of exporting contents of
  a primary mailbox or archive to a .pst file. \

  Module - New-managementroleassignment can assign a management role to a management
  role group, management role assignment policy, user, or universal security group
  (USG). \

  Module - New-MailboxSearch cmdlet to create a mailbox search and either get an estimate
  of search results, place search results on In-Place Hold or copy them to a Discovery
  mailbox. You can also place all contents in a mailbox on hold by not specifying
  a search query, which accomplishes similar results as Litigation Hold. \ Module
  - Get-Recipient cmdlet to view existing recipient objects in your organization.
  This cmdlet returns all mail-enabled objects (for example, mailboxes, mail users,
  mail contacts, and distribution groups).'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
  This will only work with Multiline event logs, not XML.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this PowerShell commandlet
