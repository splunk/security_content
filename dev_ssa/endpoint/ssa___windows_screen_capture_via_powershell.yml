description: The following analytic identifies a potential PowerShell script that captures screen images on compromised or targeted hosts. This technique was observed in the Winter-Vivern malware, which attempts to capture desktop screens using a PowerShell script and send the images to its C2 server as part of its exfiltration strategy. This TTP serves as a useful indicator that a PowerShell process may be gathering desktop screenshots from a host system, potentially signaling malicious activity.
