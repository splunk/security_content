description: The following query identifies Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer
  Service utility `bitsadmin.exe` scheduling a BITS job to persist on an endpoint.
  The query identifies the parameters used to create, resume or add a file to a BITS
  job. Typically seen combined in a oneliner or ran in sequence. If identified, review
  the BITS job created and capture any files written to disk. It is possible for BITS
  to be used to upload files and this may require further network data analysis to
  identify. You can use `bitsadmin /list /verbose` to list out the jobs during investigation.

search:
  selection1:
    process|contains:
    - resume
    - setcustomheaders
    - setminretrydelay
    - setnotifycmdline
    - setnotifyflags
    - addfile
    - create
    process_name: bitsadmin.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives will be present. Typically, applications
  will use `BitsAdmin.exe`. Any filtering should be done based on command-line arguments
  (legitimate applications) or parent process.
