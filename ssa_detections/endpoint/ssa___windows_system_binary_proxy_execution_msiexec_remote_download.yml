description: The following analytic identifies msiexec.exe with http in the command-line.
  This procedure will utilize msiexec.exe to download a remote file and load it. During
  triage, review parallel processes and capture any artifacts on disk for review.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name

  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where (process_cmd_line LIKE "%https://%"
  OR process_cmd_line LIKE "%http://%") AND process_file_name="msiexec.exe" --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter by destination or parent
  process as needed.
