description: The following analytic detects the initiation of PowerShell processes
  with parameters specifically designed to bypass the local script execution policy.
  It identifies this behavior by searching for commandline arguments that are commonly
  used in malicious activities to circumvent the built-in security mechanisms of PowerShell.
  This detection is crucial for a Security Operations Center (SOC) as bypassing the
  execution policy can allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts, leading to unauthorized
  actions, data exfiltration, or further system compromise. The impact of such an
  attack can be significant, potentially resulting in the loss of sensitive information
  or control over critical systems.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name
  | eval actor_process = actor.process | eval actor_process_pid = actor_process.pid
  | eval actor_process_file = actor_process.file | eval actor_process_file_path =
  actor_process_file.path | eval actor_process_file_name = actor_process_file.name
  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where (process_file_name IN ("powershell_ise.exe",
  "powershell.exe", "sqltoolsps.exe", "sqlps.exe", "pwsh.exe", "pwsh.exe")) AND match(process_cmd_line,
  /(?i)Bypass/)=true --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons to bypass the PowerShell execution
  policy. The PowerShell script being run with this parameter should be validated
  to ensure that it is legitimate.
