description: This analytic focuses on identifying suspicious command-line parameters
  commonly associated with the use of Impacket wmiexec.py. Impacket is a set of Python
  classes designed for working with Microsoft network protocols, and it includes several
  scripts like wmiexec.py, smbexec.py, dcomexec.py, and atexec.py that enable command
  execution on remote endpoints. These scripts typically utilize administrative shares
  and hardcoded parameters, which can serve as signatures to detect their usage. Both
  Red Teams and adversaries may employ Impacket tools for lateral movement and remote
  code execution purposes. By monitoring for these specific command-line indicators,
  the analytic aims to detect potentially malicious activities related to Impacket
  tool usage.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although uncommon, Administrators may leverage Impackets tools
  to start a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use
  cases.
