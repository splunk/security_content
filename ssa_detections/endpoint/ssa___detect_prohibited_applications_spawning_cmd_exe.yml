description: The following analytic identifies parent processes, browsers, Windows
  terminal applications, Office Products and Java spawning cmd.exe. By its very nature,
  many applications spawn cmd.exe natively or built into macros. Much of this will
  need to be tuned to further enhance the risk.

how_to_implement: In order to successfully implement this analytic, you will need
  endpoint process data from a EDR product or Sysmon. This search has been modified
  to process raw sysmon data from attack_range's nxlogs on DSP.
known_false_positives: There are circumstances where an application may legitimately
  execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface.

    on endpoint $dest_device_id$ by user $dest_user_id$, producing a suspicious event
    that warrants investigating.
