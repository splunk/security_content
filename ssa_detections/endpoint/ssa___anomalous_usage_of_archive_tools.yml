description: The following detection identifies the usage of archive tools from the
  command line.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name

  actor_process_file.path | eval actor_process_file_name = actor_process_file.name
  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where (process_file_name="winrar.exe"
  OR process_file_name LIKE "7z%" OR process_file_name LIKE "winzip%") AND (actor_process_file_name
  LIKE "%powershell.exe" OR actor_process_file_name LIKE "%cmd.exe") --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: False positives can be ligitmate usage of archive tools from
  the command line.

  message: An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified
    on endpoint $dest$ by user $user$. This behavior is indicative of suspicious loading
    of 7zip.
