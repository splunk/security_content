description: The following analytic identifies the use of the findstr command employed
  to search for unsecured credentials Group Policy Preferences (GPP). GPP are tools
  that allow administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. These
  policies allow administrators to set local accounts. These group policies are stored
  in SYSVOL on a domain controller. This means that any domain user can view the SYSVOL
  share and decrypt the password (using the AES key that has been made public). While
  Microsoft released a patch that impedes Administrators to create unsecure credentials,
  existing Group Policy Preferences files with passwords are not removed from SYSVOL.

search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name
  | eval actor_process = actor.process | eval actor_process_pid = actor_process.pid
  | eval actor_process_file = actor_process.file | eval actor_process_file_path =
  actor_process_file.path | eval actor_process_file_name = actor_process_file.name
  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where process_file_name="findstr.exe"
  AND process_cmd_line LIKE "%cpassword%" --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage findstr to find passwords in GPO
  to validate exposure. Filter as needed.
