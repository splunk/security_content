description: The vssadmin.exe utility is used to interact with the Volume Shadow Copy
  Service. Wmic is an interface to the Windows Management Instrumentation.  This search
  looks for either of these tools being used to delete shadow copies.

- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product.
known_false_positives: System administrators may resize the shadowstorage for valid
  purposes. Filter as needed.
