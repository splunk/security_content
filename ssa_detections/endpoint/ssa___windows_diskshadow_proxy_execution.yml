description: DiskShadow.exe is a Microsoft Signed binary present on Windows Server.
  It has a scripting mode intended for complex scripted backup operations. This feature
  also allows for execution of arbitrary unsigned code. This analytic looks for the
  usage of the scripting mode flags in executions of DiskShadow. During triage, compare
  to known backup behavior in your environment and then review the scripts called
  by diskshadow.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on processes that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint_Processess` datamodel.
known_false_positives: Administrators using the DiskShadow tool in their infrastructure
  as a main backup tool with scripts will cause false positives
