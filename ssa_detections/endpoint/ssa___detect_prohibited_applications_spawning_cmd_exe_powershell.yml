name: Detect Prohibited Applications Spawning cmd exe powershell

description: The following analytic identifies parent processes that are powershell,
  spawning cmd.exe. By its very nature, many applications spawn cmd.exe natively or
  built into macros. Much of this will need to be tuned to further enhance the risk.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name
  | eval actor_process = actor.process | eval actor_process_pid = actor_process.pid
  | eval actor_process_file = actor_process.file | eval actor_process_file_path =
  actor_process_file.path | eval actor_process_file_name = lower(actor_process_file.name)
  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where actor_process_file_name="powershell.exe"
  AND process_file_name="cmd.exe" --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: In order to successfully implement this analytic, you will need
  endpoint process data from a EDR product or Sysmon. This search has been modified
  to process raw sysmon data from attack_range's nxlogs on DSP.
known_false_positives: There are circumstances where an application may legitimately
  execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface.
