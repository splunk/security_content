description: CertUtil.exe may be used to `encode` and `decode` a file, including PE
  and script code. Encoding will convert a file to base64 with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`
  and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` tags. Malicious usage will include decoding a encoded
  file that was downloaded. Once decoded, it will be loaded by a parallel process.
  Note that there are two additional command switches that may be used - `encodehex`
  and `decodehex`. Similarly, the file will be encoded in HEX and later decoded for
  further execution. During triage, identify the source of the file being decoded.
  Review its contents or execution behavior for further analysis.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Typically seen used to `encode` files, but it is possible to
  see legitimate use of `decode`. Filter based on parent-child relationship, file
  paths, endpoint or user.
