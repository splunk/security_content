description: The following analytic identifies hh.exe (HTML Help) execution of a Compiled
  HTML Help (CHM) file using InfoTech Storage Handlers. This particular technique
  will load Windows script code from a compiled help file, using InfoTech Storage
  Handlers. itss.dll will load upon execution. Three InfoTech Storage handlers are
  supported - ms-its, its, mk:@MSITStore. ITSS may be used to launch a specific html/htm
  file from within a CHM file. CHM files may contain nearly any file type embedded.
  Upon a successful execution, the following script engines may be used for execution
  - JScript, VBScript, VBScript.Encode, JScript.Encode, JScript.Compact. Analyst may
  identify vbscript.dll or jscript.dll loading into hh.exe upon execution. The "htm"
  and "html" file extensions were the only extensions observed to be supported for
  the execution of Shortcut commands or WSH script code. During investigation, identify
  script content origination. hh.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and
  C:\Windows\syswow64.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: It is rare to see instances of InfoTech Storage Handlers being
  used, but it does happen in some legitimate instances. Filter as needed.
