description: The following analytic identifies the use of `reg.exe` attempting to
  export Windows registry keys that contain hashed credentials. Adversaries will utilize
  this technique to capture and perform offline password cracking.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path

  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name

  process_file_name="cmd.exe") AND (match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System/)=true

  AND match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)save/)=true --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: None identified.
