description: The following analytic identifies the use of `reg.exe` attempting to
  export Windows registry keys that contain hashed credentials. Adversaries will utilize
  this technique to capture and perform offline password cracking.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name
  | eval actor_process = actor.process | eval actor_process_pid = actor_process.pid

  actor_process_file.path | eval actor_process_file_name = actor_process_file.name
  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where (process_file_name IN ("reg.exe",
  "cmd.exe")) AND (match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System/)=true
  OR match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SAM/)=true OR match(process_cmd_line,
  /(?i)HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Security/)=true OR match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)HKLM\\System/)=true
  OR match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)HKLM\\SAM/)=true OR match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)HKLM\\Security/)=true)
  AND match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)save/)=true --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
