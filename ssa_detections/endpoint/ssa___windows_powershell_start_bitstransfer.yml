description: Start-BitsTransfer is the PowerShell "version" of BitsAdmin.exe. Similar
  functionality is present. This technique variation is not as commonly used by adversaries,
  but has been abused in the past. Lesser known uses include the ability to set the
  `-TransferType` to `Upload` for exfiltration of files. In an instance where `Upload`
  is used, it is highly possible files will be archived. During triage, review parallel
  processes and process lineage. Capture any files on disk and review. For the remote
  domain or IP, what is the reputation?

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint_Processess` datamodel.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives. It is possible administrators will
  utilize Start-BitsTransfer for administrative tasks, otherwise filter based parent
  process or command-line arguments.
