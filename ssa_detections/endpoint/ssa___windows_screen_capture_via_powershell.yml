status: validation
description: The following analytic identifies a potential PowerShell script that
  captures screen images on compromised or targeted hosts. This technique was observed
  in the Winter-Vivern malware, which attempts to capture desktop screens using a
  PowerShell script and send the images to its C2 server as part of its exfiltration
  strategy. This TTP serves as a useful indicator that a PowerShell process may be
  gathering desktop screenshots from a host system, potentially signaling malicious
  activity.
data_source:
- Powershell 4104
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval device_hostname = device.hostname | eval process_file = process.file | eval
  process_file_path = process_file.path | eval process_uid = process.uid | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_uid = actor_user.uid
  | where match(process_cmd_line, /(?i).CopyFromScreen/)=true --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
