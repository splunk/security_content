description: This analytic identifies an endpoint that remotely connects to another
  endpoint to create a new service using sc.exe. On the remote endpoint, the new service
  will be created and this action will trigger the creation of EventCode 7045 along
  with all the resulting service information.

search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Note that false positives may occur, and filtering may be necessary,
  especially when it comes to remote service creation by administrators or software
  management utilities.
