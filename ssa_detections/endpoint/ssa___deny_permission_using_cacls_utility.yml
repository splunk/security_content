description: The following analytic identifies the use of `cacls.exe`, `icacls.exe`
  or `xcacls.exe` placing the deny permission on a file or directory. Adversaries
  perform this behavior to prevent responders from reviewing or gaining access to
  adversary files on disk.

search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = process_file.name | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name
  | eval actor_process = actor.process | eval actor_process_pid = actor_process.pid

  actor_process_file.path | eval actor_process_file_name = actor_process_file.name
  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where (process_file_name="icacls.exe"
  OR process_file_name="xcacls.exe" OR process_file_name="cacls.exe") AND match(process_cmd_line,
  /(?i)deny/)=true --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed icacls.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: System administrators may use cacls utilities but this is not
  a common practice. Filter as needed.
