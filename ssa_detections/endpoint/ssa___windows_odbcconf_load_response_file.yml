description: The following analytic identifies the odbcconf.exe, Windows Open Database
  Connectivity utility, loading up a resource file. The file extension is arbitrary
  and may be named anything. The resource file itself may have different commands
  supported by Odbcconf to load up a DLL (REGSVR) on disk or additional commands.
  During triage, review file modifications and parallel processes.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may need to occur
  based on legitimate application usage. Filter as needed.
