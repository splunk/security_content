description: The following analytic identifies the odbcconf.exe, Windows Open Database
  Connectivity utility, loading up a resource file. The file extension is arbitrary
  and may be named anything. The resource file itself may have different commands
  supported by Odbcconf to load up a DLL (REGSVR) on disk or additional commands.
  During triage, review file modifications and parallel processes.

search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name

  OR process_cmd_line LIKE "%-f %") AND process_file_name="odbcconf.exe") AND process_cmd_line
  LIKE "%.rsp%" --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may need to occur
  based on legitimate application usage. Filter as needed.
