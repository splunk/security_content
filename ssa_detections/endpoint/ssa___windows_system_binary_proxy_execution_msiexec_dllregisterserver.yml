description: The following analytic identifies the usage of msiexec.exe using the
  /y switch parameter, which grants the ability for msiexec to load DLLRegisterServer.
  Upon triage, review parent process and capture any artifacts for further review.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = process_file.name | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name
  | eval actor_process = actor.process | eval actor_process_pid = actor_process.pid
  | eval actor_process_file = actor_process.file | eval actor_process_file_path =
  actor_process_file.path | eval actor_process_file_name = actor_process_file.name
  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where (process_cmd_line LIKE "%-y %"
  OR process_cmd_line LIKE "%/y %") AND process_file_name="msiexec.exe" --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: This analytic will need to be tuned for your environment based
  on legitimate usage of msiexec.exe. Filter as needed.
