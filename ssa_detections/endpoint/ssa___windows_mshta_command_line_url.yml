description: This analytic identifies when Microsoft HTML Application Host (mshta.exe)
  utility is used to make remote http connections. Adversaries may use mshta.exe to
  proxy the download and execution of remote .hta files. The analytic identifies command
  line arguments of http and https being used. This technique is commonly used by
  malicious software to bypass preventative controls. The search will return the first
  time and last time these command-line arguments were used for these executions,
  as well as the target system, the user, process "rundll32.exe" and its parent process.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: It is possible legitimate applications may perform this behavior
  and will need to be filtered.
