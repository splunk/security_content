name: Windows Default Group Policy Object Modified with GPME

description: The following analytic identifies the potential edition of a default
  Group Policy Object. A fresh installation of an Active Directory network will typically
  contain two default group policy objects `Default Domain Controllers Policy` and
  `Default Domain Policy`. The default domain controllers policy is used to enforce
  and set policies to all the domain controllers within the domain environment. The
  default domain policy is linked to all users and computers by default. An adversary
  who has obtained privileged access to an Active Directory network may modify the
  default group policy objects to obtain further access, deploy persistence or execute
  malware across a large number of hosts. Security teams should monitor the edition
  of the default GPOs.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: The default Group Policy Objects within an AD network may be
  legitimately updated for administrative operations, filter as needed.
