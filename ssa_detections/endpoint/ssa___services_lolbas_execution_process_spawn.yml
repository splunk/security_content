description: The following analytic identifies services.exe spawning a LOLBAS execution
  process. When adversaries execute code on remote endpoints abusing the Service Control
  Manager and creating a remote malicious service, the executed command is spawned
  as a child process of services.exe. The LOLBAS project documents Windows native
  binaries that can be abused by threat actors to perform tasks like executing malicious
  code. Looking for child processes of services.exe that are part of the LOLBAS project
  can help defenders identify lateral movement activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the Processes node of the Endpoint
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There are circumstances where the services application may
  legitimately execute and spawn a windows native binary to do an activity that is
  benign.
