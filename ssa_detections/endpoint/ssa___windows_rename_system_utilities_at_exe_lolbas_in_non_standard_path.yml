description: The following analytic identifies At.exe which is a native living off
  the land binary or script (LOLBAS) within the Windows operating system that may
  be abused by adversaries by moving it to a new directory. The list of binaries was
  derived from the https://lolbas-project.github.io site.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name

  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where process_file_name="at.exe" AND
  (NOT match(process_file_path, /(?i)\\windows\\syswow64/)=true) --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting logs
  with the process name, command-line arguments, and parent processes from your endpoints.
  Collect endpoint data such as Sysmon or Windows Events 4688.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may be required.
  Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application
  in use.
