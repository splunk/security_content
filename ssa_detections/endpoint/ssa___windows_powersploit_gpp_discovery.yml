description: The following analytic identifies the use of the Get-GPPPassword PowerShell
  commandlet employed to search for unsecured credentials Group Policy Preferences
  (GPP). GPP are tools that allow administrators to create domain policies with embedded
  credentials. These policies allow administrators to set local accounts. These group
  policies are stored in SYSVOL on a domain controller. This means that any domain
  user can view the SYSVOL share and decrypt the password (using the AES key that
  has been made public). While Microsoft released a patch that impedes Administrators
  to create unsecure credentials, existing Group Policy Preferences files with passwords
  are not removed from SYSVOL.
data_source:
- Powershell 4104
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval device_hostname = device.hostname | eval process_file = process.file | eval
  process_file_path = process_file.path | eval process_uid = process.uid | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_uid = actor_user.uid
  | where match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)get-gpppassword/)=true --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
