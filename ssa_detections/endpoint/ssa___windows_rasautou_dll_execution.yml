description: The following analytic identifies the Windows Windows Remote Auto Dialer,
  rasautou.exe executing an arbitrary DLL. This technique is used to execute arbitrary
  shellcode or DLLs via the rasautou.exe LOLBin capability. During triage, review
  parent and child process behavior including file and image loads.

search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name

  AND match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)-p /)=true AND match(process_cmd_line, /(?i)-d
  /)=true --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to applications that require
  Rasautou.exe to load a DLL from disk. Filter as needed.
