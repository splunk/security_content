description: this search is to detect execution of `cipher.exe` to clear the unallocated
  sectors of a specific disk. This technique was seen in some ransomware to make it
  impossible to forensically recover deleted files.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name
  | eval actor_process = actor.process | eval actor_process_pid = actor_process.pid
  | eval actor_process_file = actor_process.file | eval actor_process_file_path =
  actor_process_file.path | eval actor_process_file_name = actor_process_file.name
  | eval device_hostname = device.hostname | where process_file_name="cipher.exe"
  AND process_cmd_line LIKE "%/w:%" --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
