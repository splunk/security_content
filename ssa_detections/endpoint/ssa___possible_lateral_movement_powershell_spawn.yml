description: 'The following analytic is designed to identify possible lateral movement
  attacks that involve the spawning of a PowerShell process as a child or grandchild
  process of commonly abused processes. These processes include services.exe, wmiprsve.exe,
  svchost.exe, wsmprovhost.exe, and mmc.exe.\

  Such behavior is indicative of legitimate Windows features such as the Service Control
  Manager, Windows Management Instrumentation, Task Scheduler, Windows Remote Management,
  and the DCOM protocol being abused to start a process on a remote endpoint. This
  behavior is often seen during lateral movement techniques where adversaries or red
  teams abuse these services for lateral movement and remote code execution.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may spawn PowerShell as a child process
  of the the identified processes. Filter as needed.
