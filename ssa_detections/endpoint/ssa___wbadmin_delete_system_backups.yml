description: This search looks for flags passed to wbadmin.exe (Windows Backup Administrator
  Tool) that delete backup files. This is typically used by ransomware to prevent
  recovery.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |

  OR process_cmd_line LIKE "%delete%") --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint_Processess` datamodel.
known_false_positives: Administrators may modify the boot configuration.
