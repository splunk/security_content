description: This search looks for outbound ICMP packets with a packet size larger
  than 1,000 bytes. Various threat actors have been known to use ICMP as a command
  and control channel for their attack infrastructure. Large ICMP packets from an
  endpoint to a remote host may be indicative of this activity.
how_to_implement: 'In order to run this search effectively, we highly recommend that
  you leverage the Assets and Identity framework. It is important that you have a
  good understanding of how your network segments are designed and that you are able
  to distinguish internal from external address space. Add a category named `internal`
  to the CIDRs that host the company''s assets in the `assets_by_cidr.csv` lookup
  file, which is located in `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-IdentityManagement/lookups/`.
  More information on updating this lookup can be found here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.0.0/Admin/Addassetandidentitydata.
  This search also requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating
  the Network_Traffic data model'

known_false_positives: ICMP packets are used in a variety of ways to help troubleshoot
  networking issues and ensure the proper flow of traffic. As such, it is possible
  that a large ICMP packet could be perfectly legitimate. If large ICMP packets are
  associated with command and control traffic, there will typically be a large number
  of these packets observed over time. If the search is providing a large number of
  false positives, you can modify the search to adjust the byte threshold or whitelist
  specific IP addresses, as necessary.
