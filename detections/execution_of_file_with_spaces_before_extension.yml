description: This search looks for processes launched from files with at least five
  spaces in the name before the extension. This is typically done to obfuscate the
  file extension by pushing it outside of the default view.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4
  of the Sysmon TA.
