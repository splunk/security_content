description: The fsutil.exe application is a legitimate Windows utility used to perform
  tasks related to the file allocation table (FAT) and NTFS file systems. The update
  sequence number (USN) change journal provides a log of all changes made to the files
  on the disk. This search looks for fsutil.exe deleting the USN journal.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
