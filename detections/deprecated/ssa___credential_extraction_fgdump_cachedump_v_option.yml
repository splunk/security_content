description: The following analytic identifies the use of CacheDump with the `-v`
  parameter to dump cached credentials on the associated endpoint. Adversaries use
  Cachedump as it is a publicly-available tool that extracts cached password hashes
  from a system's registry.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited as this analytic targets specific
  credential dumping process names. Filter as needed.
