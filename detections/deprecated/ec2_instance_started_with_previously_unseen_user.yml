  created them before. This search is deprecated and have been translated to use the
  latest Change Datamodel.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen EC2 Launches By
  User" support search once to create a history of previously seen ARNs.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a user will start to create EC2 instances
  when they haven't before for any number of reasons. Verify with the user that is
  launching instances that this is the intended behavior.
