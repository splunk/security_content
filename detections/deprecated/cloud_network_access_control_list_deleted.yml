description: Enforcing network-access controls is one of the defensive mechanisms
  used by cloud administrators to restrict access to a cloud instance. After the attacker
  has gained control of the console by compromising an admin account, they can
  delete a network ACL and gain access to the instance from anywhere. This search
  will query the Change datamodel to detect users deleting network ACLs.
  Deprecated because it's a duplicate
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your
  cloud provider. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by
  customizing the `cloud_network_access_control_list_deleted_filter` macro.
