how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen EC2 Instance Types"
  support search once to create a history of previously seen instance types.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an admin will create a new system using
  a new instance type never used before. Verify with the creator that they intended
  to create the system with the new instance type.
