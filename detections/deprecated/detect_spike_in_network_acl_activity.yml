description: This search will detect users creating spikes in API activity related
  to network access-control lists (ACLs)in your AWS environment. This search is deprecated
  and have been translated to use the latest Change Datamodel.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit
  your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data
  points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine.
  The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from
  the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best
  when you run the "Baseline of Network ACL Activity by ARN" support search once to
  create a lookup file of previously seen Network ACL Activity. To add or remove API
  event names related to network ACLs, edit the macro `network_acl_events`.
known_false_positives: The false-positive rate may vary based on the values of`dataPointThreshold`
  and `deviationThreshold`. Please modify this according the your environment.
