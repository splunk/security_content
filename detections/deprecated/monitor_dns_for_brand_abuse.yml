description: This search looks for DNS requests for faux domains similar to the domains
  that you want to have monitored for abuse.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(DNS.answer) as IPs min(_time)
  as firstTime from datamodel=Network_Resolution by DNS.src, DNS.query | `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `brand_abuse_dns` | `monitor_dns_for_brand_abuse_filter`'
how_to_implement: You need to ingest data from your DNS logs. Specifically you must
  ingest the domain that is being queried and the IP of the host originating the request.
  Ideally, you should also be ingesting the answer to the query and the query type.
  This approach allows you to also create your own localized passive DNS capability
  which can aid you in future investigations. You also need to have run the search
  "ESCU - DNSTwist Domain Names", which creates the permutations of the domain that
  will be checked for. You also need the [`dnstwist`](https://gist.github.com/d1vious/c4c2aae7fa7d5cbb1f24adc5f6303ac1) custom command.
