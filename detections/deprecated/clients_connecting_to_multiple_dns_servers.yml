description: This search allows you to identify the endpoints that have connected
  to more than five DNS servers and made DNS Queries over the time frame of the search.
how_to_implement: 'This search requires that DNS data is being ingested and populating
  the `Network_Resolution` data model. This data can come from DNS logs or from solutions
  that parse network traffic for this data, such as Splunk Stream or Bro.\

  This search produces fields (`dest_count`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident
  Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields
  contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add
  the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes
  (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1.
  **Label:** Distinct DNS Connections, **Field:** dest_count\

  Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be
  found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`'

known_false_positives: It's possible that an enterprise has more than five DNS servers
  that are configured in a round-robin rotation. Please customize the search, as appropriate.
