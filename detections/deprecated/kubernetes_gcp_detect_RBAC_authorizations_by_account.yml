description: This search provides information on Kubernetes RBAC authorizations by
  accounts, this search can be modified by adding top to see both extremes of RBAC
  by accounts occurrences
search: '`google_gcp_pubsub_message` data.labels.authorization.k8s.io/reason=ClusterRoleBinding
  OR Clusterrole  | table src_ip src_user data.labels.authorization.k8s.io/decision
  data.labels.authorization.k8s.io/reason | rare src_user data.labels.authorization.k8s.io/reason
  |`kubernetes_gcp_detect_rbac_authorizations_by_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on for GCP. This search works with
  pubsub messaging service logs
known_false_positives: Not all RBAC Authorications are malicious. RBAC authorizations
  can uncover malicious activity specially if sensitive Roles have been granted.
