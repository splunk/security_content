description: This search looks for ColdRoot events from the osx-attacks osquery pack.
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from your osquery deployed agents with the [osx-attacks.conf](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/blob/experimental/packs/osx-attacks.conf#L599)
  pack enabled. Also the [TA-OSquery](https://github.com/d1vious/TA-osquery) must
  be deployed across your indexers and universal forwarders in order to have the osquery
  data populate the Alerts data model
