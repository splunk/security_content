  '**DEPRECATION NOTE** - This search has been deprecated and replaced with `Okta Multiple Accounts Locked Out`.
  The following analytic utilizes the user.acount.lock event to identify
  associates who are locked out of Okta. An adversary attempting to brute force or
  password spray account names may lock accounts out depending on the threshold.'
data_source: []
search: '`okta` eventType=user.account.lock | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(displayMessage) values(src_user) as user by src_ip eventType status
  | where count >=3 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `okta_account_locked_out_filter`'
how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune Okta and tune the analytic
  to ensure proper fidelity. Modify risk score as needed. Drop to anomaly until tuning
  is complete.
