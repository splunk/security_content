description: The search looks for modifications to the hosts file on all Windows endpoints
  across your environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem  by Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path
  Filesystem.dest | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | search Filesystem.file_name=hosts AND Filesystem.file_path=*Windows\\System32\\*
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `windows_hosts_file_modification_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records the file-system activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint.Filesystem
  data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black, or by other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report file-system
  reads and writes.
known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons for system administrators to
  add entries to this file.
