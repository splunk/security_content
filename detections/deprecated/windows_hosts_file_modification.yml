description: The search looks for modifications to the hosts file on all Windows endpoints
  across your environment.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records the file-system activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint.Filesystem
  data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  products, such as Carbon Black, or by other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report file-system
  reads and writes.

known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons for system administrators to
  add entries to this file.
