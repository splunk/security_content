description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user logged into
  the AWS account, is making API calls and has not enabled Multi Factor authentication.
  Multi factor authentication adds a layer of security by forcing the users to type
  a unique authentication code from an approved authentication device when they access
  AWS websites or services. AWS Best Practices recommend that you enable MFA for privileged
  IAM users.
search: '`cloudtrail` userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated=false
  | search NOT [| inputlookup aws_service_accounts | fields identity | rename identity
  as user]| stats  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(eventName)
  as eventName by userIdentity.arn userIdentity.type user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`  |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_api_activity_from_users_without_mfa_filter`'
how_to_implement: 'You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs. Leverage the support search `Create a list of approved AWS service accounts`:
  run it once every 30 days to create a list of service accounts and validate them.\

  This search produces fields (`eventName`,`userIdentity.type`,`userIdentity.arn`)
  that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed
  when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the
  notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already
  present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management
  > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** AWS Event Name, **Field:**
  eventName\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** AWS User ARN, **Field:** userIdentity.arn\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** AWS User Type, **Field:** userIdentity.type\

  Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be
  found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`'
known_false_positives: Many service accounts configured within an AWS infrastructure
  do not have multi factor authentication enabled. Please ignore the service accounts,
  if triggered and instead add them to the aws_service_accounts.csv file to fine tune
  the detection. It is also possible that the search detects users in your environment
  using Single Sign-On systems, since the MFA is not handled by AWS.
