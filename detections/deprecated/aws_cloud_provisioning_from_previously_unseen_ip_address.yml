description: 'This search looks for AWS provisioning activities from previously unseen
  IP addresses. Provisioning activities are defined broadly as any event that begins
  with "Run" or "Create." This search is deprecated and have been translated to use the latest Change Datamodel. '
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen AWS Provisioning
  Activity Sources" support search once to create a history of previously seen locations
  that have provisioned AWS resources.

known_false_positives: "This is a strictly behavioral search, so we define \"false\
  \ positive\" slightly differently. Every time this fires, it will accurately reflect\
  \ the first occurrence in the time period you're searching within, plus what is\
  \ stored in the cache feature. But while there are really no \"false positives\"\
  \ in a traditional sense, there is definitely lots of noise.\\\n This search will\
  \ fire any time a new IP address is seen in the **GeoIP** database for any kind\
  \ of provisioning activity. If you typically do all provisioning from tools inside\
  \ of your country, there should be few false positives. If you are located in countries\
  \ where the free version of **MaxMind GeoIP** that ships by default with Splunk\
  \ has weak resolution (particularly small countries in less economically powerful\
  \ regions), this may be much less valuable to you."
