description: This search looks for processes launching netsh.exe to execute various
  commands via the netsh command-line utility. Netsh.exe is a command-line scripting
  utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify the network
  configuration of a computer that is currently running. Netsh can be used as a persistence
  proxy technique to execute a helper .dll when netsh.exe is executed. In this search,
  we are looking for processes spawned by netsh.exe that are executing commands via
  the command line. Deprecated because we have another detection of the same type.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=netsh.exe by Processes.user Processes.dest Processes.parent_process
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `processes_created_by_netsh_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting logs
  with the process name, command-line arguments, and parent processes from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: It is unusual for netsh.exe to have any child processes in
  most environments. It makes sense to investigate the child process and verify whether
  the process spawned is legitimate. We explicitely exclude "C:\Program Files\rempl\sedlauncher.exe"
  process path since it is a legitimate process by Mircosoft.
