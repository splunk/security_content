description: This search looks for processes launching netsh.exe to execute various
  commands via the netsh command-line utility. Netsh.exe is a command-line scripting
  utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify the network
  configuration of a computer that is currently running. Netsh can be used as a persistence
  proxy technique to execute a helper .dll when netsh.exe is executed. In this search,
  we are looking for processes spawned by netsh.exe that are executing commands via
  the command line. Deprecated because we have another detection of the same type.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=netsh.exe by Processes.user Processes.dest Processes.parent_process
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `processes_created_by_netsh_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is unusual for netsh.exe to have any child processes in
  most environments. It makes sense to investigate the child process and verify whether
  the process spawned is legitimate. We explicitely exclude "C:\Program Files\rempl\sedlauncher.exe"
  process path since it is a legitimate process by Mircosoft.
