description: This search show information on uploaded containers including source
  user, account, action, bucket name event name, http user agent, message and destination
  path.
how_to_implement: You must install the GCP App for Splunk (version 2.0.0 or later),
  then configure stackdriver and set a subpub subscription to be imported to Splunk.
  You must also install Cloud Infrastructure data model. Please also customize the
  `container_implant_gcp_detection_filter` macro to filter out the false positives.

known_false_positives: Uploading container is a normal behavior from developers or
  users with access to container registry. GCP GCR registers container upload as a
  Storage event, this search must be considered under the context of CONTAINER upload
  creation which automatically generates a bucket entry for destination path.
