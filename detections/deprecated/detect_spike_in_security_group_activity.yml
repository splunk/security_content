description: This search will detect users creating spikes in API activity related
  to security groups in your AWS environment.  It will also update the cache file
  that factors in the latest data.  This search is deprecated and have been translated
  to use the latest Change Datamodel.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit
  your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data
  points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine.
  The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from
  the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike.This search works best
  when you run the "Baseline of Security Group Activity by ARN" support search once
  to create a history of previously seen Security Group Activity. To add or remove
  API event names for security groups, edit the macro `security_group_api_calls`.
known_false_positives: Based on the values of`dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold`,
  the false positive rate may vary. Please modify this according the your environment.
