description: This search looks for reading loaded Images unique to credential dumping
  with Mimikatz. Deprecated because mimikatz libraries changed and very noisy sysmon
  Event Code.
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs and a sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 7 with powershell.exe. This search uses an input macro named
  `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.

known_false_positives: Other tools can import the same DLLs. These tools should be
  part of a whtelist.
