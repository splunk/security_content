search: '`okta` eventType=app.generic.unauth_app_access_attempt | stats min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(app) as Apps count by src_user, result
  ,displayMessage, src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `okta_failed_sso_attempts_filter`'

  ingested in your Splunk deployment.

  accessing apps they should have access to.
