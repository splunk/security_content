description: The search looks for the Registry Key DisableAntiSpyware set to disable.
  This is consistent with Ryuk infections across a fleet of endpoints.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the process-system activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint Processes data-model object. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.

known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature on a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
