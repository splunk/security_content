description: This search provides information on Kubernetes service accounts with
  failure or forbidden access status, this search can be extended by using top or
  rare operators to find trends or rarities in failure status, user agents, source
  IPs and request URI
search: '`aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` user.groups{}=system:serviceaccounts responseStatus.status
  = Failure | table sourceIPs{} user.username userAgent verb responseStatus.status
  requestURI | `kubernetes_aws_detect_service_accounts_forbidden_failure_access_filter`'

  search works with cloudwatch logs.
