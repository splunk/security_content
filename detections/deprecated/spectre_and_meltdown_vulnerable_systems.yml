description: The search is used to detect systems that are still vulnerable to the
  Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Vulnerabilities where Vulnerabilities.cve ="CVE-2017-5753"
  OR Vulnerabilities.cve ="CVE-2017-5715" OR Vulnerabilities.cve ="CVE-2017-5754"
  by Vulnerabilities.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Vulnerabilities)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `spectre_and_meltdown_vulnerable_systems_filter`'
how_to_implement: The search requires that you are ingesting your vulnerability-scanner
  data and that it reports the CVE of the vulnerability identified.
known_false_positives: It is possible that your vulnerability scanner is not detecting
  that the patches have been applied.
