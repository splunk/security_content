description: 'The following analytic identifites the use of Mimikatz modules attempting to perform Pass-the-Ticket, Golden or Silver Kerberos ticket attacks and Skeleton Key attack. This behavior is typically performed within interactive Mimikatz memory space, however it may be identified on the command-line.
  A Pass-the-Ticket (ptt) attack is performed once an adversary has established access to a single endpoint and retrieved the kerberos ticket to now begin moving laterally using this method. Typically, it blends in with logon activity as the ticket can be copied to another system and passed into the current session effectively simulating a logon without any communication with the Domain Controller.
  A Golden or Silver ticket attack requires some setup by the adversary, but once performed it will simulate lateral based authentication to additional endpoints.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs
  with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: None identified as this is strictly identifying known command-line attributes related to Mimikatz.
