description: This search builds a table of the first and last times seen for every
  IP address (along with its physical location) previously associated with cloud-provisioning
  activity. This is broadly defined as any event that runs or creates something.
search: '`cloudtrail` (eventName=Run* OR eventName=Create*) | iplocation sourceIPAddress
  | stats earliest(_time) as firstTime, latest(_time) as lastTime by sourceIPAddress,
  City, Region, Country | outputlookup previously_seen_provisioning_activity_src.csv
  | stats count'
