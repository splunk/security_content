description: This search detects loading of unsigned images by LSASS. Deprecated because too noisy.
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs with a sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 7 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.

search: '`sysmon` EventID=7 Image=*lsass.exe Signed=false | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, Image, ImageLoaded, Signed, SHA1
  | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `unsigned_image_loaded_by_lsass_filter` '
known_false_positives: Other tools could load images into LSASS for legitimate reason.
  But enterprise tools should always use signed DLLs.
