description: This search returns a list of hosts that have not successfully completed
  a backup in over a week. Deprecated because it's a infrastructure monitoring.
data_source: []
search: '`netbackup` MESSAGE="Disk/Partition backup completed successfully." | stats
  latest(_time) as latestTime by COMPUTERNAME | `security_content_ctime(latestTime)`
  | rename COMPUTERNAME as dest | eval isOutlier=if(latestTime <= relative_time(now(),
  "-7d@d"), 1, 0) | search isOutlier=1 | table latestTime, dest | `extended_period_without_successful_netbackup_backups_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to first obtain data
  from your backup solution, either from the backup logs on your hosts, or from a
  central server responsible for performing the backups. If you do not use Netbackup,
  you can modify this search for your backup solution. Depending on how often you
  backup your systems, you may want to modify how far in the past to look for a successful
  backup, other than the default of seven days.
