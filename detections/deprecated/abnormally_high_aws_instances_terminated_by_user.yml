  number of instances were successfully terminated by a user in a 10-minute window.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs.
known_false_positives: Many service accounts configured with your AWS infrastructure
  are known to exhibit this behavior. Please adjust the threshold values and filter
  out service accounts from the output. Always verify whether this search alerted
  on a human user.
