description: This search looks for PowerShell requesting privileges consistent with
  credential dumping. Deprecated, looks like things changed from a logging perspective.

how_to_implement: 'You must be ingesting Windows Security logs. You must also enable
  the account change auditing here: http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Data/MonitorWindowseventlogdata.
  Additionally, this search requires you to enable your Group Management Audit Logs
  in your Local Windows Security Policy and to be ingesting those logs.  More information
  on how to enable them can be found here: http://whatevernetworks.com/auditing-group-membership-changes-in-active-directory/.
  Finally, please make sure that the local administrator group name is "Administrators"
  to be able to look for the right group membership changes.'
known_false_positives: The activity may be legitimate. PowerShell is often used by
  administrators to perform various tasks, and it's possible this event could be generated
  in those cases. In these cases, false positives should be fairly obvious and you
  may need to tweak the search to eliminate noise.
