  '**DEPRECATION NOTE** - This search has been deprecated and replaced with `Okta Multiple Users Failing To Authenticate From Ip`.
  This analytic identifies multiple failed logon attempts from
  a single IP in a short period of time. Use this analytic to identify patterns of suspicious logins from a
  single source and filter as needed or use this to drive tuning for higher fidelity
  analytics.'

how_to_implement: This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being
  ingested in your Splunk deployment.
known_false_positives: A single public IP address servicing multiple legitmate users
  may trigger this search. In addition, the threshold of 5 distinct users may be too
  low for your needs. You may modify the included filter macro `multiple_okta_users_with_invalid_credentials_from_the_same_ip_filter`
  to raise the threshold or except specific IP adresses from triggering this search.
