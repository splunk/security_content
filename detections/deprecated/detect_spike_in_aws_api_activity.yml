description: This search will detect users creating spikes of API activity in your
  AWS environment.  It will also update the cache file that factors in the latest
  data. This search is deprecated and have been translated to use the latest Change
  Datamodel.

how_to_implement: 'You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit
  your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data
  points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine.
  The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from
  the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike.\

  This search produces fields (`eventName`,`numberOfApiCalls`,`uniqueApisCalled`)
  that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed
  when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the
  notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already
  present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management
  > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** AWS Event Name, **Field:**
  eventName\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** Number of API Calls, **Field:** numberOfApiCalls\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** Unique API Calls, **Field:** uniqueApisCalled\

  Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be
  found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`'
