name: Execution of File With Spaces Before Extension

author: Rico Valdez, Splunk
type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search looks for processes launched from files with at least five
  spaces in the name before the extension. This is typically done to obfuscate the
  file extension by pushing it outside of the default view.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_path)
  as process_path min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process = "*     .*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process
  Processes.process_name | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `execution_of_file_with_spaces_before_extension_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4
  of the Sysmon TA.
