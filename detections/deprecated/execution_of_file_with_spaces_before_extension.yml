name: Execution of File With Spaces Before Extension

type: TTP
description: This search looks for processes launched from files with at least five
  spaces in the name before the extension. This is typically done to obfuscate the
  file extension by pushing it outside of the default view.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_path)
  as process_path min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process = "*     .*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process
  Processes.process_name | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `execution_of_file_with_spaces_before_extension_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
