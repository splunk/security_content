description: This search gives you the hosts where a backup was attempted and then
  failed.
data_source: []
search: '`netbackup` | stats latest(_time) as latestTime by COMPUTERNAME, MESSAGE
  | search MESSAGE="An error occurred, failed to backup." | `security_content_ctime(latestTime)`
  | rename COMPUTERNAME as dest, MESSAGE as signature | table latestTime, dest, signature
  | `unsuccessful_netbackup_backups_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to obtain data from
  your backup solution, either from the backup logs on your endpoints or from a central
  server responsible for performing the backups. If you do not use Netbackup, you
  can modify this search for your specific backup solution.
