description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where an instance is started
  in a particular region in the last one hour and then compares it to a lookup file
  of previously seen regions where an instance was started
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Run the "Previously seen AWS Regions" support search only once to create
  of baseline of previously seen regions.  This search is deprecated and have been
  translated to use the latest Change Datamodel.

known_false_positives: It's possible that a user has unknowingly started an instance
  in a new region. Please verify that this activity is legitimate.
