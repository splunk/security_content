description: The search takes the DNS records and their answers results of the discovered_dns_records
  lookup and finds if any records have changed by searching DNS response from the
  Network_Resolution datamodel across the last day.
data_source: []
search: '| inputlookup discovered_dns_records | rename answer as discovered_answer
  | join domain[|tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(DNS.record_type)
  as type, values(DNS.answer) as current_answer values(DNS.src) as src from datamodel=Network_Resolution
  where DNS.message_type=RESPONSE DNS.answer!="unknown" DNS.answer!="" by DNS.query
  | rename DNS.query as query | where query!="unknown" | rex field=query "(?<domain>\w+\.\w+?)(?:$|/)"]

how_to_implement: 'To successfully implement this search you will need to ensure that
  DNS data is populating the `Network_Resolution` data model. It also requires that
  the `discover_dns_record` lookup table be populated by the included support search
  "Discover DNS record".
  
  **Splunk>Phantom Playbook Integration**
  
  If Splunk>Phantom is also configured in your environment, a Playbook called "DNS Hijack Enrichment"
  can be configured to run when any results are found by this detection search.
  The playbook takes in the DNS record changed and uses Geoip, whois, Censys and
  PassiveTotal to detect if DNS issuers changed. To use this integration, install
  the Phantom App for Splunk `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/`, add the
  correct hostname to the \"Phantom Instance\" field in the Adaptive Response Actions
  when configuring this detection search, and set the corresponding Playbook to
  active.

known_false_positives: Legitimate DNS changes can be detected in this search. Investigate,
  verify and update the list of provided current answers for the domains in question
  as appropriate.
