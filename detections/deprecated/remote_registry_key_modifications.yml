description: This search monitors for remote modifications to registry keys.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Registry.registry_key_name)
  as registry_key_name values(Registry.registry_path) as registry_path min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where  Registry.registry_path="\\\\*"  by
  Registry.dest , Registry.user | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `remote_registry_key_modifications_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must populate the `Endpoint`
  data model. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response product,
  such as Carbon Black, or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for
  this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes to the
  registry. Deprecated because I don't think the logic is right.
known_false_positives: This technique may be legitimately used by administrators to
  modify remote registries, so it's important to filter these events out.
