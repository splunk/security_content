search: '`aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` annotations.authorization.k8s.io/reason=* | table
  sourceIPs{} user.username userAgent annotations.authorization.k8s.io/reason | stats
  count by user.username annotations.authorization.k8s.io/reason | rare user.username
  annotations.authorization.k8s.io/reason |`kubernetes_aws_detect_rbac_authorization_by_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudwatch logs
