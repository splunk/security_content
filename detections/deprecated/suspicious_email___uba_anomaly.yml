how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data from email logs and have Splunk integrated
  with UBA. This anomaly is raised by a UBA detection model called  "SuspiciousEmailDetectionModel."
  Ensure that this model is enabled on your UBA instance.
known_false_positives: This detection model will alert on any sender domain that is
  seen for the first time. This could be a potential false positive. The next step
  is to investigate and add the URL to an allow list if you determine that it is a
  legitimate sender.
