description: This search looks for changes to registry values that control Windows
  file associations, executed by a process that is not typical for legitimate, routine
  changes to this area.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on registry changes that include the name of the process responsible for the changes
  from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Registry`
  nodes.
id: 1b989a0e-0129-4446-a695-f193a5b746fc
known_false_positives: There may be other processes in your environment that users
  may legitimately use to modify file associations. If this is the case and you are
  finding false positives, you can modify the search to add those processes as exceptions.
