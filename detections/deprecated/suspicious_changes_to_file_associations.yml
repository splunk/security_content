description: This search looks for changes to registry values that control Windows
  file associations, executed by a process that is not typical for legitimate, routine
  changes to this area.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There may be other processes in your environment that users
  may legitimately use to modify file associations. If this is the case and you are
  finding false positives, you can modify the search to add those processes as exceptions.
