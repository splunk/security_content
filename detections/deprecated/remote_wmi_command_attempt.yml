description: This search looks for wmic.exe being launched with parameters to operate
  on remote systems.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model. Deprecated because duplicate of Remote Process Instantiation via WMI.

known_false_positives: Administrators may use this legitimately to gather info from
  remote systems.
