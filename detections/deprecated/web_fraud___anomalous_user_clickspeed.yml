type: Anomaly
datamodel: []
description: This search is used to examine web sessions to identify those where the
  clicks are occurring too quickly for a human or are occurring with a near-perfect
  cadence (high periodicity or low standard deviation), resembling a script driven
  session.
search: '`stream_http` http_content_type=text* | rex field=cookie "form_key=(?<session_id>\w+)"
  | streamstats window=2 current=1 range(_time) as TimeDelta by session_id | where
  TimeDelta>0 |stats count stdev(TimeDelta) as ClickSpeedStdDev avg(TimeDelta) as
  ClickSpeedAvg by session_id | where count>5 AND (ClickSpeedStdDev<.5 OR ClickSpeedAvg<.5)
  | `web_fraud___anomalous_user_clickspeed_filter`'
how_to_implement: Start with a dataset that allows you to see clickstream data for
  each user click on the website. That data must have a time stamp and must contain
  a reference to the session identifier being used by the website. This ties the clicks
  together into clickstreams. This value is usually found in the http cookie. With
  a bit of tuning, a version of this search could be used in high-volume scenarios,
  such as scraping, crawling, application DDOS, credit-card testing, account takeover,
  etc. Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs, customized
  IIS, and Splunk Stream.
known_false_positives: As is common with many fraud-related searches, we are usually
  looking to attribute risk or synthesize relevant context with loosly written detections
  that simply detect anamoluous behavior.
