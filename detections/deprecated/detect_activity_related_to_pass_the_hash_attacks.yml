description: This search looks for specific authentication events from the Windows
  Security Event logs to detect potential attempts at using the Pass-the-Hash technique. This search is DEPRECATED as it is possible for event code 4624 to generate a high level of noise, as legitimate logon events may also trigger this event code. This can be especially true in environments with high levels of user activity, such as those with many concurrent logons or frequent logon attempts.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4624
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4624 (Logon_Type=3 Logon_Process=NtLmSsp NOT AccountName="ANONYMOUS LOGON") OR (Logon_Type=9 Logon_Process=seclogo) 
| fillnull 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode, Logon_Type, WorkstationName, user, dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `detect_activity_related_to_pass_the_hash_attacks_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest your Windows
  Security Event logs and leverage the latest TA for Windows.
known_false_positives: Legitimate logon activity by authorized NTLM systems may be
  detected by this search. Please investigate as appropriate.
