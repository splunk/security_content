description: This search is used to identify user accounts that share a common password.
search: '`stream_http` http_content_type=text* uri=/magento2/customer/account/loginPost*  |
  rex field=form_data "login\[username\]=(?<Username>[^&|^$]+)" | rex field=form_data
  "login\[password\]=(?<Password>[^&|^$]+)" | stats dc(Username) as UniqueUsernames
  values(Username) as user list(src_ip) as src_ip by Password|where UniqueUsernames>5
  | `web_fraud___password_sharing_across_accounts_filter`'
how_to_implement: We need to start with a dataset that allows us to see the values
  of usernames and passwords that users are submitting to the website hosting the
  Magento2 e-commerce platform (commonly found in the HTTP form_data field). A tokenized
  or hashed value of a password is acceptable and certainly preferable to a clear-text
  password. Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs,
  customized IIS, and Splunk Stream.
known_false_positives: As is common with many fraud-related searches, we are usually
  looking to attribute risk or synthesize relevant context with loosely written detections
  that simply detect anamoluous behavior.
