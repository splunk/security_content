description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user successfully terminates
  an abnormally high number of instances. This search is deprecated and have been
  translated to use the latest Change Datamodel.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. The threshold value should be tuned to your environment.
id: 1c02b86a-cd85-473e-a50b-014a9ac8fe3e
known_false_positives: Many service accounts configured within an AWS infrastructure
  are known to exhibit this behavior. Please adjust the threshold values and filter
  out service accounts from the output. Always verify if this search alerted on a
  human user.
