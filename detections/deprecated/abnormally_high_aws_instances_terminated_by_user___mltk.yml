description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user successfully terminates
  an abnormally high number of instances. This search is deprecated and have been translated to use the latest Change Datamodel.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. The threshold value should be tuned to your environment.
