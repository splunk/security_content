description: 'The search looks for the Console Window Host process (connhost.exe) executed using the force flag -ForceV1.
This is not regular behavior in the Windows OS and is often seen executed by the Ryuk Ransomware.
DEPRECATED
This event is actually seen in the windows 10 client of attack_range_local. After further testing we realized this is not specific to Ryuk.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the process-system activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint Processes data-model object. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
