description: This search looks for PowerShell processes started with a base64 encoded
  command-line passed to it, with parameters to modify the execution policy for the
  process, and those that prevent the display of an interactive prompt to the user.
  This combination of command-line options is suspicious because it overrides the
  default PowerShell execution policy, attempts to hide itself from the user, and
  passes an encoded script to be run on the command-line. Deprecated because almost
  the same as Malicious PowerShell Process - Encoded Command

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
known_false_positives: Legitimate process can have this combination of command-line
  options, but it's not common.
