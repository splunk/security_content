description: This search looks for flags passed to schtasks.exe on the command-line
  that indicate that task names related to the execution of Bad Rabbit ransomware
  were created or deleted. Deprecated because we already have a similar detection
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
