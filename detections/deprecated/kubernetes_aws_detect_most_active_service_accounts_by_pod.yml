  pods by IP address, verb and decision
search: '`aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` user.groups{}=system:serviceaccounts  objectRef.resource=pods
  | table  sourceIPs{} user.username userAgent verb annotations.authorization.k8s.io/decision  |
  top  sourceIPs{} user.username verb annotations.authorization.k8s.io/decision |`kubernetes_aws_detect_most_active_service_accounts_by_pod_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudwatch logs
known_false_positives: Not all service accounts interactions are malicious. Analyst
  must consider IP, verb and decision context when trying to detect maliciousness.
