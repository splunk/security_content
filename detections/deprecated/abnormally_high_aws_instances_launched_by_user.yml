  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. The threshold value should be tuned to your environment.

  are known to exhibit this behavior. Please adjust the threshold values and filter
  out service accounts from the output. Always verify if this search alerted on a
