how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen EC2 AMIs" support
  search once to create a history of previously seen AMIs.
known_false_positives: After a new AMI is created, the first systems created with
  that AMI will cause this alert to fire.  Verify that the AMI being used was created
  by a legitimate user.
