  '**DEPRECATION NOTE** - This search has been deprecated and replaced with `Okta Multiple Failed MFA Requests For User`.
  The following analytic identifies an account that has rejected more than
  2 Push notifications in a 10 minute window. Modify this query for your environment
  by upping the count or time window.'
data_source: []
search: '`okta` outcome.reason="User rejected Okta push verify" OR (debugContext.debugData.factor="OKTA_VERIFY_PUSH"

  a push notification") | bin _time as bin_time span=10m | eval user=coalesce(actor.alternateId,user),

  timeWindow | convert ctime(*timeWindow) ctime(firsttime) ctime(lasttime) | where
  count >= 2 | `okta_two_or_more_rejected_okta_pushes_filter`'
how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune Okta and tune the analytic
  to ensure proper fidelity. Modify risk score as needed. Drop to anomaly until tuning
  is complete.
