description: This search looks for AWS provisioning activities from previously unseen
  regions. Region in this context is similar to a state in the United States. Provisioning
  activities are defined broadly as any event that begins with "Run" or "Create." This search is deprecated and have been translated to use the latest Change Datamodel.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen AWS Provisioning
  Activity Sources" support search once to create a history of previously seen locations
  that have provisioned AWS resources.

known_false_positives: "This is a strictly behavioral search, so we define \"false\
  \ positive\" slightly differently. Every time this fires, it will accurately reflect\
  \ the first occurrence in the time period you're searching within, plus what is\
  \ stored in the cache feature. But while there are really no \"false positives\"\
  \ in a traditional sense, there is definitely lots of noise.\\\n This search will\
  \ fire any time a new region is seen in the **GeoIP** database for any kind of provisioning\
  \ activity. If you typically do all provisioning from tools inside of your region,\
  \ there should be few false positives. If you are located in regions where the free\
  \ version of **MaxMind GeoIP** that ships by default with Splunk has weak resolution\
  \ (particularly small countries in less economically powerful regions), this may\
  \ be much less valuable to you."
