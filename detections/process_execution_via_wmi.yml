description: This search looks for processes launched via WMI.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.

known_false_positives: Although unlikely, administrators may use wmi to execute commands
  for legitimate purposes.
