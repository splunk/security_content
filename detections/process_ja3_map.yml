eli5: It's difficult to get a handle on what's happening inside encrypted traffic, but it is possible to profile SSL/TLS connections. This
      query takes JA3 signatures and matches them up to process data, allowing insight into what apps are causing encrypted network traffic.
      While the combination of process + JA3 can help analysts hunt, it then provides a mechanism to find encrypted traffic that has been 
      marked as malicious or against policy.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting Bro SSL logs w/JA3 signature. Additionally you'll need
                  Carbon Black 'netconn' logs to map the process to network traffic (destination IP). If you want to use this with OSX 
                  clients, you'll need to create a KV store of MD5 -> Process Path to work around a Carbon Black agent issue.
