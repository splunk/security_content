description: This search looks for PowerShell processes launched with arguments that
  have characters indicative of obfuscation on the command-line.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.

  but it is not common.
