eli5: This search queries CloudTrail logs for events with S3 bucket access controls
  given to the "All Users" group, which allows anyone in the world access to the resource.
  This search generates a table displaying the time when the bucket was made public,
  the permission of the S3 bucket, the bucket name, and the ARN of the user who created
  the bucket.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), and then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. The threshold value should be tuned to your environment.

known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose.
  That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to the "All Users"
  group.
