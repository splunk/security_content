description: This search looks for Web requests to faux domains similar to the one
  that you want to have monitored for abuse.
how_to_implement: You need to ingest data from your web traffic. This can be accomplished
  by indexing data from a web proxy, or using a network traffic analysis tool, such
  as Bro or Splunk Stream. You also need to have run the search "ESCU - DNSTwist Domain
  Names", which creates the permutations of the domain that will be checked for.
