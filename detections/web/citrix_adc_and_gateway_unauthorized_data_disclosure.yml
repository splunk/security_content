description: The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the Citrix Bleed vulnerability
  (CVE-2023-4966), which can lead to the leaking of session tokens. It identifies
  HTTP requests with a 200 status code targeting the /oauth/idp/.well-known/openid-configuration
  URL endpoint. By parsing web traffic and filtering based on user agent details,
  HTTP method, source and destination IPs, and sourcetype, it aims to identify potentially
  malicious requests. This activity is significant for a SOC because successful exploitation
  can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users, bypass authentication, and
  access sensitive data. If confirmed malicious, it could lead to unauthorized data
  access, network propagation, and critical information exfiltration.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web
  where Web.url IN ("*/oauth/idp/.well-known/openid-configuration*")  Web.status=200
  by Web.http_user_agent, Web.status Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.url_length, Web.src,
  Web.dest, sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `citrix_adc_and_gateway_unauthorized_data_disclosure_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a
  supported Technology Add-On like Splunk for Apache, Splunk for Nginx, or Splunk
  for Palo Alto. We recommend hunting in the environment first to understand the scope
  of the issue and then deploying this detection to monitor for future exploitation
  attempts. Limit or restrict to Citrix devices only if possible.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on organization use of
  Citrix ADC and Gateway. Filter, or restrict the analytic to Citrix devices only.
