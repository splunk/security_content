name: Log4Shell JNDI Payload Injection Attempt
id: c184f12e-5c90-11ec-bf1f-497c9a704a72
version: 2

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies attempts to inject Log4Shell JNDI payloads
  via web calls. It leverages the Web datamodel and uses regex to detect patterns
  like `${jndi:ldap://` in raw web event data, including HTTP headers. This activity
  is significant because it targets vulnerabilities in Java web applications using
  Log4j, such as Apache Struts and Solr. If confirmed malicious, this could allow
  attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise.
  Immediate investigation is required to determine if the attempt was successful and
  to mitigate any potential exploitation.
data_source:
- Nginx Access
search: '| from datamodel Web.Web | regex _raw="[jJnNdDiI]{4}(\:|\%3A|\/|\%2F)\w+(\:\/\/|\%3A\%2F\%2F)(\$\{.*?\}(\.)?)?"
  | fillnull | stats count by action, category, dest, dest_port, http_content_type,
  http_method, http_referrer, http_user_agent, site, src, url, url_domain, user |
  `log4shell_jndi_payload_injection_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a
  supported Technology Add-On like Splunk for Apache or Splunk for Nginx.
known_false_positives: If there is a vulnerablility scannner looking for log4shells
  this will trigger, otherwise likely to have low false positives.
