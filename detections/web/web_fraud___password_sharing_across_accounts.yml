description: This search is used to identify user accounts that share a common password.
how_to_implement: We need to start with a dataset that allows us to see the values
  of usernames and passwords that users are submitting to the website hosting the
  Magento2 e-commerce platform (commonly found in the HTTP form_data field). A tokenized
  or hashed value of a password is acceptable and certainly preferable to a clear-text
  password. Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs,
  customized IIS, and Splunk Stream.

known_false_positives: As is common with many fraud-related searches, we are usually
  looking to attribute risk or synthesize relevant context with loosely written detections
  that simply detect anamoluous behavior.
