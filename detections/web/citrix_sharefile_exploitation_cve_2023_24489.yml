name: Citrix ShareFile Exploitation CVE-2023-24489
id: 172c59f2-5fae-45e5-8e51-94445143e93f
version: 3
date: '2024-10-17'
author: Michael Haag, Splunk
status: production
type: Hunting
data_source:
- Suricata
description: The following analytic detects potentially malicious file upload attempts
  to Citrix ShareFile via specific suspicious URLs and the HTTP POST method. It leverages
  the Web datamodel to identify URL patterns such as "/documentum/upload.aspx?parentid=",
  "/documentum/upload.aspx?filename=", and "/documentum/upload.aspx?uploadId=*", combined
  with the HTTP POST method. This activity is significant for a SOC as it may indicate
  an attempt to upload harmful scripts or content, potentially compromising the Documentum
  application. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data
  breaches, and operational disruptions.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web
  where Web.url="/documentum/upload.aspx?*" AND Web.url IN ("*parentid=*","*filename=*","*uploadId=*")
  AND Web.url IN ("*unzip=*", "*raw=*") Web.http_method=POST by Web.http_user_agent,
  Web.status Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.url_length, Web.src, Web.dest, sourcetype
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `citrix_sharefile_exploitation_cve_2023_24489_filter`'
how_to_implement: Dependent upon the placement of the ShareFile application, ensure
  the latest Technology Add-On is eneabled. This detection requires the Web datamodel
  to be populated from a supported Technology Add-On like Suricata, Splunk for Apache,
  Splunk for Nginx, or Splunk for Palo Alto. The ShareFile application is IIS based,
  therefore ingesting IIS logs and reviewing for the same pattern would identify this
  activity, successful or not.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filtering may be needed. Also,
  restricting to known web servers running IIS or ShareFile will change this from
  Hunting to TTP.
