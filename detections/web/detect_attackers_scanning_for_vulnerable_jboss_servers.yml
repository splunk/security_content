name: Detect attackers scanning for vulnerable JBoss servers

status: experimental
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies specific GET or HEAD requests to web
  servers that indicate reconnaissance attempts to find vulnerable JBoss servers.
  It leverages data from the Web data model, focusing on HTTP methods and URLs associated
  with JBoss management interfaces. This activity is significant because it often
  precedes exploitation attempts using tools like JexBoss, which can compromise the
  server. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized access, execute
  arbitrary code, or escalate privileges, leading to potential data breaches and system
  compromise.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Web where (Web.http_method="GET" OR Web.http_method="HEAD")
  AND (Web.url="*/web-console/ServerInfo.jsp*" OR Web.url="*web-console*" OR Web.url="*jmx-console*"
  OR Web.url = "*invoker*") by Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.src, Web.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_attackers_scanning_for_vulnerable_jboss_servers_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data from the web server or network traffic
  that contains web specific information, and populating the Web data model.
known_false_positives: It's possible for legitimate HTTP requests to be made to URLs
  containing the suspicious paths.
