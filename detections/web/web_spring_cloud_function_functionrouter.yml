type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies HTTP POST requests to the Spring Cloud
  Function endpoint containing "functionRouter" in the URL. It leverages the Web data
  model to detect these requests based on specific fields such as http_method, url,
  and http_user_agent. This activity is significant because it targets CVE-2022-22963,
  a known vulnerability in Spring Cloud Function, which has multiple proof-of-concept
  exploits available. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration,
  or further compromise of the affected system.
data_source:
- Splunk Stream HTTP
search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.http_method IN ("POST") Web.url="*/functionRouter*"
  by Web.http_user_agent Web.http_method, Web.url,Web.url_length Web.src, Web.dest
  Web.status sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `web_spring_cloud_function_functionrouter_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on Web traffic that include fields relavent for traffic into the `Web` datamodel.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present with legitimate applications.
  Attempt to filter by dest IP or use Asset groups to restrict to servers.
