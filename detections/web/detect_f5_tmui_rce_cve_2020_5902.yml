type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies remote code execution (RCE) attempts
  targeting F5 BIG-IP, BIG-IQ, and Traffix SDC devices, specifically exploiting CVE-2020-5902.
  It uses regex to detect patterns in syslog data that match known exploit strings
  such as "hsqldb;" and directory traversal sequences. This activity is significant
  because successful exploitation can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands
  on the affected devices, leading to full system compromise. If confirmed malicious,
  this could result in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further lateral
  movement within the network.
data_source: []
search: '`f5_bigip_rogue` | regex _raw="(hsqldb;|.*\\.\\.;.*)" | search `detect_f5_tmui_rce_cve_2020_5902_filter`'
how_to_implement: To consistently detect exploit attempts on F5 devices using the
  vulnerabilities contained within CVE-2020-5902 it is recommended to ingest logs
  via syslog.  As many BIG-IP devices will have SSL enabled on their management interfaces,
  detections via wire data may not pick anything up unless you are decrypting SSL
  traffic in order to inspect it.  I am using a regex string from a Cloudflare mitigation
  technique to try and always catch the offending string (..;), along with the other
  exploit of using (hsqldb;).
