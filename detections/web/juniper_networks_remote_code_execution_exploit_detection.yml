description: The following analytic detects attempts to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in Juniper Networks devices. It identifies requests to /webauth_operation.php?PHPRC=*, which are indicative of uploading and executing malicious PHP files. This detection leverages the Web data model, focusing on specific URL patterns and HTTP status codes. This activity is significant because it signals an attempt to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary code on the device. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could gain control over the device, leading to data theft, network compromise, or other severe consequences.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web where Web.url IN ("*/webauth_operation.php?PHPRC=*") Web.status=200 by Web.http_user_agent, Web.status Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.url_length, Web.src, Web.dest, sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `juniper_networks_remote_code_execution_exploit_detection_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this search, ensure that the Web data model is populated. The search is activated when the Web data model is accelerated. Network products, such as Suricata or Palo Alto, need to be mapped to the Web data model. Adjust the mapping as necessary to suit your specific products.
known_false_positives: Be aware of potential false positives - legitimate uses of the /webauth_operation.php endpoint may cause benign activities to be flagged.The URL in the analytic is specific to a successful attempt to exploit the vulnerability. Review contents of the HTTP body to determine if the request is malicious. If the request is benign, add the URL to the whitelist or continue to monitor.
