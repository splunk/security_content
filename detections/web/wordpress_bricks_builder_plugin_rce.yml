description: The following analytic identifies potential exploitation of the WordPress
  Bricks Builder plugin RCE vulnerability. It detects HTTP POST requests to the URL
  path "/wp-json/bricks/v1/render_element" with a status code of 200, leveraging the
  Web datamodel. This activity is significant as it indicates an attempt to exploit
  CVE-2024-25600, a known vulnerability that allows remote code execution. If confirmed
  malicious, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the target server, leading
  to potential full system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Web where Web.url IN ("*/wp-json/bricks/v1/render_element")
  Web.status=200 Web.http_method=POST by Web.src, Web.dest, Web.http_user_agent, Web.url,
  Web.uri_path, Web.status, Web.http_method, sourcetype, source | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wordpress_bricks_builder_plugin_rce_filter`'
how_to_implement: The search is based on data in the Web datamodel and was modeled
  from NGINX logs. Ensure that the Web datamodel is accelerated and that the data
  source for the Web datamodel is properly configured. If using other web sources,
  modify they query, or review the data, as needed.
known_false_positives: False positives may be possible, however we restricted it to
  HTTP Status 200 and POST requests, based on the POC. Upon investigation review the
  POST body for the actual payload - or command - being executed.
