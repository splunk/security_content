description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit the CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure. It detects GET requests to the /api/v1/totp/user-backup-code/../../system/system-information URI, which leverage an authentication bypass to access system information. The detection uses the Web datamodel to identify requests with a 200 OK response, indicating a successful exploit attempt. This activity is significant as it reveals potential unauthorized access to sensitive system information. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain critical insights into the system, facilitating further exploitation and compromise.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web where Web.url="*/api/v1/totp/user-backup-code/../../system/system-information*" Web.http_method=GET Web.status=200 by Web.src, Web.dest, Web.http_user_agent, Web.url | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ivanti_connect_secure_system_information_access_via_auth_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a supported Technology Add-On like Suricata, Splunk for Apache, Splunk for Nginx, or Splunk for Palo Alto.
known_false_positives: This analytic is limited to HTTP Status 200; adjust as necessary. False positives may occur if the URI path is IP-restricted or externally blocked. It's recommended to review the context of the alerts and adjust the analytic parameters to better fit the specific environment.
