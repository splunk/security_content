type: TTP
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit CVE-2024-27199, a critical vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity web server, allowing unauthenticated access to specific endpoints. It detects unusual access patterns to vulnerable paths such as /res/, /update/, and /.well-known/acme-challenge/ by monitoring HTTP traffic logs via Suricata. This activity is significant as it could indicate an attacker bypassing authentication to access or modify system settings. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized changes, disclosure of sensitive information, or uploading of malicious certificates, severely compromising the server's security.
search: '`suricata` http.url IN ("*../admin/diagnostic.jsp*", "*../app/https/settings/*", "*../app/pipeline*", "*../app/oauth/space/createBuild.html*", "*../res/*", "*../update/*", "*../.well-known/acme-challenge/*", "*../app/availableRunners*", "*../app/https/settings/setPort*", "*../app/https/settings/certificateInfo*", "*../app/https/settings/defaultHttpsPort*", "*../app/https/settings/fetchFromAcme*", "*../app/https/settings/removeCertificate*", "*../app/https/settings/uploadCertificate*", "*../app/https/settings/termsOfService*", "*../app/https/settings/triggerAcmeChallenge*", "*../app/https/settings/cancelAcmeChallenge*", "*../app/https/settings/getAcmeOrder*", "*../app/https/settings/setRedirectStrategy*") http.status=200 http_method=GET | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by src, dest, http_user_agent, http.url, http.status, http_method | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `jetbrains_teamcity_limited_auth_bypass_suricata_cve_2024_27199_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following detection relies on the Suricata TA and ensuring it is properly configured to monitor HTTP traffic. Modify the query for your environment and log sources as needed.
known_false_positives: False positives are not expected, however, monitor, filter, and tune as needed based on organization log sources. The analytic is restricted to 200 and GET requests to specific URI paths, which should limit false positives.
