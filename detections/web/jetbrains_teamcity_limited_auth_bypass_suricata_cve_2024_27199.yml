description: 'The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit CVE-2024-27199,
  a critical vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity web server, allowing unauthenticated
  access to specific endpoints. It detects unusual access patterns to vulnerable paths
  such as /res/, /update/, and /.well-known/acme-challenge/ by monitoring HTTP traffic
  logs via Suricata. This activity is significant as it could indicate an attacker
  bypassing authentication to access or modify system settings. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized changes, disclosure of sensitive information, or
  uploading of malicious certificates, severely compromising the server''s security.'
search: '`suricata` http.url IN ("*../admin/diagnostic.jsp*", "*../app/https/settings/*",
  "*../app/pipeline*", "*../app/oauth/space/createBuild.html*", "*../res/*", "*../update/*",
  "*../.well-known/acme-challenge/*", "*../app/availableRunners*", "*../app/https/settings/setPort*",

how_to_implement: The following detection relies on the Suricata TA and ensuring it
  is properly configured to monitor HTTP traffic. Modify the query for your environment
  and log sources as needed.
known_false_positives: False positives are not expected, however, monitor, filter,
  and tune as needed based on organization log sources. The analytic is restricted
  to 200 and GET requests to specific URI paths, which should limit false positives.
