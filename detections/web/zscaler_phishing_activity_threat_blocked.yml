description: The following analytic identifies potential phishing attempts blocked
  by Zscaler within a network. It leverages web proxy logs to detect actions tagged
  as HTML.Phish. The detection method involves analyzing critical data points such
  as user, threat name, URL, and hostname. This activity is significant for a SOC
  as it serves as an early warning system for phishing threats, enabling prompt investigation
  and mitigation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an attempt
  to deceive users into divulging sensitive information, potentially leading to data
  breaches or credential theft.
search: '`zscaler_proxy` action=blocked threatname="HTML.Phish*" | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by action deviceowner user threatname url src
  dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `zscaler_phishing_activity_threat_blocked_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Zscaler Add-on from Splunkbase.
  You must be ingesting Zscaler events into your Splunk environment through an ingester.
  This analytic was written to be used with the "zscalernss-web" sourcetype leveraging
  the Zscaler proxy data. This enables the integration with Splunk Enterprise Security.
  Security teams are encouraged to adjust the detection parameters, ensuring the detection
  is tailored to their specific environment.
known_false_positives: False positives are limited to Zscalar configuration.
