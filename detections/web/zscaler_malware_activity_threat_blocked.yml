description: The following analytic identifies potential malware activities within
  a network that are blocked by Zscaler. It leverages web proxy logs to filter for
  blocked actions associated with malware, aggregating occurrences by user, URL, and
  threat category. This detection is significant for SOC as it highlights attempts
  to access malicious content, indicating potential compromise or targeted attacks.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could signify an ongoing attempt to infiltrate
  the network, necessitating immediate investigation to prevent further threats and
  ensure network integrity.
search: '`zscaler_proxy` action=blocked threatname=*malware* threatcategory!=None
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by action deviceowner
  user urlcategory url src dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `zscaler_malware_activity_threat_blocked_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Zscaler Add-on from Splunkbase.
  You must be ingesting Zscaler events into your Splunk environment through an ingester.
  This analytic was written to be used with the "zscalernss-web" sourcetype leveraging
  the Zscaler proxy data. This enables the integration with Splunk Enterprise Security.
  Security teams are encouraged to adjust the detection parameters, ensuring the detection
  is tailored to their specific environment.
known_false_positives: False positives are limited to Zscalar configuration.
