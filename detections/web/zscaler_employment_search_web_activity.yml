description: The following analytic identifies web activity related to employment searches within a network. It leverages Zscaler web proxy logs, focusing on entries categorized as 'Job/Employment Search'. Key data points such as device owner, user, URL category, destination URL, and IP are analyzed. This detection is significant for SOCs as it helps monitor potential insider threats by identifying users who may be seeking new employment. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate a risk of data exfiltration or other insider threats, potentially leading to sensitive information leakage or other security breaches.
search: '`zscaler_proxy` urlsupercategory="Job/Employment Search" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by action deviceowner user urlcategory url src dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `zscaler_employment_search_web_activity_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Zscaler Add-on from Splunkbase. You must be ingesting Zscaler events into your Splunk environment through an ingester. This analytic was written to be used with the "zscalernss-web" sourcetype leveraging the Zscaler proxy data. This enables the integration with Splunk Enterprise Security. Security teams are encouraged to adjust the detection parameters, ensuring the detection is tailored to their specific environment.
known_false_positives: False positives are limited to Zscaler configuration.
