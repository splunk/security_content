description: "The analytic is designed to identify destinations within a network deemed as potential Empolyment Searches. Utilizing Splunk's search functionality, it processes web proxy logs, focusing on entries marked as 'Job/Employment Search'. Key data points such as device owner, user, URL category, destination URL and IP, and action taken are analyzed to enumerate the employment risk destinations. This anomaly-type detection aids in monitoring and managing risks, promoting a secure environment from insider threats."

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Zscaler Add-on from Splunkbase. You must be ingesting Zscaler events into your Splunk environment through an ingester. This analytic was written to be used with the "zscalernss-web" sourcetype leveraging the Zscaler proxy data. This enables the integration with Splunk Enterprise Security. Security teams are encouraged to adjust the detection parameters, ensuring the detection is tailored to their specific environment.
known_false_positives: False positives are limited to Zscaler configuration.
