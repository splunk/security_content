type: TTP
status: production
description: 'The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit the JetBrains
  TeamCity Authentication Bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-27198). It detects suspicious
  POST requests to the `/app/rest/users` and `/app/rest/users/id:1/tokens` endpoints,
  which are indicative of attempts to create new administrator users or generate admin
  access tokens without authentication. This detection leverages the Web datamodel
  and CIM-compliant log sources, such as Nginx or TeamCity logs. This activity is
  significant as it can lead to full control over the TeamCity server, including all
  projects, builds, agents, and artifacts. If confirmed malicious, attackers could
  gain unauthorized administrative access, leading to severe security breaches.'
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web
  where ((Web.url="*?jsp=*" AND Web.url="*;.jsp*") Web.status=200 Web.http_method=POST)
  OR (Web.url IN ("*jsp=/app/rest/users;.jsp","*?jsp=/app/rest/users;.jsp","*?jsp=.*/app/rest/users/id:*/tokens;*")
  Web.status=200 Web.http_method=POST ) by Web.src, Web.dest, Web.http_user_agent,
  Web.url, Web.status, Web.http_method, sourcetype, source | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `jetbrains_teamcity_authentication_bypass_cve_2024_27198_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection relies on the Web datamodel and a CIM compliant log
  source, that may include Nginx, TeamCity logs, or other web server logs.
known_false_positives: False positives are not expected, as this detection is based
  on the presence of specific URI paths and HTTP methods that are indicative of the
  CVE-2024-27198 vulnerability exploitation. Monitor, filter and tune as needed based
  on organization log sources.
