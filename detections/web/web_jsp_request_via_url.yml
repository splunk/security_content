type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies URL requests associated with CVE-2022-22965
  (Spring4Shell) exploitation attempts, specifically targeting webshell access on
  a remote webserver. It detects HTTP GET requests with URLs containing ".jsp?cmd="
  or "j&cmd=" patterns. This activity is significant as it indicates potential webshell
  deployment, which can lead to unauthorized remote command execution. If confirmed
  malicious, attackers could gain control over the webserver, execute arbitrary commands,
  and potentially escalate privileges, leading to severe data breaches and system
  compromise.
data_source:
- Nginx Access
search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.http_method IN ("GET") Web.url
  IN ("*.jsp?cmd=*","*j&cmd=*") by Web.http_user_agent Web.http_method, Web.url,Web.url_length
  Web.src, Web.dest sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `web_jsp_request_via_url_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on Web traffic that include fields relavent for traffic into the `Web` datamodel.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present with legitimate applications.
  Attempt to filter by dest IP or use Asset groups to restrict to servers.
