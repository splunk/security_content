datamodel:
- Web
description: The following analytic identifies the common URL requests used by a recent
  CVE - CVE-2022-22965, or Spring4Shell, to access a webshell on the remote webserver.
  The filename and cmd are arbitrary in this exploitation. Java will write a JSP to
  disk and a process will spawn from Java based on the cmd passed. This is indicative
  of typical web shell activity.
search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.http_method IN ("GET") Web.url
  IN ("*.jsp?cmd=*","*j&cmd=*") by Web.http_user_agent Web.http_method, Web.url,Web.url_length
  Web.src, Web.dest sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `web_jsp_request_via_url_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on Web traffic that include fields relavent for traffic into the `Web` datamodel.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present with legitimate applications.
  Attempt to filter by dest IP or use Asset groups to restrict to servers.
