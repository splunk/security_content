type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies web requests to domains that closely
  resemble your monitored brand's domain, indicating potential brand abuse. It leverages
  data from web traffic sources, such as web proxies or network traffic analysis tools,
  and cross-references these with known domain permutations generated by the "ESCU
  - DNSTwist Domain Names" search. This activity is significant as it can indicate
  phishing attempts or other malicious activities targeting your brand. If confirmed
  malicious, attackers could deceive users, steal credentials, or distribute malware,
  leading to significant reputational and financial damage.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Web.url) as urls min(_time)
  as firstTime from datamodel=Web by Web.src | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `brand_abuse_web` | `monitor_web_traffic_for_brand_abuse_filter`'
how_to_implement: You need to ingest data from your web traffic. This can be accomplished
  by indexing data from a web proxy, or using a network traffic analysis tool, such
  as Bro or Splunk Stream. You also need to have run the search "ESCU - DNSTwist Domain
  Names", which creates the permutations of the domain that will be checked for.
