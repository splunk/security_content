type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies web requests to domains that closely resemble your monitored brand's domain, indicating potential brand abuse. It leverages data from web traffic sources, such as web proxies or network traffic analysis tools, and cross-references these with known domain permutations generated by the "ESCU - DNSTwist Domain Names" search. This activity is significant as it can indicate phishing attempts or other malicious activities targeting your brand. If confirmed malicious, attackers could deceive users, steal credentials, or distribute malware, leading to significant reputational and financial damage.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Web.url) as urls min(_time) as firstTime from datamodel=Web by Web.src | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `brand_abuse_web` | `monitor_web_traffic_for_brand_abuse_filter`'
how_to_implement: You need to ingest data from your web traffic. This can be accomplished by indexing data from a web proxy, or using a network traffic analysis tool, such as Bro or Splunk Stream. You also need to have run the search "ESCU - DNSTwist Domain Names", which creates the permutations of the domain that will be checked for.
