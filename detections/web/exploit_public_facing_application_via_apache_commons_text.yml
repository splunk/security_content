description: The following analytic identifies activity related to Text4Shell, or
  the critical vulnerability CVE-2022-42889 in Apache Commons Text Library. Apache
  Commons Text versions 1.5 through 1.9 are affected, but it has been patched in version
  1.10. The analytic may need to be tuned for your environment before enabling as
  a TTP, or direct Notable. Apache Commons Text is a Java library described as a library
  focused on algorithms working on strings. We can see it as a general-purpose text
  manipulation toolkit. This vulnerability affects the StringSubstitutor interpolator
  class, which is included in the Commons Text library. A default interpolator allows
  for string lookups that can lead to Remote Code Execution. This is due to a logic
  flaw that makes the script, dns, and url lookup keys interpolated by default, as
  opposed to what it should be, according to the documentation of the StringLookupFactory
  class. Those keys allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via lookups.

how_to_implement: To implement, one must be collecting network traffic that is normalized
  in CIM and able to be queried via the Web datamodel. Or, take the chunks out needed
  and tie to a specific network source type to hunt in. Tune as needed, or remove
  the other_lookups statement.
known_false_positives: False positives are present when the values are set to 1 for
  utf and lookup. It's possible to raise this to TTP (direct notable) if removal of
  other_lookups occur and Score is raised to 2 (down from 4).
