description: The following analytic detects potential exploitation attempts against
  VMWare vRealize Network Insight, specifically targeting the CVE-2023-20887 vulnerability.
  It monitors web traffic for HTTP POST requests directed at the vulnerable endpoint
  "/saas./resttosaasservlet." This detection leverages web traffic data, focusing
  on specific URL patterns and HTTP methods. Identifying this behavior is crucial
  for a SOC as it indicates an active exploit attempt. If confirmed malicious, the
  attacker could execute arbitrary code, leading to unauthorized access, data theft,
  or further network compromise.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web
  where Web.url IN ("*/saas./resttosaasservlet*")  Web.http_method=POST Web.status
  IN ("unknown", "200") by Web.http_user_agent, Web.status Web.http_method, Web.url,
  Web.url_length, Web.src, Web.dest, sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `vmware_aria_operations_exploit_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  web or proxy logs, or ensure it is being filled by a proxy like device, into the
  Web Datamodel. Restrict to specific dest assets to reduce false positives.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on gateways in use, modify
  the status field as needed.
