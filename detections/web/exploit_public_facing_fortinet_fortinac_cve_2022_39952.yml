name: Exploit Public-Facing Fortinet FortiNAC CVE-2022-39952
id: 2038f5c6-5aba-4221-8ae2-ca76e2ca8b97
version: 2
date: '2024-05-09'
author: Michael Haag, Splunk
status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the Fortinet FortiNAC
  CVE-2022-39952 vulnerability. It identifies HTTP POST requests to the URI configWizard/keyUpload.jsp
  with a payload.zip file. The detection leverages the Web datamodel, analyzing fields
  such as URL, HTTP method, and user agent. This activity is significant as it indicates
  an attempt to exploit a known vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code
  execution. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain control over the affected
  system, schedule malicious tasks, and establish persistent access via a remote command
  and control (C2) server.
data_source:
- Palo Alto Network Threat
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web
  where Web.url IN ("*configWizard/keyUpload.jsp*") by Web.http_user_agent, Web.status
  Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.url_length, Web.src, Web.dest, sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `exploit_public_facing_fortinet_fortinac_cve_2022_39952_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a
  supported Technology Add-On like Splunk for Apache, Splunk for Nginx, or Splunk
  for Palo Alto.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Modify the query as needed
  to POST, or add additional filtering (based on log source).
