description: The following analytic detects potential exploitation of the Adobe ColdFusion vulnerability, CVE-2023-26360, which allows unauthenticated arbitrary file read. It monitors web requests to the "/cf_scripts/scripts/ajax/ckeditor/*" path using the Web datamodel, focusing on specific ColdFusion paths to differentiate malicious activity from normal traffic. This activity is significant due to the vulnerability's high CVSS score of 9.8, indicating severe risk. If confirmed malicious, it could lead to unauthorized data access, further attacks, or severe operational disruptions, necessitating immediate investigation.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web where Web.url IN ("/cf_scripts/scripts/ajax/ckeditor/*") Web.status=200 by Web.http_user_agent, Web.status Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.url_length, Web.src, Web.dest, sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `adobe_coldfusion_unauthenticated_arbitrary_file_read_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a supported Technology Add-On like Splunk for Apache, Splunk for Nginx, or Splunk for Palo Alto.
known_false_positives: 'In the wild, we have observed three different types of attempts that could potentially trigger false positives if the HTTP status code is not in the query. Please check this github gist for the specific URIs : https://gist.github.com/patel-bhavin/d10830f3f375a2397233f6a4fe38d5c9 . These could be legitimate requests depending on the context of your organization. Therefore, it is recommended to modify the analytic as needed to suit your specific environment.'
