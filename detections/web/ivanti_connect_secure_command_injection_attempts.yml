description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit the CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure. It detects POST requests to specific URIs that leverage command injection to execute arbitrary commands. The detection uses the Web datamodel to monitor for these requests and checks for a 200 OK response, indicating a successful exploit attempt. This activity is significant as it can lead to unauthorized command execution on the server. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain control over the system, leading to potential data breaches or further network compromise.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web where Web.url IN("*/api/v1/totp/user-backup-code/../../system/maintenance/archiving/cloud-server-test-connection*","*/api/v1/totp/user-backup-code/../../license/keys-status/*") Web.http_method IN ("POST", "GET") Web.status=200 by Web.src, Web.dest, Web.http_user_agent, Web.url, Web.http_method, Web.status | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ivanti_connect_secure_command_injection_attempts_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a supported Technology Add-On like Suricata, Splunk for Apache, Splunk for Nginx, or Splunk for Palo Alto.
known_false_positives: This analytic is limited to HTTP Status 200; adjust as necessary. False positives may occur if the URI path is IP-restricted or externally blocked. It's recommended to review the context of the alerts and adjust the analytic parameters to better fit the specific environment.
