description: The following analytic identifies potential adware activity blocked by
  Zscaler. It leverages web proxy logs to detect blocked actions associated with adware
  threats. Key data points such as device owner, user, URL category, destination URL,
  and IP are analyzed. This activity is significant as adware can degrade system performance,
  lead to unwanted advertisements, and potentially expose users to further malicious
  content. If confirmed malicious, it could indicate an attempt to compromise user
  systems, necessitating further investigation and remediation to prevent potential
  data breaches or system exploitation.
search: '`zscaler_proxy` action=blocked threatname=*adware* | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  by action deviceowner user urlcategory url
  src dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `zscaler_adware_activities_threat_blocked_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Zscaler Add-on from Splunkbase.
  You must be ingesting Zscaler events into your Splunk environment through an ingester.
  This analytic was written to be used with the "zscalernss-web" sourcetype leveraging
  the Zscaler proxy data. This enables the integration with Splunk Enterprise Security.
  Security teams are encouraged to adjust the detection parameters, ensuring the detection
  is tailored to their specific environment.
known_false_positives: False positives are limited to Zscaler configuration.
