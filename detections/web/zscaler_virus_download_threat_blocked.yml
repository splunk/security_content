description: The following analytic identifies attempts to download viruses that were
  blocked by Zscaler within a network. It leverages web proxy logs to detect blocked
  actions indicative of virus download attempts. Key data points such as device owner,
  user, URL category, destination URL, and IP are analyzed. This activity is significant
  as it helps in early detection and remediation of potential virus threats, enhancing
  network security. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an attempt
  to compromise the network, potentially leading to data breaches or further malware
  infections.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Zscaler Add-on from Splunkbase.
  You must be ingesting Zscaler events into your Splunk environment through an ingester.
  This analytic was written to be used with the "zscalernss-web" sourcetype leveraging
  the Zscaler proxy data. This enables the integration with Splunk Enterprise Security.
  Security teams are encouraged to adjust the detection parameters, ensuring the detection
  is tailored to their specific environment.
known_false_positives: False positives are limited to Zscaler configuration.
