description: The following hunting analytic identifies the server side template injection
  related to CVE-2022-22954, however is a variation found within the same endpoint
  of the URL scheme.
data_source: 
- Palo Alto Network Threat
search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.http_method IN ("GET") Web.url="*deviceudid=*"
  AND Web.url IN ("*java.lang.ProcessBuilder*","*freemarker.template.utility.ObjectConstructor*")
  by Web.http_user_agent Web.http_method, Web.url,Web.url_length Web.src, Web.dest
  sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `vmware_server_side_template_injection_hunt_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  web or proxy logs, or ensure it is being filled by a proxy like device, into the
  Web Datamodel. For additional filtering, allow list private IP space or restrict
  by known good.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the activity is blocked or
  was not successful. Filter known vulnerablity scanners. Filter as needed.
