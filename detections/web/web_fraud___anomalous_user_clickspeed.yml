description: This search is used to examine web sessions to identify those where the
  clicks are occurring too quickly for a human or are occurring with a near-perfect
  cadence (high periodicity or low standard deviation), resembling a script driven
  session.
how_to_implement: Start with a dataset that allows you to see clickstream data for
  each user click on the website. That data must have a time stamp and must contain
  a reference to the session identifier being used by the website. This ties the clicks
  together into clickstreams. This value is usually found in the http cookie. With
  a bit of tuning, a version of this search could be used in high-volume scenarios,
  such as scraping, crawling, application DDOS, credit-card testing, account takeover,
  etc. Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs, customized
  IIS, and Splunk Stream.

known_false_positives: As is common with many fraud-related searches, we are usually
  looking to attribute risk or synthesize relevant context with loosly written detections
  that simply detect anamoluous behavior.
