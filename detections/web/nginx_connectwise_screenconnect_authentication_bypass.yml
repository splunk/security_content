description: The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the ConnectWise ScreenConnect
  CVE-2024-1709 vulnerability, which allows attackers to bypass authentication via
  alternate paths or channels. It leverages Nginx access logs to identify web requests
  to the SetupWizard.aspx page, indicating potential exploitation. This activity is
  significant as it can lead to unauthorized administrative access and remote code
  execution. If confirmed malicious, attackers could create administrative users and
  gain full control over the affected ScreenConnect instance, posing severe security
  risks. Immediate remediation by updating to version 23.9.8 or above is recommended.
search: '`nginx_access_logs` uri_path IN ("*/SetupWizard.aspx/*","*/SetupWizard/")
  status=200 http_method=POST  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by src, dest, http_user_agent, url, uri_path, status, http_method, sourcetype,
  source | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `nginx_connectwise_screenconnect_authentication_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, ensure proper logging is occurring with
  Nginx, access.log and error.log, and that these logs are being ingested into Splunk.
  STRT utilizes this nginx.conf https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/26f59108b04da8f1d870c9cc3a3c8eec
  to properly log as much data with Nginx.
known_false_positives: False positives are not expected, as the detection is based
  on the presence of web requests to the SetupWizard.aspx page, which is not a common
  page to be accessed by legitimate users. Note that the analytic is limited to HTTP
  POST and a status of 200 to reduce false positives. Modify the query as needed to
  reduce false positives or hunt for additional indicators of compromise.
