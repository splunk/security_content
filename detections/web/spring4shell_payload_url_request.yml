- Web
description: The following analytic is static indicators related to CVE-2022-22963,
  Spring4Shell. The 3 indicators provide an amount of fidelity that source IP is attemping
  to exploit a web shell on the destination. The filename and cmd are arbitrary in
  this exploitation. Java will write a JSP to disk and a process will spawn from Java
  based on the cmd passed. This is indicative of typical web shell activity.
search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.http_method IN ("GET") Web.url
  IN ("*tomcatwar.jsp*","*poc.jsp*","*shell.jsp*") by Web.http_user_agent Web.http_method,
  Web.url,Web.url_length Web.src, Web.dest sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `spring4shell_payload_url_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on Web traffic that include fields relavent for traffic into the `Web` datamodel.
known_false_positives: The jsp file names are static names used in current proof of
  concept code. =
