description: The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the CVE-2023-46747
  vulnerability, an authentication bypass flaw in F5 BIG-IP's Configuration utility
  (TMUI). It identifies this activity by monitoring for specific URI paths such as
  "*/mgmt/tm/auth/user/*" with the PATCH method and a 200 status code. This behavior
  is significant for a SOC as it indicates potential unauthorized access attempts,
  leading to remote code execution. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain
  unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, steal data, disrupt systems, or conduct
  further malicious activities within the network.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web
  where Web.url IN ("*/mgmt/tm/auth/user/*") Web.http_method=PATCH Web.status=200
  by Web.http_user_agent, Web.status Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.url_length, Web.src,
  Web.dest, sourcetype | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `f5_tmui_authentication_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on Web traffic that include fields relevant for traffic into the `Web` datamodel.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited to as this is strict to active
  exploitation. Reduce noise by filtering to F5 devices with TMUI enabled or filter
  data as needed.
