description: This search looks for newly created accounts that have been elevated
  to local administrators.
how_to_implement: 'You must be ingesting Windows Security logs. You must also enable
  the account change auditing here:http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Data/MonitorWindowseventlogdata.
  Additionally, this search requires you to enable your Group Management Audit Logs
  in your Local Windows Security Policy and to be ingesting those logs.  More information
  on how to enable them can be found here: http://whatevernetworks.com/auditing-group-membership-changes-in-active-directory/.
  Finally, please make sure that the local administrator group name is "Administrators"
  to be able to look for the right group membership changes.\

  This search produces fields (`Security_ID`,`Group_Name`,`Message`) that are not
  yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable
  event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see
  the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident
  Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings
  > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** Security ID, **Field:** Security_ID\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** Group Name, **Field:** Group_Name\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** Message, **Field:** Message\

  Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be
  found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`'

known_false_positives: The activity may be legitimate. For this reason, it's best
  to verify the account with an administrator and ask whether there was a valid service
  request for the account creation. If your local administrator group name is not
  "Administrators", this search may generate an excessive number of false positives
