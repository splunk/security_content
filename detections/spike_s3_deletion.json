The <code>dataPointThreshold</code> variable is the minimum number of data points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine. The <code>deviationThreshold</code> variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best when you run the \"Baseline of S3 Bucket deletion activity by ARN\" support search once to create a baseline of previously seen S3 bucket-deletion activity.",
