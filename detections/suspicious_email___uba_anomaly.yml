description: This detection looks for emails that are suspicious because of their
  sender, domain rareness, or behavior differences. This is an anomaly generated by
  Splunk User Behavior Analytics (UBA).
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data from email logs and have Splunk integrated
  with UBA. This anomaly is raised by a UBA detection model called  "SuspiciousEmailDetectionModel."
  Ensure that this model is enabled on your UBA instance.

known_false_positives: This detection model will alert on any sender domain that is
  seen for the first time. This could be a potential false positive. The next step
  is to investigate and whitelist the URL if you determine that it is a legitimate
  sender.
