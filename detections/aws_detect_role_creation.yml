description: "This search provides detection of role creation by IAM users. Role creation is an event by itself if user is creating a new role with trust policies different than the available in AWS and it can be used for lateral movement and escalation of privileges."
how_to_implement: "You must install splunk AWS add-on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with cloudwatch logs"

known_false_positives: "CreateRole is not very common in common users. This search can be adjusted to provide specific values to identify cases of abuse. In general AWS provides plenty of trust policies that fit most use cases."
