description: This search looks for executions of cmd.exe spawned by a process that
  is often abused by attackers and that does not typically launch cmd.exe.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts and populates the Endpoint data model with the resultant dataset. This search
  includes a lookup file, `prohibited_apps_launching_cmd.csv`, that contains a list
  of processes that should not be spawning cmd.exe. You can modify this lookup to
  better suit your environment.

known_false_positives: There are circumstances where an application may legitimately
  execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface. Investigate and modify
  the lookup file, as appropriate.
