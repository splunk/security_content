  "eli5": "This search and its corresponding subsearch run through a series of steps, as per the following: \n\n1. Retrieves all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls.\n\n1. Kicks off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out the ARN into a more friendly format.\n\n1. Counts the number of API calls per ARN.\n\n1. Loads the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\n\n1. Drops the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merges the rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \n\n1. Renames `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\n\n1. Calculates the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting the past much more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation--weighting the past more heavily than the current.\n\n1. Updates the cache file with the latest results.\n\n1. Sets the minimum threshold for the number of data points and sets the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\n\n1. Makes a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\n\n1. Filters out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of all the API calls, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for each of these ARNs. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.",

  "how_to_implement": "You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine. The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike.\n\nThis search produces fields (`eventName`,`numberOfApiCalls`,`uniqueApisCalled`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\n\n\n\n1. **Label:** AWS Event Name, **Field:** eventName\n\n1. \n\n1. **Label:** Number of API Calls, **Field:** numberOfApiCalls\n\n1. \n\n1. **Label:** Unique API Calls, **Field:** uniqueApisCalled\n\nDetailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`",
