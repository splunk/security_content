description: The following analytic identifies potential "MFA fatigue" attacks targeting Office 365 users by detecting more than nine Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) prompts within a 10-minute timeframe. It leverages O365 management activity logs, focusing on Azure Active Directory events with the UserLoginFailed operation, a Success ResultStatus, and an ErrorNumber of 500121. This activity is significant as attackers may exploit MFA fatigue to gain unauthorized access by overwhelming users with repeated MFA requests. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data access, or further compromise within the O365 environment. Immediate investigation is crucial.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication or application issues. Filter as needed.
