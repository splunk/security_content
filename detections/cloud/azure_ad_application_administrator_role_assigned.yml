description: The following analytic identifies the assignment of the Application Administrator role to an Azure AD user. Users in this role can create and manage all 
  aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. This role also grants the ability to manage application credentials.
  Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the applications identity. If the applications identity has 
  been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while
  impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the applications identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments.
  Red teams and adversaries alike may abuse this role to escalate their privileges in an Azure AD tenant.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Auditlog log category
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the Application Administrator
  role to a user. Filter as needed.
