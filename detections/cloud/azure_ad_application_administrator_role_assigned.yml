- Azure Active Directory Add member to role
description: The following analytic identifies the assignment of the Application Administrator
  role to an Azure AD user. It leverages Azure Active Directory events, specifically
  monitoring the "Add member to role" operation. This activity is significant because
  users in this role can manage all aspects of enterprise applications, including
  credentials, which can be used to impersonate application identities. If confirmed
  malicious, an attacker could escalate privileges, manage application settings, and
  potentially access sensitive resources by impersonating application identities,
  posing a significant security risk to the Azure AD tenant.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the Auditlog log category
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the Application Administrator
  role to a user. Filter as needed.
