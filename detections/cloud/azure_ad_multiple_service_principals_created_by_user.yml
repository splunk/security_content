- Azure Active Directory Add service principal
type: Anomaly
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies instances where a single user creates
  more than three unique OAuth applications within a 10-minute timeframe in Azure
  AD. It detects this activity by monitoring the 'Add service principal' operation
  and aggregating data in 10-minute intervals. This behavior is significant as it
  may indicate an adversary rapidly creating multiple service principals to stage
  an attack or expand their foothold within the network. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could allow attackers to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or
  access sensitive information within the Azure environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Certain users or applications may create multiple service principals
  in a short period of time for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
