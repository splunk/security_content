description: The following analytic detects the assignment of an Azure AD Privileged
  Identity Management (PIM) role. It leverages Azure Active Directory events to identify
  when a user is added as an eligible member to a PIM role. This activity is significant
  because PIM roles grant elevated privileges, and their assignment should be closely
  monitored to prevent unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could
  exploit this to gain privileged access, potentially leading to unauthorized actions,
  data breaches, or further compromise of the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: As part of legitimate administrative behavior, users may be
  assigned PIM roles. Filter as needed
