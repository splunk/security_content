- Azure Active Directory Consent to application
description: The following analytic identifies instances where admin consent is granted to an application within an Azure AD tenant. It leverages Azure AD audit logs, specifically events related to the admin consent action within the ApplicationManagement category. The admin consent action allows applications to access data across the entire tenant, potentially encompassing a vast amount of organizational data. Given its broad scope and the sensitivity of some permissions that can only be granted via admin consent, it's crucial to monitor this action. Unauthorized or inadvertent granting of admin consent can lead to significant security risks, including data breaches, unauthorized data access, and potential compliance violations. If an attacker successfully tricks an administrator into granting admin consent to a malicious or compromised application, they can gain extensive and persistent access to organizational data. This can lead to data exfiltration, espionage, further malicious activities within the tenant, and potential breaches of compliance regulations

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Auditlogs log category.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may be granted tenant wide consent, filter as needed.
