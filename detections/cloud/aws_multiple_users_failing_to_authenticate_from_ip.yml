- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate into the AWS Console with 30 unique valid users within 5 minutes. This behavior could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an AWS environment tenant to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. 
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure | bucket span=5m _time | stats  dc(user_name) AS unique_accounts values(user_name) as tried_accounts by _time, src_ip, eventName, action, user_agent 
|  where unique_accounts > 30 |`aws_unusual_number_of_failed_authentications_from_ip_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-on for AWS in order to ingest Cloudtrail. We recommend the users to try different combinations of the bucket span time and the tried account threshold to tune this search according to their environment.
known_false_positives: No known false postives for this detection. Please review this alert
