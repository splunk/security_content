type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate
  into the AWS Console with 30 unique valid users within 10 minutes. This behavior
  could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an AWS
  environment tenant to obtain initial access or elevate privileges.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats  dc(user_name) AS unique_accounts values(user_name) as tried_accounts by _time,
  src_ip |`aws_unusual_number_of_failed_authentications_from_ip_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-on for AWS in order to ingest Cloudtrail.
  We recommend the users to try different combinations of the bucket span time and
  the tried account threshold to tune this search according to their environment.
known_false_positives: No known false postives for this detection. Please review this
  alert
