description: The following analytic identifies unusual modifications to security groups
  in your cloud environment by users, focusing on actions such as modifications, deletions,
  or creations over 30-minute intervals. It leverages cloud infrastructure logs and
  calculates the standard deviation for each user, using the 3-sigma rule to detect
  anomalies. This activity is significant as it may indicate a compromised account
  or insider threat. If confirmed malicious, attackers could alter security group
  configurations, potentially exposing sensitive resources or disrupting services.
search: '| tstats dc(All_Changes.object) as unique_security_groups values(All_Changes.src)
  as src values(All_Changes.user_type) as user_type values(All_Changes.object_category)
  as object_category values(All_Changes.object) as objects values(All_Changes.action)
  as action  values(All_Changes.user_agent) as user_agent values(All_Changes.command)
  as command from datamodel=Change WHERE All_Changes.object_category = "security_group"
  (All_Changes.action = modified OR All_Changes.action = deleted OR All_Changes.action
  = created)  by All_Changes.user  _time span=30m |  `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")`
  | eventstats avg(unique_security_groups) as avg_changes , stdev(unique_security_groups)
  as std_changes by user | eval upperBound=(avg_changes+std_changes*3) | eval isOutlier=if(unique_security_groups
  > 2 and unique_security_groups >= upperBound, 1, 0) | where isOutlier=1| `cloud_security_groups_modifications_by_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requries the Cloud infrastructure logs such as AWS Cloudtrail,
  GCP Pubsub Message logs, Azure Audit logs to be ingested into an accelerated Change
  datamodel. It is also recommended that users can try different combinations of the
  `bucket` span time and outlier conditions to better suit with their environment.
known_false_positives: It is possible that legitimate user/admin may modify a number
  of security groups
