description: The following analytic monitors for the creation of new mail flow rules in Office 365 that could potentially redirect or copy emails to unauthorized or external addresses. This analytic works by querying the Office 365 Management Activity logs for any operation tagged as "New-TransportRule". It specifically looks for parameters indicative of mail forwarding actions, such as "BlindCopyTo", "CopyTo", and "RedirectMessageTo". If any of these parameters are present, indicating that a forwarding rule has been set up, the detection then captures the details of this rule, including the user ID responsible for the creation, the name of the rule, the forwarding target, and the timestamps of the rule's creation and last modification.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Forwarding mail flow rules may be created for legitimate reasons, filter as needed.
