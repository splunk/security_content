description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user has set a default
  policy versions. Attackers have been know to use this technique for Privilege Escalation
  in case the previous versions of the policy had permissions to access more resources
  than the current version of the policy
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail SetDefaultPolicyVersion
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=SetDefaultPolicyVersion eventSource = iam.amazonaws.com
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.policyArn)
  as policy_arn by src requestParameters.versionId eventName eventSource aws_account_id
  errorCode userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_setdefaultpolicyversion_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately set a default policy to allow a user to access
  all resources. That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to
  all AWS resources
