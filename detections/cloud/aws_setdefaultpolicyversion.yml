description: The following analytic detects when a user sets a default policy version
  in AWS. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify the `SetDefaultPolicyVersion`
  event from the IAM service. This activity is significant because attackers may exploit
  this technique for privilege escalation, especially if previous policy versions
  grant more extensive permissions than the current one. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow an attacker to gain elevated access to AWS resources, potentially leading
  to unauthorized actions and data breaches.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail SetDefaultPolicyVersion
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=SetDefaultPolicyVersion eventSource = iam.amazonaws.com
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.policyArn)
  as policy_arn by src requestParameters.versionId eventName eventSource aws_account_id
  errorCode userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_setdefaultpolicyversion_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately set a default policy to allow a user to access
  all resources. That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to
  all AWS resources
