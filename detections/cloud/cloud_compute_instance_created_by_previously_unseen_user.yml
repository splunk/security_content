how_to_implement: You must be ingesting the appropriate cloud-infrastructure logs
  Run the "Previously Seen Cloud Compute Creations By User" support search to create
  of baseline of previously seen users.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a user will start to create compute instances
  for the first time, for any number of reasons. Verify with the user launching instances
  that this is the intended behavior.
