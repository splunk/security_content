description: The following analytic detects potential distributed password spraying
  attacks in an Azure AD environment. It identifies a spike in failed authentication
  attempts across various user-and-IP combinations from multiple source IPs and countries,
  using different user agents. This detection leverages Azure AD SignInLogs, focusing
  on error code 50126 for failed authentications. This activity is significant as
  it indicates an adversary's attempt to bypass security controls by distributing
  login attempts. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access,
  data breaches, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within the organization's
  infrastructure.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category. The thresholds set within the
  analytic (such as unique IPs, unique users, etc.) are initial guidelines and should
  be customized based on the organization's user behavior and risk profile. Security
  teams are encouraged to adjust these thresholds to optimize the balance between
  detecting genuine threats and minimizing false positives, ensuring the detection
  is tailored to their specific environment.
known_false_positives: This detection may yield false positives in scenarios where
  legitimate bulk sign-in activities occur, such as during company-wide system updates
  or when users are accessing resources from varying locations in a short time frame,
  such as in the case of VPNs or cloud services that rotate IP addresses. Filter as
  needed.
