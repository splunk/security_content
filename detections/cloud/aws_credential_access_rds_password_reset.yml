description: The following analytic detects the resetting of the master user password for an Amazon RDS DB instance. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify events where the `ModifyDBInstance` API call includes a new `masterUserPassword` parameter. This activity is significant because unauthorized password resets can grant attackers access to sensitive data stored in production databases, such as credit card information, PII, and healthcare data. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. Immediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of the password reset.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ModifyDBInstance
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource="rds.amazonaws.com" eventName=ModifyDBInstance "requestParameters.masterUserPassword"=* | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.dBInstanceIdentifier) as database_id by src awsRegion eventName userAgent user_arn| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_credential_access_rds_password_reset_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: Users may genuinely reset the RDS password.
