description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events from AWS Elastic Container
  Service (ECR). A upload of a new container is normally done from only a few known
  users. When the user was never seen before, we should have a closer look into the
  event.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource=ecr.amazonaws.com eventName=PutImage NOT `aws_ecr_users`
  | rename requestParameters.* as * | rename repositoryName AS image | eval phase="release"
  | eval severity="high" | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by
  awsRegion, eventName, eventSource, user, userName, src_ip, imageTag, registryId,
  image, phase, severity | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `aws_ecr_container_upload_unknown_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
