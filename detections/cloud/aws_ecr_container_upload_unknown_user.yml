description: The following analytic detects the upload of a new container image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) by an unknown user. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify `PutImage` events from the ECR service, filtering out known users. This activity is significant because container uploads should typically be performed by a limited set of authorized users. If confirmed malicious, this could indicate unauthorized access, potentially leading to the deployment of malicious containers, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail PutImage

how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
