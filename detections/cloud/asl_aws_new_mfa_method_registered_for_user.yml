description: The following analytic detects when a new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method is registered for an AWS account, as logged 
  through Amazon Security Lake (ASL). This behavior is detected by monitoring ASL logs for specific API calls associated with MFA registration. 
  Identifying this activity is crucial for a Security Operations Center (SOC) because unauthorized registration of a new MFA method can indicate 
  an adversary's attempt to establish or maintain access to a compromised account. The impact of such an attack is significant as it can enable 
  persistent access for the attacker, potentially leading to further compromise and exploitation of cloud resources.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: Newly onboarded users who are registering an MFA method for
  the first time will also trigger this detection.
