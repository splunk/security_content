description: 'The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique valid users within 5 minutes. This behavior could represent an adversary
  performing a Password Spraying attack against an Azure Active Directory tenant to
  obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Error Code 50126 represents an invalid
  password. This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat
  hunting exercises.\

  Azure AD tenants can be very different depending on the organization. Users should
  test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold if needed.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: A source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple users is
  not a common for legitimate behavior.
