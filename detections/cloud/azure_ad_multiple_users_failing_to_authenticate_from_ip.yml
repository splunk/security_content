description: 'The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate with 30 unique valid users within 5 minutes. This behavior could 
  represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Azure Active Directory tenant to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Error Code
  50126 represents an invalid password. This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.\

  Azure AD tenants can be very different depending on the organization. Users should test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold if needed.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). 
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs
  log category.
known_false_positives: A source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple users is not a common for legitimate behavior.
