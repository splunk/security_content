type: Anomaly
description: 'The following analytic detects a single source IP failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique valid users within 5 minutes in Azure Active Directory. It leverages
  Azure AD SignInLogs with error code 50126, indicating invalid passwords. This behavior
  is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying attack, where an adversary
  attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges by trying common passwords
  across many accounts. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, or privilege escalation within the Azure AD environment.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: A source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple users is
  not a common for legitimate behavior.
