description: This search is to detect a suspicious attachment file extension in Gsuite
  email that may related to spear phishing attack. This file type is commonly used
  by malware to lure user to click on it to execute malicious code to compromised
  targetted machine. But this search can also catch some normal files related to this
  file type that maybe send by employee or network admin.
search: '`gsuite_gmail` "attachment{}.file_extension_type" IN ("pl", "py", "rb", "sh",
  "bat", "exe", "dll", "cpl", "com", "js", "vbs", "ps1", "reg","swf", "cmd", "go")
  | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="medium" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(attachment{}.file_extension_type) as email_attachments,
  values(attachment{}.sha256) as attachment_sha256, values(payload_size) as payload_size
  by destination{}.service num_message_attachments  subject destination{}.address
  source.address phase severity | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `gsuite_email_suspicious_attachment_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc.
known_false_positives: network admin and normal user may send this file attachment
  as part of their day to day work. having a good protocol in attaching this file
  type to an e-mail may reduce the risk of having a spear phishing attack.
