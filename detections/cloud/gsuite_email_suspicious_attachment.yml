description: The following analytic detects suspicious attachment file extensions
  in GSuite emails, potentially indicating a spear-phishing attack. It leverages GSuite
  Gmail logs to identify emails with attachments having file extensions commonly associated
  with malware, such as .exe, .bat, and .js. This activity is significant as these
  file types are often used to deliver malicious payloads, posing a risk of compromising
  targeted machines. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code
  execution, data breaches, or further network infiltration.
data_source:
- G Suite Gmail
search: '`gsuite_gmail` "attachment{}.file_extension_type" IN ("pl", "py", "rb", "sh",
  "bat", "exe", "dll", "cpl", "com", "js", "vbs", "ps1", "reg","swf", "cmd", "go")
  | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="medium" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(attachment{}.file_extension_type) as email_attachments,
  values(attachment{}.sha256) as attachment_sha256, values(payload_size) as payload_size
  by destination{}.service num_message_attachments  subject destination{}.address
  source.address phase severity | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `gsuite_email_suspicious_attachment_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc.
known_false_positives: network admin and normal user may send this file attachment
  as part of their day to day work. having a good protocol in attaching this file
  type to an e-mail may reduce the risk of having a spear phishing attack.
