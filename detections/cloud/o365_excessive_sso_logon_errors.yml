description: This search detects accounts with high number of Single Sign ON (SSO)
  logon errors. Excessive logon errors may indicate attempts to bruteforce of password
  or single sign on token hijack or reuse.
search: '`o365_management_activity`  Workload=AzureActiveDirectory LogonError=SsoArtifactInvalidOrExpired
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by LogonError ActorIpAddress
  UserAgent UserId | where count > 5 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_excessive_sso_logon_errors_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
