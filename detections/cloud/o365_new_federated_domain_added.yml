description: The following analytic identifies the addition of a new federated domain in an organization's Office 365 environment. This behavior is detected by analyzing the Office 365 management activity logs using the Splunk query o365_management_activity, specifically filtering for the Workload=Exchange and Operation="Add-FederatedDomain" parameters. The addition of a new federated domain can be a significant security concern, as it might indicate unauthorized changes or potential compromises within the Office 365 setup. Attackers, upon gaining sufficient privileges, could add a federated domain to establish a backdoor, bypass security measures, or exfiltrate data. Such unauthorized changes can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and potential compromise of organizational infrastructure. When this analytic is triggered, immediate steps should include reviewing the details of the added federated domain, such as the organization name, originating server, user ID, and user key. Concurrent processes or other indicators of compromise should also be investigated to pinpoint the source of the potential breach.
data_source: []
search: '`o365_management_activity` Operation IN ("*add*", "*new*") AND Operation="*domain*"
  | stats count values(ModifiedProperties{}.NewValue) as new_value by  user user_agent
  authentication_service action Workload Operation | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `o365_new_federated_domain_added_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity.
known_false_positives: The creation of a new Federated domain is not necessarily malicious,
  however these events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential
  abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a similar or different cloud provider.
