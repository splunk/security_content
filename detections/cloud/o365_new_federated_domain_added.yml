description: This search detects the addition of a new Federated domain.
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=Exchange Operation="Add-FederatedDomain"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(Parameters{}.Value)
  as Parameters.Value by ObjectId Operation OrganizationName OriginatingServer UserId
  UserKey | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_new_federated_domain_added_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity.
known_false_positives: The creation of a new Federated domain is not necessarily malicious,
  however these events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential
  abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a similar or different cloud provider.
