description: The following analytic detects the successful deletion of a group within AWS IAM, leveraging CloudTrail IAM events. 
  This action, while not inherently malicious, can serve as a precursor to more sinister activities, such as unauthorized access or 
  privilege escalation attempts. By monitoring for such deletions, the analytic aids in identifying potential preparatory steps towards 
  an attack, allowing for early detection and mitigation. The identification of this behavior is crucial for a SOC to prevent the potential 
  impact of an attack, which could include unauthorized access to sensitive resources or disruption of AWS environment operations.

how_to_implement:  You must install the Data Lake Federated Analytics App and ingest the logs into Splunk.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete groups (least privilege).
