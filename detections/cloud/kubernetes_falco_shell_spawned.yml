description: The following analytic detects instances where a shell is spawned within a Kubernetes container, a behavior often indicative of an attacker gaining unauthorized access. 
  Leveraging Falco, a cloud-native runtime security tool, this analytic monitors system calls within the Kubernetes environment, flagging when a shell is spawned in a container. 
  This behavior is worth identifying for a SOC as it could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, manipulate container processes, or escalate privileges, posing a significant threat to the integrity and security of the Kubernetes infrastructure. 
  The impact of such an attack could be severe, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Falco, a cloud native runtime security tool. 
  Falco is designed to detect anomalous activity in your applications and is a crucial component of this detection rule. 
  To implement this detection rule, you need to install and configure Falco in your Kubernetes environment. 
  Once Falco is set up, it will monitor the system calls in your Kubernetes infrastructure and generate logs for any suspicious activity. 
  These logs are then ingested by Splunk for analysis. Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs.
