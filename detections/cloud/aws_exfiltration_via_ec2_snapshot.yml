description: The following analytic detects a series of AWS API calls related to EC2
  snapshots within a short time window, indicating potential exfiltration via EC2
  Snapshot modifications. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify actions such
  as creating, describing, and modifying snapshot attributes. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate an attacker attempting to exfiltrate data by sharing EC2 snapshots
  externally. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could gain access to sensitive
  information stored in the snapshots, leading to data breaches and potential compliance
  violations.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName IN ("CreateSnapshot", "DescribeSnapshotAttribute",
  "ModifySnapshotAttribute", "DeleteSnapshot") src_ip !="guardduty.amazonaws.com"
  |  bin _time span=5m |  stats count dc(eventName) as distinct_api_calls values(eventName)  values(requestParameters.attributeType)
  as attributeType values(requestParameters.createVolumePermission.add.items{}.userId)
  as aws_account_id_added values(userAgent) as userAgent by _time userName src_ip
  aws_account_id | where distinct_api_calls >= 2 | `aws_exfiltration_via_ec2_snapshot_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs. We have intentionally removed `guardduty.amazonaws.com`
  from src_ip to remove false positives caused by guard duty. We recommend you adjust
  the time window as per your environment.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately shared a
  snapshot with an other account for a specific purpose. Please check any recent change
  requests filed in your organization.
