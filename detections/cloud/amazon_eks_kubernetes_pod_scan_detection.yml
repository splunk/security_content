description: |-
  The following analytic detects unauthenticated requests made against the Kubernetes Pods API, indicating potential unauthorized access attempts. It leverages the `aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` data source, filtering for events where `user.username` is "system:anonymous", `verb` is "list", and `objectRef.resource` is "pods", with `requestURI` set to "/api/v1/pods". This activity is significant as it may signal attempts to access sensitive resources or execute unauthorized commands within the Kubernetes environment. If confirmed malicious, such access could lead to data compromise, unauthorized command execution, or lateral movement within the cluster.
data_source: []
search: '`aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` "user.username"="system:anonymous" verb=list objectRef.resource=pods
  requestURI="/api/v1/pods" | rename source as cluster_name sourceIPs{} as src_ip
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(responseStatus.reason)
  values(responseStatus.code) values(userAgent) values(verb) values(requestURI) by
  src_ip cluster_name user.username user.groups{} | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `amazon_eks_kubernetes_pod_scan_detection_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on forAWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudWatch
  EKS Logs.Please also customize the `kubernetes_pods_aws_scan_fingerprint_detection`
  macro to filter out the false positives.
known_false_positives: Not all unauthenticated requests are malicious, but frequency,
  UA and source IPs and direct request to API provide context.
