description: The following analytic identifies when specific O365 advanced security settings are altered within the Office 365 tenant. If an attacker successfully disables O365 security settings, they can operate within the tenant with reduced risk of detection. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, account compromise, or other malicious activities without leaving a detailed audit trail.

- O365 Universal Audit Log

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Administrators might alter features for troubleshooting, performance reasons, or other administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
