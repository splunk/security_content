description: 'The following analytic detects potential scanning activities within
  a Kubernetes environment. It identifies unauthorized access attempts, probing of
  public APIs, or attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities by monitoring Kubernetes
  audit logs for repeated failed access attempts or unusual API requests. This activity
  is significant for a SOC as it may indicate an attacker''s preliminary reconnaissance
  to gather information about the system. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data, posing a severe security
  risk.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.
  Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
  Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server.
  Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
