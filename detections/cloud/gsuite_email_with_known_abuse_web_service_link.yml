search: '`gsuite_gmail` "link_domain{}" IN ("*pastebin.com*", "*discord*", "*telegram*","t.me")
  | rex field=source.from_header_address "[^@]+@(?<source_domain>[^@]+)" | rex field=destination{}.address
  "[^@]+@(?<dest_domain>[^@]+)" | where not source_domain="internal_test_email.com"
  and dest_domain="internal_test_email.com" | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="low"
  |stats values(link_domain{}) as link_domains min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime count by is_spam source.address source.from_header_address subject destination{}.address
  phase severity | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `gsuite_email_with_known_abuse_web_service_link_filter`'
