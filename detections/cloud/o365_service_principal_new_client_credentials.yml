description: The following analytic identifies the addition of new credentials for Service
  Principals in addition to existing legitimate credentials within a Office 365 tenant. These credentials include both x509 certificates and passwords. It leverages O365 audit logs, specifically events related to credential modifications or additions within the AzureActiveDirectory workload for service principals.
  Service principals represent application identities in Office 365 / AzureAD, and their credentials allow applications to authenticate and access resources. Adding new credentials or modifying existing ones can be an indication of configuration changes, but it can also be a sign of malicious intent 
  If an attacker successfully adds or modifies credentials for a service principal, they can potentially use those credentials to authenticate as the application, gaining access to resources and data the application is permitted to access. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, or malicious operations performed under the guise of the application

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Service Principal client credential modifications may be part
  of legitimate administrative operations. Filter as needed.
