description: The following analytic detects failed attempts to delete AWS IAM groups, triggered by access denial, conflicts, 
  or non-existent groups. It operates by monitoring CloudTrail logs for specific error codes related to deletion failures. 
  This behavior is significant for a SOC as it may indicate unauthorized attempts to modify access controls or disrupt operations 
  by removing groups. Such actions could be part of a larger attack aiming to escalate privileges or impair security protocols. 
  Identifying these attempts allows for timely investigation and mitigation, preventing potential impact on the organizations
  security posture.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete groups (least privilege).
