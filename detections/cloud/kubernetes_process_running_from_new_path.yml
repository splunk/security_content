description: The following analytic identifies processes running from newly seen paths
  within a Kubernetes environment. It leverages process metrics collected via an OTEL
  collector and hostmetrics receiver, and data is pulled from Splunk Observability
  Cloud using the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on. This detection compares
  processes observed in the last hour with those seen over the previous 30 days. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate unauthorized changes, compromised nodes,
  or the introduction of malicious software. If confirmed malicious, it could lead
  to unauthorized process execution, control over critical resources, data exfiltration,
  privilege escalation, or malware introduction within the Kubernetes cluster.

how_to_implement: 'To implement this detection, follow these steps: 
  
  * Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.

  * Enable the hostmetrics/process receiver in the OTEL configuration.

  * Ensure that the process metrics, specifically Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization,
  are enabled.

  * Install the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on. (ref: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247)

  * Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access
  Token.

  * Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input "sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index".

  * In the SIM configuration, set the Organization ID to your Observability Cloud
  Organization ID.

  * Set the Signal Flow Program to the following: data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''A'');
  data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''B''); data(''process.cpu.time'').publish(label=''C'');
  data(''process.disk.io'').publish(label=''D''); data(''process.memory.usage'').publish(label=''E'');
  data(''process.memory.virtual'').publish(label=''F''); data(''process.memory.utilization'').publish(label=''G'');
  data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''H''); data(''process.disk.operations'').publish(label=''I'');
  data(''process.handles'').publish(label=''J''); data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''K'')

  * Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.

  * Leave all other settings at their default values.

  * Run the Search Baseline Of Kubernetes Container Network IO Ratio '
