description: This analytic identifies instances where a user in the Office 365 environment grants consent to an application that requests file permissions, specifically targeting OneDrive or SharePoint. Such permissions mean the application could potentially access, modify, or delete files stored within these services. The detection process leverages O365 audit logs, particularly focusing on events related to OAuth application consents. By examining these logs, the analytic is designed to capture and alert on any actions where users grant consent to applications requesting file-related permissions for OneDrive or SharePoint. The sensitivity of file permissions, especially in platforms as widely utilized as OneDrive and SharePoint, cannot be overstated. While many legitimate applications might require such permissions to operate, there's an inherent risk with malicious or overly permissive applications. Attackers could craft or exploit applications to gain file permissions, aiming to access, exfiltrate, or manipulate sensitive data housed in OneDrive or SharePoint. It's crucial for security operations centers to monitor these consents to ensure that only trustworthy applications gain access and that users aren't inadvertently granting permissions to potentially harmful applications. If this detection flags a true positive, it indicates that an application has been granted permissions that could allow it to interact with OneDrive or SharePoint files in potentially malicious ways. Such actions could lead to data breaches, data loss, or unauthorized data manipulation. Immediate investigation would be required to validate the application's legitimacy, understand the nature of its requested permissions, and assess the potential risks associated with the access it's been granted.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: OAuth applications that require file permissions may be legitimate, investigate and filter as needed.
