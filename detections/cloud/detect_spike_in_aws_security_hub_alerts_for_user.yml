name: Detect Spike in AWS Security Hub Alerts for User

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a spike in the number of AWS Security
  Hub alerts for an AWS IAM User within a 4-hour interval. It leverages AWS Security
  Hub findings data, calculating the average and standard deviation of alerts to detect
  significant deviations. This activity is significant as a sudden increase in alerts
  for a specific user may indicate suspicious behavior or a potential security incident.
  If confirmed malicious, this could signify an ongoing attack, unauthorized access,
  or misuse of IAM credentials, potentially leading to data breaches or further exploitation.

  findings{}.Resources{}.Id as user | bucket span=4h _time | stats count AS alerts
  by _time user | eventstats avg(alerts) as total_launched_avg, stdev(alerts) as total_launched_stdev

  * threshold_value), 1, 0) | search isOutlier=1 | table _time user alerts |`detect_spike_in_aws_security_hub_alerts_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your Security
  Hub inputs. The threshold_value should be tuned to your environment and schedule
  these searches according to the bucket span interval.
