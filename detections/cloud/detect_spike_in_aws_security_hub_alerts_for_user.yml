  for an AWS IAM User in 4 hours intervals.
id: 2a9b80d3-6220-4345-b5ad-290bf5d0d222
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your Security Hub
  inputs. The threshold_value should be tuned to your environment and schedule these searches according to the bucket span interval.
