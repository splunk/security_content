description: The following analytic identifies the suspicious use of the AWS STS GetSessionToken
  API call. It leverages CloudWatch logs to detect instances where this API is invoked,
  focusing on fields such as source IP address, event time, user identity, and status.
  This activity is significant because attackers can use these tokens to move laterally
  within the AWS environment and escalate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this
  could lead to unauthorized access and control over AWS resources, potentially compromising
  sensitive data and critical infrastructure.

  | search eventName=GetSessionToken | table sourceIPAddress eventTime userIdentity.arn

how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add-on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudwatch logs
known_false_positives: Sts:GetSessionToken can be very noisy as in certain environments
  numerous calls of this type can be executed. This search can be adjusted to provide
  specific values to identify cases of abuse. In specific environments the use of
  field requestParameters.serialNumber will need to be used.
