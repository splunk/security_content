description: The following analytic identifies instances where email forwarding has
  been enabled on mailboxes within an Office 365 environment. It detects this activity
  by monitoring the Set-Mailbox operation within the o365_management_activity logs,
  specifically looking for changes to the ForwardingAddress or ForwardingSmtpAddress
  parameters. This activity is significant as unauthorized email forwarding can lead
  to data exfiltration and unauthorized access to sensitive information. If confirmed
  malicious, attackers could intercept and redirect emails, potentially compromising
  confidential communications and leading to data breaches.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Email forwarding may be configured for legitimate purposes,
  filter as needed.
