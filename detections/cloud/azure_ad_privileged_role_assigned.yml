description: The following analytic detects the assignment of privileged Azure Active
  Directory roles to a user. It leverages Azure AD audit logs, specifically monitoring
  the "Add member to role" operation. This activity is significant as adversaries
  may assign privileged roles to compromised accounts to maintain persistence within
  the Azure AD environment. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to
  escalate privileges, access sensitive information, and maintain long-term control
  over the Azure AD infrastructure.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Add member to role

  | rename initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName as initiatedBy 
  | rename targetResources{}.modifiedProperties{}.newValue  as roles 
  | eval role=mvindex(roles,1)

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators will legitimately assign the privileged roles
  users as part of administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
