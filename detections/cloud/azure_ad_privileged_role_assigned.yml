description: The following analytic identifies the assignment of sensitive and privileged
  Azure Active Directory roles to an Azure AD user. Adversaries and red teams alike
  may assign these roles to a compromised account to establish Persistence in an Azure
  AD environment.
data_source: 
- Azure Active Directory Add member to role
search: ' `azure_monitor_aad`  "operationName"="Add member to role" | rename properties.*  as * 
  | rename initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName as initiatedBy 
  | rename targetResources{}.modifiedProperties{}.newValue  as roles 
  | eval role=mvindex(roles,1)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user) as user by initiatedBy, result, operationName, role
  | lookup privileged_azure_ad_roles azureadrole AS role OUTPUT isprvilegedadrole description 
  | search isprvilegedadrole = True 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `azure_ad_privileged_role_assigned_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators will legitimately assign the privileged roles
  users as part of administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
