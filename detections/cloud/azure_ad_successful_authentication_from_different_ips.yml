description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account successfully authenticating
  from more than one unique Ip address in the span of 30 minutes. This behavior could
  represent an adversary who has stolen credentials via a phishing attack or some
  other method and using them to access corporate online resources around the same
  time as a legitimate user. As users may behave differently across organizations,
  security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: A user with successful authentication events from different
  Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed
  and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
