description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account successfully authenticating from more than one unique Ip address in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior could represent
  an adversary who has stolen credentials via a phishing attack or some other method and using them to access corporate online resources around the same time as a legitimate user.
  As users may behave differently across organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). 
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs
  log category.
known_false_positives: A user with successful authentication events from different Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
