description: This search looks at cloud-infrastructure events where an instance is
  created in any region within the last hour and then compares it to a lookup file
  of previously seen regions where instances have been created.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Initial`
  to build the initial table of images observed and times. You must also enable the
  second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Update` to keep this table
  up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for
  this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_in_previously_unused_region_filter`
  macro.
