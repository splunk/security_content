name: Cloud Compute Instance Created In Previously Unused Region

description: The following analytic detects the creation of a cloud compute instance
  in a region that has not been previously used within the last hour. It leverages
  cloud infrastructure logs and compares the regions of newly created instances against
  a lookup file of historically used regions. This activity is significant because
  the creation of instances in new regions can indicate unauthorized or suspicious
  activity, such as an attacker attempting to evade detection or establish a foothold
  in a less monitored area. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  resource usage, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the cloud environment.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Initial`
  to build the initial table of images observed and times. You must also enable the
  second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Update` to keep this table
  up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for
  this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_in_previously_unused_region_filter`
  macro.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a user has unknowingly started an instance
  in a new region. Please verify that this activity is legitimate.
