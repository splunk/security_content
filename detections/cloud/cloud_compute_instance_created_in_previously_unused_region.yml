description: This search looks at cloud-infrastructure events where an instance is
  created in any region within the last hour and then compares it to a lookup file
  of previously seen regions where instances have been created.
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime values(All_Changes.object_id)
  as dest, count from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.action=created by All_Changes.vendor_region,
  All_Changes.user | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | lookup previously_seen_cloud_regions
  vendor_region as vendor_region OUTPUTNEW firstTimeSeen, enough_data | eventstats
  max(enough_data) as enough_data | where enough_data=1 | eval firstTimeSeenRegion=min(firstTimeSeen)
  | where isnull(firstTimeSeenRegion) OR firstTimeSeenRegion > relative_time(now(),
  "-24h@h") | table firstTime, user, dest, count , vendor_region | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `cloud_compute_instance_created_in_previously_unused_region_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Initial`
  to build the initial table of images observed and times. You must also enable the
  second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Update` to keep this table
  up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for
  this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_in_previously_unused_region_filter`
  macro.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a user has unknowingly started an instance
  in a new region. Please verify that this activity is legitimate.
