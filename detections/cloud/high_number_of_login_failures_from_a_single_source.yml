description: The following analytic detects multiple failed login attempts in Office365
  Azure Active Directory from a single source IP address. It leverages Office365 management
  activity logs, specifically AzureActiveDirectoryStsLogon records, aggregating these
  logs in 5-minute intervals to count failed login attempts. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate brute-force attacks or password spraying, which are critical
  to monitor. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to
  Office365 accounts, leading to potential data breaches, lateral movement within
  the organization, or further malicious activities using the compromised account.
data_source:
- O365 UserLoginFailed
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory Operation=UserLoginFailed
  record_type=AzureActiveDirectoryStsLogon | bucket span=5m _time | stats dc(_raw)
  AS failed_attempts values(user) as user values(LogonError) as LogonError values(signature)
  as signature values(UserAgent) as UserAgent by _time, src_ip | where failed_attempts
  > 10 | `high_number_of_login_failures_from_a_single_source_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events. Adjust the threshold value to suit the specific
  environment, as environments with naturally higher login failures might generate
  false positives at a lower threshold.
known_false_positives: An Ip address with more than 10 failed authentication attempts
  in the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
