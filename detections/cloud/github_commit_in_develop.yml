description: The following analytic detects commits pushed directly to the 'develop'
  or 'main' branches in a GitHub repository. It leverages GitHub logs, focusing on
  commit metadata such as author details, commit messages, and timestamps. This activity
  is significant as direct commits to these branches can bypass the review process,
  potentially introducing unvetted changes. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
  to unauthorized code modifications, introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors into
  the codebase, and compromising the integrity of the development lifecycle.
data_source:
- GitHub
search: '`github` branches{}.name = main OR branches{}.name = develop |  stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  by commit.author.html_url commit.commit.author.email
  commit.author.login commit.commit.message repository.pushed_at commit.commit.committer.date
  | eval phase="code" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `github_commit_in_develop_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to github logs having the fork, commit, push metadata that can be use
  to monitor the changes in a github project.
