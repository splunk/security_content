description: The following analytic detects the deletion of CloudWatch log groups in AWS, identified through `DeleteLogGroup` events in CloudTrail logs. This method leverages Amazon Security Lake logs parsed in the OCSF format. The activity is significant because attackers may delete log groups to evade detection and disrupt logging capabilities, hindering incident response efforts. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace their activities and potentially leading to undetected data breaches or further malicious actions within the compromised AWS environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has deleted CloudWatch logging. Please investigate this activity.
