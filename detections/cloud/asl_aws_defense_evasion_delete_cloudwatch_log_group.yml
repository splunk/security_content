description: The following analytic detects the deletion of CloudWatch log groups
  in AWS, identified through `DeleteLogGroup` events in CloudTrail logs. This method
  leverages Amazon Security Lake logs parsed in the OCSF format. The activity is significant
  because attackers may delete log groups to evade detection and disrupt logging capabilities,
  hindering incident response efforts. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow
  attackers to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace their activities and
  potentially leading to undetected data breaches or further malicious actions within
  the compromised AWS environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon
  Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related
  data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from
  Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events
  using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876)
  or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has deleted CloudWatch logging. Please investigate this activity.
