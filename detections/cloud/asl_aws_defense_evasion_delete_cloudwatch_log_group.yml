description: The following analytic detects the deletion of CloudWatch Log Groups within AWS CloudTrail logs. 
  This action is indicative of an attacker's attempt to evade detection by disrupting the logging and monitoring capabilities of CloudWatch. 
  By identifying and analyzing `DeleteLogGroup` events, this analytic helps in uncovering efforts to obscure malicious activities within a 
  compromised AWS environment. Such evasion tactics are critical for a Security Operations Center (SOC) to identify as they signal an 
  attacker's intent to operate undetected, posing a significant threat to the integrity and security of cloud environments. 
  The impact of this attack is substantial, as it can lead to a loss of visibility into potentially malicious activities, 
  hindering incident response and forensics efforts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has deleted CloudWatch logging. Please investigate this activity.
