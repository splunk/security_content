type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies an excessive number of authentication failures, including failed attempts against MFA prompt codes. It uses data from the `o365_management_activity` dataset, focusing on events where the authentication status is marked as failure. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a brute force attack or an attempt to compromise user accounts. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further exploitation within the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: The threshold for alert is above 10 attempts and this should reduce the number of false positives.
