description: This search detects when an excessive number of authentication failures
  occur this search also includes attempts against MFA prompt codes
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory UserAuthenticationMethod=*
  status=failure | stats count earliest(_time) AS firstTime latest(_time) AS lastTime
  values(UserAuthenticationMethod) AS UserAuthenticationMethod values(UserAgent) AS
  UserAgent values(status) AS status values(src_ip) AS src_ip by user | where count
  > 10 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_excessive_authentication_failures_alert_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: The threshold for alert is above 10 attempts and this should
  reduce the number of false positives.
