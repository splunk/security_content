description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account with more than 20 failed authentication events in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior 
  could represent a brute force attack against the account. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the threshold of this detection.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). 
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs
  log category.
known_false_positives: A user with more than 20 failed authentication attempts in the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
