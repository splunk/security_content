description: The following analytic detects a single source IP address failing to
  authenticate into more than 20 unique Google Workspace user accounts within a 5-minute
  window. It leverages Google Workspace login failure events to identify potential
  password spraying attacks. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary
  attempting to gain unauthorized access or elevate privileges within the Google Cloud
  Platform. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized access
  to sensitive resources, data breaches, or further exploitation within the environment.
data_source:
- Google Workspace login_failure
search: '`gws_reports_login` event.type = login event.name = login_failure | bucket
  span=5m _time | stats count dc(user) AS unique_accounts values(user) as tried_accounts
  values(authentication_method) AS authentication_method earliest(_time) as firstTime
  latest(_time) as lastTime by _time event.name src app id.applicationName | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` |  where unique_accounts > 20 | `gcp_multiple_users_failing_to_authenticate_from_ip_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google
  Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows
  Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google
  Workspace APIs. We would also recommend tuning the detection by adjusting the window
  `span` and `unique_accounts` threshold values according to your environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the User log events.
known_false_positives: No known false postives for this detection. Please review this
  alert.
