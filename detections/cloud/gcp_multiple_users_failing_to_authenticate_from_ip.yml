name: GCP Multiple Users Failing To Authenticate From Ip

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate
  into the Google Workspace user accounts with more than 20 unique valid users within
  5 minutes. These user accounts may have other privileges with respect to access
  to other sensitive resources in the Google Cloud Platform. This behavior could represent
  an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Google Workspace environment
  to obtain initial access or elevate privileges.
data_source: []
search: '`gws_reports_login` event.type = login event.name = login_failure | bucket
  span=5m _time | stats count dc(user) AS unique_accounts values(user) as tried_accounts
  values(authentication_method) AS authentication_method earliest(_time) as firstTime
  latest(_time) as lastTime by _time event.name src app id.applicationName | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google
  Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows
  Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google
  Workspace APIs. We would also recommend tuning the detection by adjusting the window
  `span` and `unique_accounts` threshold values according to your environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the User log events.
known_false_positives: No known false postives for this detection. Please review this
  alert.
