name: GCP Multiple Users Failing To Authenticate From Ip

type: Anomaly
datamodel: []
description: The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate into the Google Workspace user accounts with more than 20 unique valid users within 5 minutes. These user accounts may have other privileges with respect to access to other sensitive resources in the Google Cloud Platform. This behavior could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Google Workspace environment to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. 
search: "`gws_reports_login` event.type = login event.name = login_failure | bucket span=5m _time | stats count dc(user) AS unique_accounts values(user) as tried_accounts values(authentication_method) AS authentication_method earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime by _time event.name src app id.applicationName | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` |  where unique_accounts > 20 | `gcp_multiple_users_failing_to_authenticate_from_ip_filter`"
how_to_implement:  You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google Workspace APIs. We would also recommend tuning the detection by adjusting the window `span` and `unique_accounts` threshold values according to your environment.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the User log events.
known_false_positives: No known false postives for this detection. Please review this alert.
