description: The following analytic detects the registration of a new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method for an AWS account. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify the `CreateVirtualMFADevice` event. This activity is significant because adversaries who gain unauthorized access to an AWS account may register a new MFA method to maintain persistence. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to secure their access, making it difficult to detect and remove their presence, potentially leading to further unauthorized activities and data breaches.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail CreateVirtualMFADevice
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=CreateVirtualMFADevice | stats count values(requestParameters.virtualMFADeviceName) as virtualMFADeviceName min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by eventSource aws_account_id errorCode userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_new_mfa_method_registered_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works when AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: Newly onboarded users who are registering an MFA method for the first time will also trigger this detection.
