description: The following analytic detects the registration of a new Multi-Factor
  Authentication (MFA) method for an AWS account. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs
  to identify the `CreateVirtualMFADevice` event. This activity is significant because
  adversaries who gain unauthorized access to an AWS account may register a new MFA
  method to maintain persistence. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to secure their access, making it difficult to detect and remove their presence,
  potentially leading to further unauthorized activities and data breaches.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail CreateVirtualMFADevice
search: ' `cloudtrail` eventName=CreateVirtualMFADevice | stats count values(requestParameters.virtualMFADeviceName)
  as virtualMFADeviceName min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by eventSource
  aws_account_id errorCode userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn
  src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `aws_new_mfa_method_registered_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works when AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: Newly onboarded users who are registering an MFA method for
  the first time will also trigger this detection.
