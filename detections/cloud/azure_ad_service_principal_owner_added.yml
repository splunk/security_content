description: The following analytic identifies the addition of a new owner for a Service
  Principal within an Azure AD tenant. An Azure Service Principal is an identity designed
  to be used with applications, services, and automated tools to access resources.
  It is similar to a service account within an Active Directory environment. Service
  Principal authentication does not support multi-factor authentication nor conditional
  access policies. Adversaries and red teams alike who have obtained administrative
  access may add a new owner for an existing Service Principal to establish Persistence
  and obtain single-factor access to an Azure AD environment. Attackers who are looking to
  escalate their privileges by leveraging a Service Principals permissions may also add a new owner.
