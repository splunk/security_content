description: The following analytic detects `StopLogging` events within AWS CloudTrail logs, a critical action that adversaries 
  may use to evade detection. By halting the logging of their malicious activities, attackers aim to operate undetected within a 
  compromised AWS environment. This detection is achieved by monitoring for specific CloudTrail log entries that indicate the cessation 
  of logging activities. Identifying such behavior is crucial for a Security Operations Center (SOC), as it signals an attempt to 
  undermine the integrity of logging mechanisms, potentially allowing malicious activities to proceed without observation. 
  The impact of this evasion tactic is significant, as it can severely hamper incident response and forensic investigations by obscuring 
  the attacker's actions.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has stopped cloudtrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
