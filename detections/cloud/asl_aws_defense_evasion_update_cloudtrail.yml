description: The following analytic detects `UpdateTrail` events within AWS CloudTrail logs, aiming to identify attempts by attackers to evade 
  detection by altering logging configurations. By updating CloudTrail settings with incorrect parameters, such as changing multi-regional logging 
  to a single region, attackers can impair the logging of their activities across other regions. This behavior is crucial for Security Operations 
  Centers (SOCs) to identify, as it indicates an adversary's intent to operate undetected within a compromised AWS environment. The impact of such 
  evasion tactics is significant, potentially allowing malicious activities to proceed without being logged, thereby hindering incident response 
  and forensic investigations.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has updated cloudtrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
