description: The following analytic identifies an Ip address failing to authenticate
  20 or more times to an Azure AD tenant in the span of 10 minutes. This behavior could
  represent a brute force attack againstan Azure AD to obtain initial access or elevate
  privileges. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize
  the threshold of this detection.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: An Ip address with more than 20 failed authentication attempts
  in the span of 10 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
