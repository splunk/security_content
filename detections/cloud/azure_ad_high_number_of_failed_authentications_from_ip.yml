description: The following analytic identifies an Ip address which failing to authenticate 20 or more times to an Azure AD tenant in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior 
  could represent a brute force attack againstan Azure AD. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the threshold of this detection.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). 
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs
  log category.
known_false_positives: An Ip address with more than 20 failed authentication attempts in the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
