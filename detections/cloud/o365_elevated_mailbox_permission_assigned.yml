description: This detection triggers on the assignment of elevated mailbox permissions within an Office 365 environment, specifically through the Add-MailboxPermission operation, as logged under the Exchange workload in the o365_management_activity. It is meticulously designed to spotlight instances where critical permissions such as FullAccess, ChangePermission, or ChangeOwner are granted, marking significant alterations in mailbox access controls.
