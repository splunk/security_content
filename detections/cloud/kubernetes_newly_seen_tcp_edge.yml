description: 'This analytic detects TCP communication between a newly seen source and destination workload pair. 
  This is done to identify changes in network behavior between workloads in a kubernetes cluster. This detection leverages Network performance Monitoring 
  metrics harvested using an OTEL collector, and is pulled from Splunk Observability cloud using the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on. (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247). 
  This detection compares network activity between workloads over the last 1 hour, with those over the last 30 days in order to detect newly seen inter workload communication.
  Newly seen network connections in a microservices based app indicate a change in behavior which could indicate potential security threats or anomalies. 
  Distributed applications typically have common established network connection topologies, and new connections are often either an indication of a change in the application or an active threat.
  Unauthorized connections may enable the attacker to infiltrate the applications ecosystem, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of sensitive information, 
  or disruption of critical services. Bad actors may exploit these connections to gain access, escalate privileges, move laterally within the microservices, or introduce malicious code or payloads, 
  putting the applications integrity, availability, and confidentiality at risk.'

how_to_implement: 'To gather NPM metrics the Open Telemetry to the Kubernetes Cluster and 
  enable Network Performance Monitoring according to instructions found in Splunk Docs 
  https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/infrastructure/network-explorer/network-explorer-setup.html#network-explorer-setup 
  In order to access those metrics from within Splunk Enterprise and ES, the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring add-on must be installed and 
  configured on a Splunk Search Head.  Once installed, first configure the add-on with your O11y Cloud Org ID and Access Token. 
  Lastly set up the add-on to ingest metrics from O11y cloud using the following settings, and any other settings left at default:\
  
  * Name sim_npm_metrics_to_metrics_index \

  * Org ID <Your O11y Cloud Org Id> \
  
  * Signal Flow Program data(''tcp.packets'').publish(label=''A''); data(''tcp.bytes'').publish(label=''B''); data(''tcp.new_sockets'').publish(label=''C''); data(''udp.packets'').publish(label=''D''); data(''udp.bytes'').publish(label=''E'') \
  
  * Metric Resolution 10000'
