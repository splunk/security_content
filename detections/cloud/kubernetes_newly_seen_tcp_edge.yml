description: 'The following analytic identifies newly seen TCP communication between
  source and destination workload pairs within a Kubernetes cluster. It leverages
  Network Performance Monitoring metrics collected via an OTEL collector and pulled
  from Splunk Observability Cloud. The detection compares network activity over the
  last hour with the past 30 days to spot new inter-workload communications. This
  is significant as new connections can indicate changes in application behavior or
  potential security threats. If malicious, unauthorized connections could lead to
  data breaches, privilege escalation, lateral movement, or disruption of critical
  services, compromising the application''s integrity, availability, and confidentiality.'

how_to_implement: 'To gather NPM metrics the Open Telemetry to the Kubernetes Cluster and 
  enable Network Performance Monitoring according to instructions found in Splunk Docs 
  https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/infrastructure/network-explorer/network-explorer-setup.html#network-explorer-setup 
  In order to access those metrics from within Splunk Enterprise and ES, the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring add-on must be installed and 
  configured on a Splunk Search Head.  Once installed, first configure the add-on with your O11y Cloud Org ID and Access Token. 
  Lastly set up the add-on to ingest metrics from O11y cloud using the following settings, and any other settings left at default:
  
  * Name sim_npm_metrics_to_metrics_index 

  * Metric Resolution 10000'
