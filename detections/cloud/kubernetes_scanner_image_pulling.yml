description: The following analytic detects the pulling of known Kubernetes security scanner images such as kube-hunter, kube-bench, and kube-recon. It leverages Kubernetes logs ingested through Splunk Connect for Kubernetes, specifically monitoring for messages indicating the pulling of these images. This activity is significant because the use of security scanners can indicate an attempt to identify vulnerabilities within the Kubernetes environment. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to the discovery and exploitation of security weaknesses, potentially compromising the entire Kubernetes cluster.
