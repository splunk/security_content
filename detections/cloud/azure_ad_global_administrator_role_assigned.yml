description: The following analytic detects the assignment of the Azure AD Global
  Administrator role to a user. It leverages Azure Active Directory AuditLogs to identify
  when the "Add member to role" operation includes the "Global Administrator" role.
  This activity is significant because the Global Administrator role grants extensive
  access to data, resources, and settings, similar to a Domain Administrator in traditional
  AD environments. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to establish
  persistence, escalate privileges, and potentially gain control over Azure resources,
  posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Add member to role
search: '`azure_monitor_aad`  operationName="Add member to role"  properties.targetResources{}.modifiedProperties{}.newValue="\"Global
  Administrator\"" | rename properties.* as * | rename initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName
  as initiatedBy | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user)
  as user by initiatedBy, result, operationName | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `azure_ad_global_administrator_role_assigned_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the Global Administrator
  role to a user. Filter as needed.
