description: The following analytic identifies the assignment of the Azure AD Global
  Administrator role to an Azure AD user. The Global Administrator role is the most
  powerful administrator role in Azure AD and provides almost unlimited access to
  data, resources and settings. It is equivalent to the Domain Administrator group
  in an Active Directory environment. While Azure AD roles do not grant access to
  Azure services and resources, it is possible for a Global Administrator account
  to gain control of Azure resources. Adversaries and red teams alike may assign this
  role to a compromised account to establish Persistence or escalate their privileges in an Azure AD environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the Global Administrator
  role to a user. Filter as needed.
