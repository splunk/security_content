description: 'This detection detects outbound network traffic volume anomalies from processes running within containerised workloads. 
  Anomalies are provided with context identifying the Kubernetes cluster, the workload name, and the type of anomaly. This detection 
  leverages Network performance Monitoring metrics harvested using an OTEL collector, and is pulled from Splunk Observability cloud 
  using the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on. (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247). This detection compares the tcp.bytes, 
  tcp.new_sockets, tcp.packets, udp.bytes, udp.packets metrics for source (transmitting) workload process pairs over the last 1 hout, 
  with the average of those metrics for those pairs over the last 30 days in order to detect any anonymously high outbound network activity. 
  Anonymously high outbound network traffic from a process running in a container is a potential indication of data exfiltration, or an indication that the process has been modified. 
  Anomalously high outbound network activity from a process running within a container suggests the potential compromise, which may lead to unauthorized data exfiltration, 
  communication with malicious entities, or the propagation of malware to external systems. The compromised container could also serve as a pivot point 
  for further attacks within the containerized environment.'

how_to_implement: 'To gather NPM metrics the Open Telemetry to the Kubernetes Cluster and 
  enable Network Performance Monitoring according to instructions found in Splunk Docs 
  https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/infrastructure/network-explorer/network-explorer-setup.html#network-explorer-setup 
  In order to access those metrics from within Splunk Enterprise and ES, the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring add-on must be installed and 
  configured on a Splunk Search Head.  Once installed, first configure the add-on with your O11y Cloud Org ID and Access Token. 
  Lastly set up the add-on to ingest metrics from O11y cloud using the following settings, and any other settings left at default:\
  
  * Name sim_npm_metrics_to_metrics_index \

  * Org ID <Your O11y Cloud Org Id> \
  
  * Signal Flow Program data(''tcp.packets'').publish(label=''A''); data(''tcp.bytes'').publish(label=''B''); data(''tcp.new_sockets'').publish(label=''C''); data(''udp.packets'').publish(label=''D''); data(''udp.bytes'').publish(label=''E'') \
  
  * Metric Resolution 10000'
