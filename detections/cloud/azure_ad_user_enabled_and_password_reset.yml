description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD user enabling a previously
  disabled account and resetting its password within 2 minutes. This behavior could
  represent an adversary who has obtained administrative access and is trying to establish
  a backdoor identity within an Azure AD tenant.

search: ' `azuread` (operationName="Enable account" OR operationName="Reset password (by admin)" 
  OR operationName="Update user") | transaction properties.targetResources{}.userPrincipalName

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: While not common, Administrators may enable accounts and reset
  their passwords for legitimate reasons. Filter as needed.
