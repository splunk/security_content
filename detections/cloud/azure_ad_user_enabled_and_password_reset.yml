description: The following analytic detects an Azure AD user enabling a previously
  disabled account and resetting its password within 2 minutes. It uses Azure Active
  Directory events to identify this sequence of actions. This activity is significant
  because it may indicate an adversary with administrative access attempting to establish
  a backdoor identity within the Azure AD tenant. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow the attacker to maintain persistent access, escalate privileges, and potentially
  exfiltrate sensitive information from the environment.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Enable account 
- Azure Active Directory Reset password (by admin) 
- Azure Active Directory Update user
search: ' `azure_monitor_aad`  (operationName="Enable account" OR operationName="Reset
  password (by admin)" OR operationName="Update user") | transaction user startsWith=(operationName="Enable
  account") endsWith=(operationName="Reset password (by admin)") maxspan=2m | rename
  properties.* as * | rename initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName as initiatedBy | stats

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: While not common, Administrators may enable accounts and reset
  their passwords for legitimate reasons. Filter as needed.
