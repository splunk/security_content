description: The following analytic detects an Azure AD user enabling a previously disabled account and resetting its password within 2 minutes. It uses Azure Active Directory events to identify this sequence of actions. This activity is significant because it may indicate an adversary with administrative access attempting to establish a backdoor identity within the Azure AD tenant. If confirmed malicious, this could allow the attacker to maintain persistent access, escalate privileges, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information from the environment.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Enable account
- Azure Active Directory Reset password (by admin)
- Azure Active Directory Update user
search: '`azure_monitor_aad`  (operationName="Enable account" OR operationName="Reset password (by admin)" OR operationName="Update user") | transaction user startsWith=(operationName="Enable account") endsWith=(operationName="Reset password (by admin)") maxspan=2m | rename properties.* as * | rename initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName as initiatedBy | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(operationName) as operationName values(initiatedBy) as initiatedBy by user, result | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `azure_ad_user_enabled_and_password_reset_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: While not common, Administrators may enable accounts and reset their passwords for legitimate reasons. Filter as needed.
