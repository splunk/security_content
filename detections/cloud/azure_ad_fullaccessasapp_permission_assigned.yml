description: The following analytic detects the assignment of the 'full_access_as_app'
  permission to an application within Office 365 Exchange Online. This is identified
  by the GUID 'dc890d15-9560-4a4c-9b7f-a736ec74ec40' and the ResourceAppId '00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000'.
  The detection leverages the azure_monitor_aad data source, focusing on AuditLogs
  with the operation name 'Update application'. This activity is significant as it
  grants broad control over Office 365 operations, including full access to all mailboxes
  and the ability to send emails as any user. If malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  access and data exfiltration.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: The full_access_as_app API permission may be assigned to legitimate
  applications. Filter as needed.
