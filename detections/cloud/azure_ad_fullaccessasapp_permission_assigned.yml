description: The following analytic identifies when the 'full_access_as_app' permission, marked by the GUID 'dc890d15-9560-4a4c-9b7f-a736ec74ec40', is assigned to an application within Office 365 Exchange Online, identified by ResourceAppId '00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000'. This permission grants broad control over Office 365 operations, including full access to all mailboxes and the capability to send emails as any user. The query utilizes the azure_monitor_aad data source, focusing on AuditLogs with the operation name 'Update application'. This monitoring is crucial for early detection of potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration, as the 'full_access_as_app' permission could lead to significant security incidents if exploited.
