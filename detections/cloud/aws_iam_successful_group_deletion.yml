datamodel: []
description: The following query uses IAM events to track the success of a group being
  deleted on AWS. This is typically not indicative of malicious behavior, but a precurser
  to additional events thay may unfold. Review parallel IAM events - recently added
  users, new groups and so forth. Inversely, review failed attempts in a similar manner.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource=iam.amazonaws.com eventName=DeleteGroup errorCode=success
  (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime values(requestParameters.groupName) by src eventName eventSource errorCode
  user_agent awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_successful_group_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS Cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete groups (least privilege).
