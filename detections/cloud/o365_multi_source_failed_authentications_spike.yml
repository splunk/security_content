description: The following analytic identifies a spike in failed authentication attempts
  within an Office 365 environment, indicative of a potential distributed password
  spraying attack. It leverages UserLoginFailed events from O365 Management Activity
  logs, focusing on ErrorNumber 50126. This detection is significant as it highlights
  attempts to bypass security controls using multiple IP addresses and user agents.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
  privilege escalation, and lateral movement within the organization. Early detection
  is crucial to prevent account takeovers and mitigate subsequent threats.
search: ' `o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory Operation=UserLoginFailed
  ErrorNumber=50126 | bucket span=5m _time | eval uniqueIPUserCombo = src_ip . "-"
  . user | stats dc(uniqueIPUserCombo) as uniqueIpUserCombinations, dc(user) as uniqueUsers,
  dc(src_ip) as uniqueIPs, values(user) as user, values(src_ip) as ips, values(user_agent)
  as user_agents by _time | where uniqueIpUserCombinations > 20 AND uniqueUsers >

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events. The thresholds set within the analytic (such
  as unique IPs, unique users, etc.) are initial guidelines and should be customized
  based on the organization's user behavior and risk profile. Security teams are encouraged
  to adjust these thresholds to optimize the balance between detecting genuine threats
  and minimizing false positives, ensuring the detection is tailored to their specific
  environment.
known_false_positives: This detection may yield false positives in scenarios where
  legitimate bulk sign-in activities occur, such as during company-wide system updates
  or when users are accessing resources from varying locations in a short time frame,
  such as in the case of VPNs or cloud services that rotate IP addresses. Filter as
  needed.
