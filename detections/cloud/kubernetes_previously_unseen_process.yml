description: The following analytic detects previously unseen processes within the
  Kubernetes environment on master or worker nodes. It leverages process metrics collected
  via an OTEL collector and hostmetrics receiver, and data is pulled from Splunk Observability
  Cloud. This detection compares processes observed in the last hour against those
  seen in the previous 30 days. Identifying new processes is crucial as they may indicate
  unauthorized activity or attempts to compromise the node. If confirmed malicious,
  these processes could lead to data exfiltration, privilege escalation, denial-of-service
  attacks, or the introduction of malware, posing significant risks to the Kubernetes
  cluster.

how_to_implement: 'To implement this detection, follow these steps: 
  
  * Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.

  * Enable the hostmetrics/process receiver in the OTEL configuration.

  * Ensure that the process metrics, specifically Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization,
  are enabled.

  * Install the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on. (ref: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247)

  * Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access
  Token.

  * Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input "sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index".

  * In the SIM configuration, set the Organization ID to your Observability Cloud
  Organization ID.

  * Set the Signal Flow Program to the following: data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''A'');
  data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''B''); data(''process.cpu.time'').publish(label=''C'');
  data(''process.disk.io'').publish(label=''D''); data(''process.memory.usage'').publish(label=''E'');
  data(''process.memory.virtual'').publish(label=''F''); data(''process.memory.utilization'').publish(label=''G'');
  data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''H''); data(''process.disk.operations'').publish(label=''I'');
  data(''process.handles'').publish(label=''J''); data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''K'')

  * Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.

  * Leave all other settings at their default values.

  * Run the Search Baseline Of Kubernetes Container Network IO Ratio'
