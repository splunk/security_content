type: Anomaly
description: This analytic detects newly seen process within the Kubernetes scope on a master or worker node. This detection leverages process metrics harvested using an 
  OTEL collector and hostmetrics receiever, and is pulled from Splunk Observability cloud using the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on. (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247). 
  This detection compares the processes seen for each node over the previous 1 hour with those over the previous 30 days up until the previous 1 hour. 
  The specific metric used by this detection is process.memory.utilization. Newly seen processes on a Kubernetes worker node are concerning as they may represent security risks and 
  anomalies that could be related to unauthorized activity. New processes may be introduced  in an attempt to compromise the node or gain control of the Kubernetes cluster. 
  By detecting these processes, they can be investigated, and correlated with other anomalous activity for that host. Newly seen processes may be part of an attacker's strategy to compromise the node, 
  gain unauthorized access, and subsequently extend their control to the entire Kubernetes cluster. These processes could facilitate activities such as data exfiltration, privilege escalation, 
  denial-of-service attacks, or the introduction of malware and backdoors, putting sensitive data, applications, and the entire infrastructure at risk.  
  The consequences may include data breaches, service disruptions, financial losses, and reputational damage, underscoring the need to identify anomalous process and associate them with any concurrent risk activity.

how_to_implement: 'To implement this detection, follow these steps:
  1. Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.
  2. Enable the hostmetrics/process receiver in the OTEL configuration.
  3. Ensure that the process metrics, specifically Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization, are enabled.
  4. Install the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on.
  5. Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access Token.
  6. Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input "sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index".
  7. In the SIM configuration, set the Organization ID to your Observability Cloud Organization ID.
  8. Set the Signal Flow Program to the following: data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''A''); data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''B''); data(''process.cpu.time'').publish(label=''C''); data(''process.disk.io'').publish(label=''D''); data(''process.memory.usage'').publish(label=''E''); data(''process.memory.virtual'').publish(label=''F''); data(''process.memory.utilization'').publish(label=''G''); data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''H''); data(''process.disk.operations'').publish(label=''I''); data(''process.handles'').publish(label=''J''); data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''K'')
  9. Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.
  10. Leave all other settings at their default values.'
