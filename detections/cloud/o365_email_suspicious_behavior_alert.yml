description: The following analytic identifies when one of O365 the built-in security detections for suspicious email behaviors are triggered.  These alerts often indicate that an attacker may have compromised a mailbox within the environment. Any detections from built-in Office 365 capabilities should be monitored and responded to appropriately. Certain premium Office 365 capabilities further enhance these detection and response functions.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events. The alerts must be enabled in the o365 security portal.
known_false_positives: Users emailing for legitimate business purposes that appear suspicious.
