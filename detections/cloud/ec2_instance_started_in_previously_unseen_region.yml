description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where an instance is started
  in a particular region in the last one hour and then compares it to a lookup file
  of previously seen regions where an instance was started
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Run the "Previously seen AWS Regions" support search only once to create
  of baseline of previously seen regions.
