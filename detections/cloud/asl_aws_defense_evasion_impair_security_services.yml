description: The following analytic detects the deletion of critical AWS Security
  Services configurations, such as CloudWatch alarms, GuardDuty detectors, and Web
  Application Firewall rules. It leverages Amazon Security Lake logs to identify specific
  API calls like "DeleteLogStream" and "DeleteDetector." This activity is significant
  because adversaries often use these actions to disable security monitoring and evade
  detection. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to operate undetected,
  leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and prolonged persistence
  within the AWS environment.

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `asl_aws_defense_evasion_impair_security_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon
  Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related
  data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from
  Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events
  using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876)
  or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that it is a legitimate admin activity. Please consider filtering out these noisy
  events using userAgent, user_arn field names.
