description: The following analytic identifies an authentication attempt event against
  an AWS Console that fails during the Multi Factor Authentication challenge. AWS
  Cloudtrail logs provide a a very useful field called `additionalEventData` that
  logs information regarding usage of MFA. This behavior may represent an adversary
  trying to authenticate with compromised credentials for an account that has multi-factor
  authentication enabled.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName= ConsoleLogin errorMessage="Failed authentication"
  additionalEventData.MFAUsed = "Yes" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by src eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode errorMessage userAgent
  eventID awsRegion user_name userIdentity.arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `aws_console_login_failed_during_mfa_challenge_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on is required to utilize this data. The search
  requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: Legitimate users may miss to reply the MFA challenge within
  the time window or deny it by mistake.
