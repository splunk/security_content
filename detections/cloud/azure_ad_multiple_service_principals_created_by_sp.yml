- Azure Active Directory Add service principal
type: Anomaly
status: production
description: The following analytic detects when a single service principal in Azure
  AD creates more than three unique OAuth applications within a 10-minute span. It
  leverages Azure AD audit logs, specifically monitoring the 'Add service principal'
  operation initiated by service principals. This behavior is significant as it may
  indicate an attacker using a compromised or malicious service principal to rapidly
  establish multiple service principals, potentially staging an attack. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could facilitate network infiltration or expansion, allowing
  the attacker to gain unauthorized access and persist within the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Certain users or applications may create multiple service principals
  in a short period of time for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
