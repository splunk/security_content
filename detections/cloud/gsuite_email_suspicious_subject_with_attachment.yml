description: The following analytic identifies Gsuite emails with suspicious subjects
  and attachments commonly used in spear phishing attacks. It leverages Gsuite email
  logs, focusing on specific keywords in the subject line and known malicious file
  types in attachments. This activity is significant for a SOC as spear phishing is
  a prevalent method for initial compromise, often leading to further malicious actions.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could result in unauthorized access, data
  exfiltration, or further malware deployment, posing a significant risk to the organization's
  security.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc.
known_false_positives: normal user or normal transaction may contain the subject and
  file type attachment that this detection try to search.
