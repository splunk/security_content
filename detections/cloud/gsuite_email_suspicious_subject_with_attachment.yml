description: This search is to detect a gsuite email contains suspicious subject having
  known file type used in spear phishing. This technique is a common and effective
  entry vector of attacker to compromise a network by luring the user to click or
  execute the suspicious attachment send from external email account because of the
  effective social engineering of subject related to delivery, bank and so on. On
  the other hand this detection may catch a normal email traffic related to legitimate
  transaction so better to check the email sender, spelling and etc. avoid click link
  or opening the attachment if you are not expecting this type of e-mail.
search: '`gsuite_gmail` num_message_attachments > 0 subject IN ("*dhl*", "* ups *",
  "*delivery*", "*parcel*", "*label*", "*invoice*", "*postal*", "* fedex *", "* usps
  *", "* express *", "*shipment*", "*Banking/Tax*","*shipment*", "*new order*") attachment{}.file_extension_type
  IN ("doc", "docx", "xls", "xlsx", "ppt", "pptx", "pdf", "zip", "rar", "html","htm","hta")
  | rex field=source.from_header_address "[^@]+@(?<source_domain>[^@]+)" | rex field=destination{}.address
  "[^@]+@(?<dest_domain>[^@]+)" | where not source_domain="internal_test_email.com"
  and dest_domain="internal_test_email.com" | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="medium"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(attachment{}.file_extension_type)
  as email_attachments, values(attachment{}.sha256) as attachment_sha256, values(payload_size)
  as payload_size by destination{}.service num_message_attachments  subject destination{}.address
  source.address phase severity | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `gsuite_email_suspicious_subject_with_attachment_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc.
known_false_positives: normal user or normal transaction may contain the subject and
  file type attachment that this detection try to search.
