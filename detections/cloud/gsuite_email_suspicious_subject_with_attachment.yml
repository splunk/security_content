description: The following analytic identifies Gsuite emails with suspicious subjects and attachments commonly used in spear phishing attacks. It leverages Gsuite email logs, focusing on specific keywords in the subject line and known malicious file types in attachments. This activity is significant for a SOC as spear phishing is a prevalent method for initial compromise, often leading to further malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this activity could result in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment, posing a significant risk to the organization's security.
data_source:
- G Suite Gmail
search: '`gsuite_gmail` num_message_attachments > 0 subject IN ("*dhl*", "* ups *", "*delivery*", "*parcel*", "*label*", "*invoice*", "*postal*", "* fedex *", "* usps *", "* express *", "*shipment*", "*Banking/Tax*","*shipment*", "*new order*") attachment{}.file_extension_type IN ("doc", "docx", "xls", "xlsx", "ppt", "pptx", "pdf", "zip", "rar", "html","htm","hta") | rex field=source.from_header_address "[^@]+@(?<source_domain>[^@]+)" | rex field=destination{}.address "[^@]+@(?<dest_domain>[^@]+)" | where not source_domain="internal_test_email.com" and dest_domain="internal_test_email.com" | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="medium" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(attachment{}.file_extension_type) as email_attachments, values(attachment{}.sha256) as attachment_sha256, values(payload_size) as payload_size by destination{}.service num_message_attachments  subject destination{}.address source.address phase severity | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `gsuite_email_suspicious_subject_with_attachment_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc.
known_false_positives: normal user or normal transaction may contain the subject and file type attachment that this detection try to search.
