type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies excessive AccessDenied events within
  an hour timeframe for IAM users in AWS. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to detect
  multiple failed access attempts from the same source IP and user identity. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate that an access key has been compromised
  and is being misused for unauthorized discovery actions. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to gather information about the AWS environment, potentially
  leading to further exploitation or privilege escalation.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail
search: '`cloudtrail` (errorCode = "AccessDenied") user_type=IAMUser (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com)
  | bucket _time span=1h | stats count as failures min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime, dc(eventName) as methods, dc(eventSource) as sources by src_ip, userIdentity.arn,
  _time | where failures >= 5 and methods >= 1 and sources >= 1 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_accessdenied_discovery_events_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible to start this detection will need to be tuned
  by source IP or user. In addition, change the count values to an upper threshold
  to restrict false positives.
