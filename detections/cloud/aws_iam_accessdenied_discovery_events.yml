author: Michael Haag, Splunk
type: Anomaly
datamodel: []
description: The following detection identifies excessive AccessDenied events within
  an hour timeframe. It is possible that an access key to AWS may have been stolen
  and is being misused to perform discovery events. In these instances, the access
  is not available with the key stolen therefore these events will be generated.
search: '`cloudtrail` (errorCode = "AccessDenied") user_type=IAMUser (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com)
  | bucket _time span=1h | stats count as failures min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime, dc(eventName) as methods, dc(eventSource) as sources by src_ip, userIdentity.arn,
  _time | where failures >= 5 and methods >= 1 and sources >= 1 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_accessdenied_discovery_events_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS Cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible to start this detection will need to be tuned
  by source IP or user. In addition, change the count values to an upper threshold
  to restrict false positives.
