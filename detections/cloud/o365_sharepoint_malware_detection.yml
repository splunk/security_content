description: The following analytic identifies when a malicious file is detected within the SharePoint Online ecosystem. Attackers may stage and execute malicious files from within the Microsoft Office 365 ecosystem. Any detections from built-in Office 365 capabilities should be monitored and responded to appropriately. Certain premium Office 365 capabilities further enhance these detection and response functions.
