- O365 Add service principal.
type: Anomaly
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies instances where a single service principal
  creates more than three unique OAuth applications within a 10-minute timeframe.
  It leverages O365 logs from the Unified Audit Log, focusing on the 'Add service
  principal' operation in the Office 365 Azure Active Directory environment. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate a compromised or malicious service principal
  attempting to expand control or access within the network. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized access and potential lateral movement within the
  environment, posing a significant security risk.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Certain users or applications may create multiple service principals
  in a short period of time for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
