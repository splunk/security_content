description: This analytic identifies shell activity within the Kubernetes privilege scope on a worker node, returning a list of shell processes regardless of CPU resource consumption. 
  It uses process metrics from an OTEL collector hostmetrics receiver, pulled from Splunk Observability cloud via the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on. 
  Metrics used are process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization. Shell processes can indicate unauthorized or suspicious activity, posing a security threat. 
  Shell access to worker nodes can provide attackers an entry point to compromise the node and the entire Kubernetes cluster. Monitoring and detecting shell processes is crucial for anomaly identification, security policy enforcement, and breach mitigation.
  Unauthorized shell processes on a Kubernetes worker node can severely compromise the cluster's security and integrity. Such access can lead to data theft, service disruption, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and further attacks within the cluster. 
  It may also enable attackers to manipulate configurations, deploy malicious containers, and execute arbitrary code, posing a severe risk to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of applications and sensitive data.

how_to_implement: 'To implement this detection, follow these steps:
  1. Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.
  2. Enable the hostmetrics/process receiver in the OTEL configuration.
  3. Ensure that the process metrics, specifically Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization, are enabled.
  4. Install the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on.(ref: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247)
  5. Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access Token.
  6. Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input "sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index".
  7. In the SIM configuration, set the Organization ID to your Observability Cloud Organization ID.
  8. Set the Signal Flow Program to the following: data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''A''); data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''B''); data(''process.cpu.time'').publish(label=''C''); data(''process.disk.io'').publish(label=''D''); data(''process.memory.usage'').publish(label=''E''); data(''process.memory.virtual'').publish(label=''F''); data(''process.memory.utilization'').publish(label=''G''); data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''H''); data(''process.disk.operations'').publish(label=''I''); data(''process.handles'').publish(label=''J''); data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''K'')
  9. Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.
  10. Leave all other settings at their default values.'
