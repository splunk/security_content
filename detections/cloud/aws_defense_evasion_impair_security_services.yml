description: The following analytic detects attempts to delete critical AWS security
  service configurations, such as CloudWatch alarms, GuardDuty detectors, and Web
  Application Firewall rules. It leverages CloudTrail logs to identify specific API
  calls like "DeleteLogStream" and "DeleteDetector." This activity is significant
  because it indicates potential efforts to disable security monitoring and evade
  detection. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to operate undetected,
  escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data without triggering security alerts, severely
  compromising the security posture of the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteLogStream
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteDetector
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteIPSet
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteWebACL
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteRule
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteRuleGroup
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteLoggingConfiguration
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteAlarms

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in
  your AWS Environment.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that it is a legitimate admin activity. Please consider filtering out these noisy
  events using userAgent, user_arn field names.
