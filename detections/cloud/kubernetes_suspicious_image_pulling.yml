description: The following analytic detects suspicious image pulling in Kubernetes environments. It identifies this activity by monitoring Kubernetes audit logs for image pull requests that do not match a predefined list of allowed images. This behavior is significant for a SOC as it may indicate an attacker attempting to deploy malicious software or infiltrate the system. If confirmed malicious, the impact could be severe, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data, and enabling further malicious activities within the cluster.
data_source:
- Kubernetes Audit
search: '`kube_audit` requestObject.message="Pulling image*" | search NOT `kube_allowed_images` | fillnull | stats count by objectRef.name objectRef.namespace objectRef.resource requestReceivedTimestamp requestURI responseStatus.code sourceIPs{} stage user.groups{} user.uid user.username userAgent verb | rename sourceIPs{} as src_ip, user.username as user | `kubernetes_suspicious_image_pulling_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities. Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server. Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md. When you want to use this detection with AWS EKS, you need to enable EKS control plane logging https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html. Then you can collect the logs from Cloudwatch using the AWS TA https://splunk.github.io/splunk-add-on-for-amazon-web-services/CloudWatchLogs/.
