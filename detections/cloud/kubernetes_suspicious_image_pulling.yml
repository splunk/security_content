description: 'The following analytic detects instances of suspicious image pulling in Kubernetes. 
  It identifies this behavior by monitoring Kubernetes audit logs for image pull requests that do not match a predefined list of allowed images. 
  This behavior is worth identifying for a SOC as it could indicate an attacker attempting to deploy malicious software or infiltrate the system. 
  The impact of such an attack could be severe, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.
  Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
  Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server.
  Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
