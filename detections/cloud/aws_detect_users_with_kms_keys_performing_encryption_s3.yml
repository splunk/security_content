description: This search provides detection of users with KMS keys performing encryption specifically against S3 buckets.
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with cloudtrail logs
id: 884a5f59-eec7-4f4a-948b-dbde18225fdc
known_false_positives: Not all operations with KMS keys are malicious.  It is very unusual to create a key to encrypt only and not to decrypt. This search compliments the creation of KMS keys with encrypt policy.
