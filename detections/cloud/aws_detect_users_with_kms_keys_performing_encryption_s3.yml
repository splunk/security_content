type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies users with KMS keys performing encryption
  operations on S3 buckets. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to detect the `CopyObject`
  event where server-side encryption with AWS KMS is specified. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate unauthorized or suspicious encryption of data, potentially masking
  exfiltration or tampering efforts. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could be
  encrypting sensitive data to evade detection or preparing it for exfiltration, posing
  a significant risk to data integrity and confidentiality.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=CopyObject requestParameters.x-amz-server-side-encryption="aws:kms"
  | rename requestParameters.bucketName AS bucketName, requestParameters.x-amz-copy-source
  AS src_file, requestParameters.key AS dest_file | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(bucketName) as bucketName values(src_file) AS src_file
  values(dest_file) AS dest_file values(userAgent) AS userAgent values(region) AS
  region values(src) AS src by user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |`aws_detect_users_with_kms_keys_performing_encryption_s3_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs
known_false_positives: There maybe buckets provisioned with S3 encryption
