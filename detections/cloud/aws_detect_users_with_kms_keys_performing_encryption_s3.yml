description: This search provides detection of users with KMS keys performing encryption
  specifically against S3 buckets.
data_source: []
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=CopyObject requestParameters.x-amz-server-side-encryption="aws:kms"
  | rename requestParameters.bucketName AS bucketName, requestParameters.x-amz-copy-source
  AS src_file, requestParameters.key AS dest_file | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(bucketName) as bucketName values(src_file) AS src_file
  values(dest_file) AS dest_file values(userAgent) AS userAgent values(region) AS
  region values(src) AS src by user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |`aws_detect_users_with_kms_keys_performing_encryption_s3_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs
known_false_positives: There maybe buckets provisioned with S3 encryption
