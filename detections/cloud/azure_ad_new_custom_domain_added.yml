description: The following analytic detects the addition of a new custom domain within
  an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. It leverages Azure AD AuditLogs to identify
  successful "Add unverified domain" operations. This activity is significant as it
  may indicate an adversary attempting to establish persistence by setting up identity
  federation backdoors, allowing them to impersonate users and bypass authentication
  mechanisms. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to gain unauthorized
  access, escalate privileges, and maintain long-term access to the Azure AD environment,
  posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Add unverified domain
search: ' `azure_monitor_aad`  operationName="Add unverified domain" properties.result=success
  | rename properties.* as * | rename targetResources{}.displayName as domain | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by user, domain, result, operationName,
  src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `azure_ad_new_custom_domain_added_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: In most organizations, new customm domains will be updated
  infrequently. Filter as needed.
