description: The following analytic identifies the creation of containerized workloads
  using previously unseen images in a Kubernetes cluster. It leverages process metrics
  from an OTEL collector and Kubernetes cluster receiver, pulled from Splunk Observability
  Cloud. The detection compares container image names seen in the last hour with those
  from the previous 30 days. This activity is significant as unfamiliar container
  images may introduce vulnerabilities, malware, or misconfigurations, posing threats
  to the cluster's integrity. If confirmed malicious, compromised images can lead
  to data breaches, service disruptions, unauthorized access, and potential lateral
  movement within the cluster.

how_to_implement: 'To implement this detection, follow these steps: 
  
  * Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.

  * Enable the hostmetrics/process receiver in the OTEL configuration.

  * Ensure that the process metrics, specifically Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization,
  are enabled.

  * Install the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on. (ref: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247)

  * Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access
  Token.

  * Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input "sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index".

  * In the SIM configuration, set the Organization ID to your Observability Cloud
  Organization ID.

  * Set the Signal Flow Program to the following: data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''A'');
  data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''B''); data(''process.cpu.time'').publish(label=''C'');
  data(''process.disk.io'').publish(label=''D''); data(''process.memory.usage'').publish(label=''E'');
  data(''process.memory.virtual'').publish(label=''F''); data(''process.memory.utilization'').publish(label=''G'');
  data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''H''); data(''process.disk.operations'').publish(label=''I'');
  data(''process.handles'').publish(label=''J''); data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''K'')

  * Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.

  * Leave all other settings at their default values.

  * Run the Search Baseline Of Kubernetes Container Network IO Ratio '
