description: This detection  targets activities where the results of a content search within the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center are exported, a crucial phase in the compliance and investigative workflows. By focusing on the SearchExported operation logged under the SecurityComplianceCenter workload in the o365_management_activity, this analytic flags instances that potentially move sensitive or critical organizational data outside its original storage locations.
search: ' `o365_management_activity`  Workload=SecurityComplianceCenter Operation="SearchExported"
  | rename user_id as user
  | stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime by Operation, ObjectId, ExchangeLocations, user, Query  |`security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_compliance_content_search_exported_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Compliance content searche exports may be executed for legitimate purposes, filter as needed.
