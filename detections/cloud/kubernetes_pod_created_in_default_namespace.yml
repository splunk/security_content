description: The following analytic detects the creation of Kubernetes pods in the
  default, kube-system, or kube-public namespaces. It leverages Kubernetes audit logs
  to identify pod creation events within these specific namespaces. This activity
  is significant for a SOC as it may indicate an attacker attempting to hide their
  presence or evade defenses. Unauthorized pod creation in these namespaces can suggest
  a successful cluster breach, potentially leading to privilege escalation, persistent
  access, or further malicious activities within the cluster.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.
  Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
  Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server.
  Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
