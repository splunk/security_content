description: The following analytic detects the creation of pods in the default, kube-system, or kube-public namespaces. 
  It identifies this behavior by monitoring Kubernetes audit logs for pod creation events in these namespaces. 
  This behavior is worth identifying for a SOC as it may indicate an attacker attempting to hide their presence or evade defenses. 
  Only administrators should typically create pods in the kube-system namespace, and the default and kube-public namespaces should not be used in production. 
  The impact of the attack could be significant, as it may indicate a successful cluster breach and ongoing malicious activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.
  Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
  Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server.
  Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
