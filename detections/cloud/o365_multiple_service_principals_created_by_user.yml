type: Anomaly
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies instances where a single user creates
  more than three unique OAuth applications within a 10-minute window in the Office
  365 environment. It leverages O365 logs from the Unified Audit Log, focusing on
  the 'Add service principal' operation in Azure Active Directory. This activity is
  significant as it may indicate a compromised user account or unauthorized actions,
  potentially leading to broader network infiltration or privilege escalation. If
  confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to gain persistent access,
  escalate privileges, or exfiltrate sensitive information.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Certain users or applications may create multiple service principals
  in a short period of time for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
