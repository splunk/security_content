description: The following analytic detects unauthorized container uploads to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECR) by monitoring AWS CloudTrail events. 
  It identifies instances where a new container is uploaded by a user not previously recognized as authorized. This detection is crucial for a SOC 
  as it can indicate a potential compromise or misuse of AWS ECR, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or the deployment of 
  malicious containers. By identifying and investigating these events, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches or other security 
  incidents resulting from unauthorized container uploads. The impact of such an attack could be significant, compromising the integrity and 
  security of the organization's cloud environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
