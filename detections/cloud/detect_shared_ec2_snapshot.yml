description: The following analytic utilizes AWS CloudTrail events to identify when
  an EC2 snapshot permissions are modified to be shared with a different AWS account.
  This method is used by adversaries to exfiltrate the EC2 snapshot.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ModifySnapshotAttribute | rename requestParameters.createVolumePermission.add.items{}.userId
  as requested_account_id | search requested_account_id != NULL | eval match=if(requested_account_id==aws_account_id,"Match","No
  Match") | table _time user_arn src_ip requestParameters.attributeType requested_account_id
  aws_account_id match vendor_region user_agent | where match = "No Match" | `detect_shared_ec2_snapshot_filter` '
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately shared a
  snapshot with others for  a specific purpose.
