description: This search detects the creation of a new Federation setting by alerting
  about an specific event related to its creation.
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory Operation="Add app
  role assignment grant to user." | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(Actor{}.ID) as Actor.ID values(Actor{}.Type) as Actor.Type by
  ActorIpAddress dest ResultStatus | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_add_app_role_assignment_grant_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: The creation of a new Federation is not necessarily malicious,
  however this events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential
  abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a different cloud provider.
