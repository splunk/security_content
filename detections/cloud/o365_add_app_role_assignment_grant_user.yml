description: The following analytic detects the addition of an application role assignment
  grant to a user in Office 365. It leverages data from the `o365_management_activity`
  dataset, specifically monitoring the "Add app role assignment grant to user" operation.
  This activity is significant as it can indicate unauthorized privilege escalation
  or the assignment of sensitive roles to users. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow an attacker to gain elevated permissions, potentially leading to unauthorized
  access to critical resources and data within the Office 365 environment.

- O365 Add app role assignment grant to user.
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory Operation="Add app
  role assignment grant to user." | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(Actor{}.ID) as Actor.ID values(Actor{}.Type) as Actor.Type values(ModifiedProperties{}.Name)

how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: The creation of a new Federation is not necessarily malicious,
  however this events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential
  abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a different cloud provider.
