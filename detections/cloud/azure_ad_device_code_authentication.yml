description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the Azure Device Code Phishing attack, 
  which can lead to Azure Account Take-Over (ATO). The detection leverages Azure AD logs specifically 
  focusing on authentication requests to identify the attack. This technique involves creating malicious 
  infrastructure, bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and bypassing Conditional Access Policies (CAPs). 
  The attack aims to compromise users by sending them phishing emails from attacker-controlled domains and trick 
  the victims into performing OAuth 2.0 device authentication. A successful execution of this attack can result 
  in adversaries gaining unauthorized access to Azure AD, Exchange mailboxes, and the target's Outlook Web Application (OWA). 
  This attack technique was detailed by security researchers including Bobby Cooke, Stephan Borosh, and others. 
  It's crucial for organizations to be aware of this threat, as it can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: In most organizations, device code authentication will be used to access common Microsoft service but it may be legitimate for others. Filter as needed.
