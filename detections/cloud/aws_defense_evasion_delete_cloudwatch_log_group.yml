description: This analytic identifies AWS `DeleteLogGroup` events in CloudTrail logs.
  Attackers may evade the logging capability by deleting the log group in CloudWatch.
  This will stop sending the logs and metrics to CloudWatch. When the adversary has
  the right type of permissions within the compromised AWS environment, they may delete
  the CloudWatch log group that is logging activities in the environment.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteLogGroup
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = DeleteLogGroup eventSource = logs.amazonaws.com
  userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com errorCode = success| stats count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.logGroupName) as log_group_name
  by src region eventName userAgent user_arn aws_account_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `aws_defense_evasion_delete_cloudwatch_log_group_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in
  your AWS Environment.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has deleted CloudWatch logging. Please investigate this activity.
