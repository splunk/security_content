description: This analytic identifies `UpdateTrail` events in CloudTrail logs. Attackers may evade the logging capability by updating the settings and impairing 
  them with wrong parameters. For example, Attackers may change the multi-regional log into a single region logs, which evades the logging for other regions. 
  When the adversary has the right type of permissions in the compromised AWS environment, they may update the CloudTrail settings that is logging activities 
  in your environment.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = UpdateTrail eventSource = cloudtrail.amazonaws.com userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com errorCode = success| stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.name) as cloudtrail_name by src region eventName userAgent user_arn aws_account_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `aws_defense_evasion_update_cloudtrail_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in
  your AWS Environment.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has updated cloudtrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
