how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Instance
  Types - Initial` to build the initial table of instance types observed and times.
  You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Instance
  Types - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also
  provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_with_previously_unseen_instance_type_filter`
  macro.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an admin will create a new system using
  a new instance type that has never been used before. Verify with the creator that
  they intended to create the system with the new instance type.
