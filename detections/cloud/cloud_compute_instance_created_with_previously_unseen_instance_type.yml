description: The following analytic detects the creation of EC2 instances with previously
  unseen instance types. It leverages Splunk's tstats command to analyze data from
  the Change data model, identifying instance types that have not been previously
  recorded. This activity is significant for a SOC because it may indicate unauthorized
  or suspicious activity, such as an attacker attempting to create instances for malicious
  purposes. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration,
  system compromise, or service disruption. Immediate investigation is required to
  determine the legitimacy of the instance creation.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTime, latest(_time) as lastTime values(All_Changes.object_id)
  as dest, count from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.action=created by All_Changes.Instance_Changes.instance_type,
  All_Changes.user | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | `drop_dm_object_name("Instance_Changes")`
  | where instance_type != "unknown" | lookup previously_seen_cloud_compute_instance_types

  max(enough_data) as enough_data | where enough_data=1 | eval firstTimeSeenInstanceType=min(firstTimeSeen)
  | where isnull(firstTimeSeenInstanceType) OR firstTimeSeenInstanceType > relative_time(now(),
  "-24h@h") | table firstTime, user, dest, count, instance_type | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `cloud_compute_instance_created_with_previously_unseen_instance_type_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Instance
  Types - Initial` to build the initial table of instance types observed and times.
  You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Instance
  Types - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also
  provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_with_previously_unseen_instance_type_filter`
  macro.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an admin will create a new system using
  a new instance type that has never been used before. Verify with the creator that
  they intended to create the system with the new instance type.
