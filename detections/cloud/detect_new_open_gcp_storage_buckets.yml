description: This search looks for GCP PubSub events where a user has created an open/public
  GCP Storage bucket.
how_to_implement: This search relies on the Splunk Add-on for Google Cloud Platform,
  setting up a Cloud Pub/Sub input, along with the relevant GCP PubSub topics and
  logging sink to capture GCP Storage Bucket events (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/overview).

known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that a GCP admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose.
  That said, GCP strongly advises against granting full control to the "allUsers"
  group.
