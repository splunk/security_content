description: The following analytic identifies the creation of new open/public GCP
  Storage buckets. It leverages GCP PubSub events, specifically monitoring for the
  `storage.setIamPermissions` method and checks if the `allUsers` member is added.
  This activity is significant because open storage buckets can expose sensitive data
  to the public, posing a severe security risk. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could access, modify, or delete data within the bucket, leading to data breaches
  and potential compliance violations.

how_to_implement: This search relies on the Splunk Add-on for Google Cloud Platform,
  setting up a Cloud Pub/Sub input, along with the relevant GCP PubSub topics and
  logging sink to capture GCP Storage Bucket events (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/overview).
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that a GCP admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose.
  That said, GCP strongly advises against granting full control to the "allUsers"
  group.
