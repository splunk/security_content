name: AWS Concurrent Sessions From Different Ips

description: The following analytic identifies an AWS IAM account with concurrent
  sessions originating from more than one unique IP address within a 5-minute window.
  It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs, specifically the `DescribeEventAggregates` event,
  to detect this behavior. This activity is significant as it may indicate a session
  hijacking attack, where an adversary uses stolen session cookies to access AWS resources
  from a different location. If confirmed malicious, this could allow unauthorized
  access to sensitive corporate resources, leading to potential data breaches or further
  exploitation within the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail DescribeEventAggregates
search: ' `cloudtrail` eventName = DescribeEventAggregates src_ip!="AWS Internal"
  | bin span=5m _time | stats values(userAgent) values(eventName) values(src_ip) as
  src_ip  dc(src_ip) as distinct_ip_count by _time user_arn | where distinct_ip_count
  > 1 | `aws_concurrent_sessions_from_different_ips_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also
  represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize
  the threshold to fit your environment.
