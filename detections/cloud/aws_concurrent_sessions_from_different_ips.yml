description: The following analytic identifies an AWS IAM account with concurrent
  sessions coming from more than one unique IP address within the span of 5 minutes.
  This behavior could represent a session hijacking attack whereby an adversary has
  extracted cookies from a victims browser and is using them from a different location
  to access corporate online resources. When a user navigates the AWS Console after
  authentication, the API call with the event name `DescribeEventAggregates` is registered
  in the AWS CloudTrail logs. The Splunk Threat Research team leveraged this event
  name to identify 2 concurrent sessions. The presence of this event occurring from
  two different IP addresses is highly unlikely. As users may behave differently across
  organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their
  environments.
data_source: []
search: ' `cloudtrail` eventName = DescribeEventAggregates src_ip!="AWS Internal"
  | bin span=5m _time | stats values(userAgent) values(eventName) values(src_ip) as
  src_ip  dc(src_ip) as distinct_ip_count by _time user_arn | where distinct_ip_count
  > 1 | `aws_concurrent_sessions_from_different_ips_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also
  represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize
  the threshold to fit your environment.
