description: The following analytic identifies an AWS  account with concurrent sessions coming from more than one unique IP address within the span of 5 minutes. In AWS, when a user is navigating the AWS Console, we observed an API call - `DescribeEventAggregates` being registered in the cloudtrail log. This behavior could represent a session hijacking attack whereby an adversary has extracted cookies from a victims browser and is using them from a different location to access corporate online resources. As users may behave differently across organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments. The presence of this event occuring fromm two different IP addresses is highly unlikely
search: ' `cloudtrail` eventName = DescribeEventAggregates src_ip!="AWS Internal" 
| bin span=5m _time 
| stats values(userAgent) values(eventName) values(src_ip) as src_ip  dc(src_ip) as distinct_ip_count by _time user_arn 
| where distinct_ip_count > 1 
  | `aws_concurrent_sessions_from_different_ips_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
