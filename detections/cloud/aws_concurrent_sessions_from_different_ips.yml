description: The following analytic identifies an AWS IAM account with concurrent sessions coming from more than one unique IP address within the span of 5 minutes. 
  This behavior could represent a session hijacking attack whereby an adversary has extracted cookies from a victims browser and is using them from a different location to access corporate
  online resources. When a user navigates the AWS Console after authentication, the API call with the event name `DescribeEventAggregates` is registered in the AWS CloudTrail logs. The Splunk Threat Research team leveraged
  this event name to identify 2 concurrent sessions. The presence of this event occurring from two different IP addresses is highly unlikely.
  As users may behave differently across organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments. 
search: ' `cloudtrail` eventName = DescribeEventAggregates src_ip!="AWS Internal" 
  | bin span=5m _time 
  | stats values(userAgent) values(eventName) values(src_ip) as src_ip  dc(src_ip) as distinct_ip_count by _time user_arn 
  | where distinct_ip_count > 1 
  | `aws_concurrent_sessions_from_different_ips_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
