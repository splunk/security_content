type: Baseline
datamodel:
- Authentication
description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user logs into the console,
  then creates a baseline of the latest and earliest times, City, Region, and Country
  we have encountered this user in our dataset, grouped by username, within the last
  30 days.
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Authentication
  where Authentication.signature=ConsoleLogin by Authentication.user Authentication.src
  | iplocation Authentication.src | rename Authentication.user as user Authentication.src
  as src | table user src City Region Country firstTime lastTime | outputlookup previously_seen_users_console_logins
  | stats count'
how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version
  5.1.0 or later) and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates
  to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Validate the user name entries
  in `previously_seen_users_console_logins`, which is a lookup file created by this
  support search.
