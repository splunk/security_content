description: This detection focuses on identifying changes in mailbox folder permissions within an Office 365 environment, specifically pinpointing instances where read permissions are granted. It monitors for two key operations Set-MailboxFolderPermission and Add-MailboxFolderPermission, as logged in the o365_management_activity. These operations are indicative of modifications or additions to the permissions of mailbox folders, potentially altering who can view or interact with the folder contents.
search: ' `o365_management_activity` Workload=Exchange (Operation="Set-MailboxFolderPermission" OR Operation="Add-MailboxFolderPermission" )
  | eval isReadRole=if(match(AccessRights, "^(ReadItems|Author|NonEditingAuthor|Owner|PublishingAuthor|Reviewer)$"), "true", "false") 
  | search isReadRole="true"
  | rename UserId as user
  | stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime by Operation, user, Identity, AccessRights 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `o365_mailbox_folder_read_permission_granted_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Mailbox folder permissions may be configured for legitimate purposes, filter as needed.
