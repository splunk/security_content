description: The following analytic identifies instances where read permissions are granted to mailbox folders within an Office 365 environment. It detects this activity by monitoring the `o365_management_activity` data source for the `Set-MailboxFolderPermission` and `Add-MailboxFolderPermission` operations. This behavior is significant as it may indicate unauthorized access or changes to mailbox folder permissions, potentially exposing sensitive email content. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to read email communications, leading to data breaches or information leakage.
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=Exchange (Operation="Set-MailboxFolderPermission" OR Operation="Add-MailboxFolderPermission" ) | eval isReadRole=if(match(AccessRights, "^(ReadItems|Author|NonEditingAuthor|Owner|PublishingAuthor|Reviewer)$"), "true", "false") | search isReadRole="true" | rename UserId as user | stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime by Operation, user, Identity, AccessRights | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `o365_mailbox_folder_read_permission_granted_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Mailbox folder permissions may be configured for legitimate purposes, filter as needed.
