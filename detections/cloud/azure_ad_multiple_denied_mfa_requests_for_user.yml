- Azure Active Directory Sign-in activity
description: The following analytic detects an unusually high number of denied Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requests for a single user within a 10-minute window, specifically when more than nine MFA prompts are declined. It leverages Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign-in logs, focusing on "Sign-in activity" events with error code 500121 and additional details indicating "MFA denied; user declined the authentication." This behavior is significant as it may indicate a targeted attack or account compromise attempt, with the user actively declining unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, it could lead to data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further malicious activities.
search: '`azure_monitor_aad` category=SignInLogs operationName="Sign-in activity" | rename properties.* as * | search status.errorCode=500121 status.additionalDetails="MFA denied; user declined the authentication" | bucket span=10m _time | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by user, status.additionalDetails, appDisplayName, user_agent | where count > 9 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `azure_ad_multiple_denied_mfa_requests_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Multiple denifed MFA requests in a short period of span may also be a sign of authentication errors. Investigate and filter as needed.
