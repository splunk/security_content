- Azure Active Directory Sign-in activity
description: The following analytic detects an unusually high number of denied Multi-Factor
  Authentication (MFA) requests for a single user within a 10-minute window, specifically
  when more than nine MFA prompts are declined. It leverages Azure Active Directory
  (Azure AD) sign-in logs, focusing on "Sign-in activity" events with error code 500121
  and additional details indicating "MFA denied; user declined the authentication."
  This behavior is significant as it may indicate a targeted attack or account compromise
  attempt, with the user actively declining unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious,
  it could lead to data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further malicious activities.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Multiple denifed MFA requests in a short period of span may
  also be a sign of authentication errors. Investigate and filter as needed.
