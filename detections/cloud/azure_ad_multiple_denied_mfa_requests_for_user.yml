description: This analytic targets the detection of an unusually high number of denied Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requests for a single user within a 10-minute window, specifically identifying instances where more than nine MFA prompts were declined by the user. Utilizing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign-in logs, particularly focusing on "Sign-in activity" events, it filters for scenarios where the MFA request was denied due to the user declining the authentication, as indicated by error code 500121 and additional details stating "MFA denied; user declined the authentication." The data is then aggregated into 10-minute intervals, counting distinct raw events and capturing the earliest and latest times of occurrence for each user. This behavior is significant for a Security Operations Center (SOC) as it could be an early indicator of a targeted attack or an account compromise attempt, with an attacker having obtained the user's credentials and the user actively declining the MFA prompts, preventing unauthorized access. A true positive detection would imply that an attacker is on the verge of gaining full access to the user's account, posing a threat that could lead to data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further malicious activities within the organization, necessitating immediate investigation and response to safeguard the organization's assets.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Multiple denifed MFA requests in a short period of span may also be a sign of authentication errors. Investigate and filter as needed.
