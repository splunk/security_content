description: This analytic identifies AWS `DeleteTrail` events within CloudTrail logs. Adversaries often try to impair their target's defenses by stopping their malicious activity from being logged, so that they may operate with stealth and avoid detection. When the adversary has the right type of permissions in the compromised AWS environment, they may delete the the entire cloudtrail that is logging activities in the environment. 
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = DeleteTrail eventSource = cloudtrail.amazonaws.com userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com errorCode = success| stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.name) as deleted_cloudtrail_name by src region eventName userAgent user_arn aws_account_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `aws_defense_evasion_delete_cloudtrail_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in
  your AWS Environment.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has stopped cloudTrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
