description: The following analytic detects the deletion of AWS CloudTrail logs by identifying `DeleteTrail` events within CloudTrail logs. This detection leverages CloudTrail data to monitor for successful `DeleteTrail` actions, excluding those initiated from the AWS console. This activity is significant because adversaries may delete CloudTrail logs to evade detection and operate stealthily within the compromised environment. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace their activities and potentially leading to prolonged unauthorized access and further exploitation.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteTrail
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = DeleteTrail eventSource = cloudtrail.amazonaws.com userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com errorCode = success| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.name) as deleted_cloudtrail_name by src region eventName userAgent user_arn aws_account_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `aws_defense_evasion_delete_cloudtrail_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in your AWS Environment.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has stopped cloudTrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
