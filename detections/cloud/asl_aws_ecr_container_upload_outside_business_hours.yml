description: The following analytic detects the upload of new containers to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECR) outside of standard business hours 
  through AWS CloudTrail events. It identifies this behavior by monitoring for `PutImage` events occurring before 8 AM or after 8 PM, 
  as well as any uploads on weekends. This activity is significant for a SOC to investigate as it may indicate unauthorized access or malicious 
  deployments, potentially leading to compromised services or data breaches. Identifying and addressing such uploads promptly can mitigate the 
  risk of security incidents and their associated impacts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: When your development is spreaded in different time zones,
  applying this rule can be difficult.
