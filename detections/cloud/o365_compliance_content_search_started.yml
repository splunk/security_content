description: This detection will trigger when a content search is initiated within the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center, a critical component in the suite's governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) capabilities. By monitoring the SearchCreated operation within the o365_management_activity logs, specifically under the SecurityComplianceCenter workload, this analytic flags the commencement of searches across the organization's data, including emails, documents, and more, that reside in ExchangeLocations.
search: ' `o365_management_activity` Workload=SecurityComplianceCenter Operation=SearchCreated
  | rename user_id as user 
  | stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime by Operation, ObjectId, ExchangeLocations, user, Query  |`security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_compliance_content_search_started_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Compliance content searches may be executed for legitimate purposes, filter as needed.
