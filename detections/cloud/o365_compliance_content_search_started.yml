description: The following analytic detects when a content search is initiated within
  the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center. It leverages the SearchCreated operation
  from the o365_management_activity logs under the SecurityComplianceCenter workload.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to access sensitive organizational
  data, including emails and documents. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  unauthorized data access, potential data exfiltration, and compliance violations.
  Monitoring this behavior helps ensure the integrity and security of organizational
  data.
search: ' `o365_management_activity` Workload=SecurityComplianceCenter Operation=SearchCreated
  | rename user_id as user | stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time)
  as lastTime by Operation, ObjectId, ExchangeLocations, user, Query  |`security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `o365_compliance_content_search_started_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Compliance content searches may be executed for legitimate
  purposes, filter as needed.
