name: AWS Unusual Number of Failed Authentications From Ip

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies one source IP failing to authenticate
  into the AWS Console with multiple valid users. This behavior could represent an
  adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an AWS environment to obtain
  initial access or elevate privileges. The detection calculates the standard deviation
  for source IP and leverages the 3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual
  number of failed authentication attempts. To customize this analytic, users can
  try different combinations of the bucket span time and the calculation of the upperBound
  field. This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat
  hunting exercises. While looking for anomalies using statistical methods like the
  standard deviation can have benefits, we also recommend using threshold-based detections
  to complement coverage. A similar analytic following the threshold model is `AWS
  Multiple Users Failing To Authenticate From Ip`.
data_source: []
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats  dc(_raw) AS unique_accounts values(user_name) as tried_accounts by _time,

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-on for AWS in order to ingest Cloudtrail.
  We recommend the users to try different combinations of the bucket span time and
  the calculation of the upperBound field to tune this search according to their environment
known_false_positives: No known false postives for this detection. Please review this
