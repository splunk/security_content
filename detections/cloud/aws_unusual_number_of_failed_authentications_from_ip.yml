name: AWS Unusual Number of Failed Authentications From Ip
id: 0b5c9c2b-e2cb-4831-b4f1-af125ceb1386

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a single source IP failing to authenticate
  into the AWS Console with multiple valid users. It uses CloudTrail logs and calculates
  the standard deviation for source IP, leveraging the 3-sigma rule to detect unusual
  numbers of failed authentication attempts. This behavior is significant as it may
  indicate a Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial
  access or elevate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to
  unauthorized access, data breaches, or further exploitation within the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats  dc(_raw) AS distinct_attempts values(user_name) as tried_accounts by _time,
  src_ip | eventstats  avg(distinct_attempts) as avg_attempts , stdev(distinct_attempts)
  as ip_std by _time | eval  upperBound=(avg_attempts+ip_std*3) | eval  isOutlier=if(distinct_attempts
  > 10 and distinct_attempts >= upperBound, 1, 0) | where isOutlier = 1 |`aws_unusual_number_of_failed_authentications_from_ip_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-on for AWS in order to ingest Cloudtrail.
  We recommend the users to try different combinations of the bucket span time and
  the calculation of the upperBound field to tune this search according to their environment
known_false_positives: No known false postives for this detection. Please review this
