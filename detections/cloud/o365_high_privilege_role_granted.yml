- O365 Add member to role.
description: The following analytic detects when high-privilege roles such as "Exchange Administrator," "SharePoint Administrator," or "Global Administrator" are granted within Office 365. It leverages O365 audit logs to identify events where these roles are assigned to any user or service account. This activity is significant for SOCs as these roles provide extensive permissions, allowing broad access and control over critical resources and data. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to gain significant control over O365 resources, access, modify, or delete critical data, and compromise the overall security and functionality of the O365 environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Privilege roles may be assigned for legitimate purposes, filter as needed.
