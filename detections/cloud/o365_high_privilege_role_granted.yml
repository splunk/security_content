- O365 Add member to role.
description: The following analytic detects when high-privilege roles such as "Exchange
  Administrator," "SharePoint Administrator," or "Global Administrator" are granted
  within Office 365. It leverages O365 audit logs to identify events where these roles
  are assigned to any user or service account. This activity is significant for SOCs
  as these roles provide extensive permissions, allowing broad access and control
  over critical resources and data. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers
  to gain significant control over O365 resources, access, modify, or delete critical
  data, and compromise the overall security and functionality of the O365 environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Privilege roles may be assigned for legitimate purposes, filter
  as needed.
