description: This search will detect a spike in the number of API calls made to your
  cloud infrastructure environment about security groups by a user.
search: '| tstats count as security_group_api_calls values(All_Changes.command) as
  command from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.object_category=firewall AND All_Changes.status=success
  by All_Changes.user _time span=1h | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | eval
  HourOfDay=strftime(_time, "%H") | eval HourOfDay=floor(HourOfDay/4)*4 | eval DayOfWeek=strftime(_time,
  "%w") | eval isWeekend=if(DayOfWeek >= 1 AND DayOfWeek <= 5, 0, 1) | join user HourOfDay
  isWeekend [ summary cloud_excessive_security_group_api_calls_v1] | where cardinality
  >=16 | apply cloud_excessive_security_group_api_calls_v1 threshold=0.005 | rename
  "IsOutlier(security_group_api_calls)" as isOutlier | where isOutlier=1 | eval expected_upper_threshold

  - expected_upper_threshold | table _time, user, command, security_group_api_calls,
  expected_upper_threshold, distance_from_threshold | `abnormally_high_number_of_cloud_security_group_api_calls_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs. You also must
  run the baseline search `Baseline Of Cloud Security Group API Calls Per User` to
  create the probability density function model.
