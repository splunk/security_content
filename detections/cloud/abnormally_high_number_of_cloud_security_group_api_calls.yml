name: Abnormally High Number Of Cloud Security Group API Calls

description: The following analytic detects a spike in the number of API calls made
  to cloud security groups by a user. It leverages data from the Change data model,
  focusing on successful firewall-related changes. This activity is significant because
  an abnormal increase in security group API calls can indicate potential malicious
  activity, such as unauthorized access or configuration changes. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to manipulate security group settings, potentially
  exposing sensitive resources or disrupting network security controls.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs. You also must
  run the baseline search `Baseline Of Cloud Security Group API Calls Per User` to
  create the probability density function model.
