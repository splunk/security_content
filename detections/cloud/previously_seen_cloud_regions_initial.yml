author: David Dorsey, Splunk
type: Baseline
datamodel:
- Change
description: This search looks for cloud compute events where a compute instance is
  started and creates a baseline of most recent time, `lastTime` and the first time
  `firstTime` we've seen this region in our dataset grouped by the region for the
  last 30 days
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTimeSeen, latest(_time) as lastTimeSeen
  from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.action=created by All_Changes.vendor_region
  | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | eventstats min(firstTimeSeen) as globalFirstTime
  | eval enough_data = if(globalFirstTime <= relative_time(now(), "-14d@d"), 1, 0)
  | outputlookup previously_seen_cloud_regions'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting the approrpiate cloud infrastructure logs
  and have the Security Research cloud data model installed.
