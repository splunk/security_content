- Azure Active Directory Add app role assignment to service principal
type: TTP
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies instances where a service principal
  in Azure Active Directory assigns app roles without standard admin consent. It uses
  Entra ID logs from the `azure_monitor_aad` data source, focusing on the "Add app
  role assignment to service principal" operation. This detection is significant as
  it highlights potential bypasses of critical administrative consent processes, which
  could lead to unauthorized privileges being granted. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could allow attackers to exploit automation to assign sensitive permissions
  without proper oversight, potentially compromising the security of the Azure AD
  environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the Auditlog log category
known_false_positives: Service Principals are sometimes configured to legitimately
  bypass the consent process for purposes of automation. Filter as needed.
