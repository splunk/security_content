- Azure Active Directory Add app role assignment to service principal
type: TTP
status: production
description: This detection focuses on identifying instances in Azure Active Directory where a service principal assigns app roles without standard admin consent, using Entra ID logs. It operates on the azure_monitor_aad data source, scrutinizing the "Add app role assignment to service principal" operation, specifically from service principals. The query dissects details such as role ID, value, and description, important for understanding the nature of the roles being assigned. Monitoring this in a SOC is critical as it flags potential bypasses of vital administrative consent processes in Azure AD, which could result in unauthorized privileges being granted. A true positive detection suggests that a service principal may be exploiting automation to assign sensitive permissions without proper oversight.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Auditlog log category
known_false_positives: Service Principals are sometimes configured to legitimately bypass the consent process for purposes of automation. Filter as needed.
