description: The following analytic identifies when a user with sufficient access to O365 Security & Compliance portal uses premium investigation features (Threat Explorer) to directly view email. Adversaries may exploit privileged access with this premium feature to enumerate or exfiltrate sensitive data.
data_source:
- O365 Universal Audit Log
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=SecurityComplianceCenter Operation=AdminMailAccess | stats values(Workload) as category, values(MailboxId) as user, values(Operation) as signature, count, min(_time) as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime by InternetMessageId, UserId | rename InternetMessageId as signature_id, UserId as src_user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `o365_email_access_by_security_administrator_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events. Threat Explorer is a premium feature with o365, logging may not be available with proper license.
