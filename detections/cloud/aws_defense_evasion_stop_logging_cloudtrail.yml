description: This analytic identifies `StopLogging` events in CloudTrail logs. Adversaries often try to impair their target's defenses by stopping their macliious activity from being logged, so that they may operate with stealth and avoid detection. When the adversary has the right type of permissions in the compromised AWS environment, they may easily stop logging. 
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = StopLogging eventSource = cloudtrail.amazonaws.com userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com errorCode = success| stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.name) as stopped_cloudtrail_name by src region eventName userAgent user_arn aws_account_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_defense_evasion_stop_logging_cloudtrail_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable Cloudtrail logs in
  your AWS Environment.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has stopped cloudtrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
