description: The following analytic detects `StopLogging` events in AWS CloudTrail
  logs. It leverages CloudTrail event data to identify when logging is intentionally
  stopped, excluding console-based actions and focusing on successful attempts. This
  activity is significant because adversaries may stop logging to evade detection
  and operate stealthily within the compromised environment. If confirmed malicious,
  this action could allow attackers to perform further activities without being logged,
  hindering incident response and forensic investigations, and potentially leading
  to unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail StopLogging
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = StopLogging eventSource = cloudtrail.amazonaws.com
  userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com errorCode = success| stats count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.name) as stopped_cloudtrail_name

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable Cloudtrail logs in
  your AWS Environment.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has stopped cloudtrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
