description: This analytic identifies `StopLogging` events in CloudTrail logs. Adversaries
  often try to impair their target's defenses by stopping their macliious activity
  from being logged, so that they may operate with stealth and avoid detection. When
  the adversary has the right type of permissions in the compromised AWS environment,
  they may easily stop logging.

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable Cloudtrail logs in
  your AWS Environment.
