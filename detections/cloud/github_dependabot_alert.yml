description: "The following analytic identifies the creation of GitHub Dependabot
  alerts, which indicate potential vulnerabilities in the codebase. It detects this
  activity by searching for logs with the \"create\" action and analyzing fields such
  as affected package, severity, and fixed version. This detection is significant
  for a SOC because it helps identify and address security risks in the codebase proactively.
  If confirmed malicious, these vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers to
  gain unauthorized access or cause breaches, leading to potential data loss or system
  compromise."
data_source:
- GitHub
search: '`github` alert.id=* action=create | rename repository.full_name as repository,
  repository.html_url as repository_url sender.login as user | stats min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by action alert.affected_package_name alert.affected_range
  alert.created_at alert.external_identifier alert.external_reference alert.fixed_in
  alert.severity repository repository_url user | eval phase="code" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `github_dependabot_alert_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must index GitHub logs. You can follow the url in reference
  to onboard GitHub logs.
