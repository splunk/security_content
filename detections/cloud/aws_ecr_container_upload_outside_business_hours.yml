description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events from AWS Elastic Container
  Service (ECR). A upload of a new container is normally done during business hours.
  When done outside business hours, we want to take a look into it.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource=ecr.amazonaws.com eventName=PutImage date_hour>=20
  OR date_hour<8 NOT (date_wday=saturday OR date_wday=sunday) | rename requestParameters.*
  as * | rename repositoryName AS image | eval phase="release" | eval severity="medium"
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by awsRegion, eventName,
  eventSource, user, userName, src_ip, imageTag, registryId, image, phase, severity
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_ecr_container_upload_outside_business_hours_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: When your development is spreaded in different time zones,
  applying this rule can be difficult.
