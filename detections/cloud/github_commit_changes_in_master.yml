description: This search is to detect a pushed or commit to master or main branch.
  This is to avoid unwanted modification to master without a review to the changes.
  Ideally in terms of devsecops the changes made in a branch and do a PR for review.
  of course in some cases admin of the project may did a changes directly to master
  branch
search: '`github` branches{}.name = main OR branches{}.name = master | eval severity="low" | eval phase="code" |  stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  by commit.author.html_url commit.commit.author.email
  commit.author.login commit.commit.message repository.pushed_at commit.commit.committer.date, phase, severity
  | eval phase="code" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `github_commit_changes_in_master_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to github logs having the fork, commit, push metadata that can be use
  to monitor the changes in a github project.
known_false_positives: admin can do changes directly to master branch
