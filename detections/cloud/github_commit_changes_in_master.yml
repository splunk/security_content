description: The following analytic detects direct commits or pushes to the master
  or main branch in a GitHub repository. It leverages GitHub logs to identify events
  where changes are made directly to these critical branches. This activity is significant
  because direct modifications to the master or main branch bypass the standard review
  process, potentially introducing unreviewed and harmful changes. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized code execution, security vulnerabilities, or compromised
  project integrity.
data_source:
- GitHub
search: '`github` branches{}.name = main OR branches{}.name = master |  stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by commit.commit.author.email commit.author.login
  commit.commit.message repository.pushed_at commit.commit.committer.date repository.full_name
  | rename commit.author.login as user, repository.full_name as repository | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `github_commit_changes_in_master_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to github logs having the fork, commit, push metadata that can be use
  to monitor the changes in a github project.
known_false_positives: Admin can do changes directly to master branch
