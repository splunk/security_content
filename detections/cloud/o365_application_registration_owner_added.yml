data_source:
- O365 Add owner to application.
description: The following analytic identifies instances where a new owner is assigned
  to an application registration within an Azure AD and Office 365 tenant. It leverages
  O365 audit logs, specifically events related to changes in owner assignments within
  the AzureActiveDirectory workload. This activity is significant because assigning
  a new owner to an application registration can grant significant control over the
  application's configuration, permissions, and behavior. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could modify the application's settings, permissions, and behavior,
  leading to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, or the introduction of
  malicious behavior within the application's operations.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Application owners may be added for legitimate reasons, filter
  as needed.
