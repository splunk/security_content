description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a Service Principal
  in an Azure AD environment. An Azure Service Principal is an identity designed to
  be used with applications, services, and automated tools to access resources. It
  is similar to a service account within an Active Directory environment. Service
  Principal authentication does not support multi-factor authentication nor conditional
  access policies. Adversaries and red teams alike who have obtained administrative
  access may create a Service Principal to establish Persistence and obtain single-factor
  access to an Azure AD environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment thorough an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Administrator may legitimately create Service Principal. Filter
  as needed.
