description: The following analytic detects the creation of a Service Principal in
  an Azure AD environment. It leverages Azure Active Directory events ingested through
  EventHub, specifically monitoring the "Add service principal" operation. This activity
  is significant because Service Principals can be used by adversaries to establish
  persistence and bypass multi-factor authentication and conditional access policies.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain single-factor access
  to the Azure AD environment, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources
  and prolonged undetected activity.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Add service principal
search: '`azure_monitor_aad`  operationName="Add service principal" properties.initiatedBy.user.id=*
  | rename properties.* as * | rename targetResources{}.displayName as displayName
  | rename targetResources{}.type as type | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(displayName) as displayName by type, user, result, operationName
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `azure_ad_service_principal_created_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  thorough an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Administrator may legitimately create Service Principal. Filter
  as needed.
