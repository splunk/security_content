description: The following detection identifes when a policy is deleted on AWS. This
  does not identify whether successful or failed, but the error messages tell a story
  of suspicious attempts. There is a specific process to follow when deleting a policy.
  First, detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached
  to, using DetachUserPolicy , DetachGroupPolicy , or DetachRolePolicy.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=DeletePolicy (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com) | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.policyArn)
  as policyArn by src eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode errorMessage
  userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId userIdentity.arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_delete_policy_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS Cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete policies (least privilege). In addition, this may be saved seperately and
  tuned for failed or success attempts only.
