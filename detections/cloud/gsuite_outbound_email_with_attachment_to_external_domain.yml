description: This search is to detect a suspicious outbound e-mail from internal email
  to external email domain. This can be a good hunting query to monitor insider or
  outbound email traffic for not common domain e-mail. The idea is to parse the domain
  of destination email check if there is a minimum outbound traffic < 20 with attachment.
search: '`gsuite_gmail` num_message_attachments > 0 | rex field=source.from_header_address
  "[^@]+@(?<source_domain>[^@]+)" | rex field=destination{}.address "[^@]+@(?<dest_domain>[^@]+)"
  | where source_domain="internal_test_email.com" and not dest_domain="internal_test_email.com"
  | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="low" | stats values(subject) as subject, values(source.from_header_address)
  as src_domain_list, count as numEvents, dc(source.from_header_address) as numSrcAddresses,
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest_domain phase severity | where
  numSrcAddresses < 20 |sort - numSrcAddresses | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `gsuite_outbound_email_with_attachment_to_external_domain_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc.
known_false_positives: network admin and normal user may send this file attachment
  as part of their day to day work. having a good protocol in attaching this file
  type to an e-mail may reduce the risk of having a spear phishing attack.
