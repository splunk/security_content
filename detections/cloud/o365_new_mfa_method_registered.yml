description: The following analytic detects the registration of a new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method for a user account within Office 365. It leverages O365 audit logs to identify changes in MFA configurations. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attacker's attempt to maintain persistence on a compromised account. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could bypass existing security measures, solidify their access, and potentially escalate privileges or access sensitive data. Immediate verification and remediation are required to secure the affected account.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Users may register MFA methods legitimally, investigate and filter as needed.
