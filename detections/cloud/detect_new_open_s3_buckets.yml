description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user has created
  an open/public S3 bucket.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose.
  That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to the "All Users"
  group.
