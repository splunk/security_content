  S3 bucket.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk.
id: 2a9b80d3-6340-4345-b5ad-290bf3d0dac4
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose.
  That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to the "All Users"
  group.
