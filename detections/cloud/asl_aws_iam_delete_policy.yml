description: The following analytic detects the deletion of an AWS policy, a critical action that could indicate an attempt to alter permissions 
  or reduce security controls. By monitoring AWS logs for `DeletePolicy` events, this analytic identifies both successful and attempted deletions, 
  providing insights into potentially malicious activities. Identifying such behavior is crucial for a Security Operations Center (SOC) as it may 
  signal an adversary's effort to escalate privileges or evade detection. The impact of unauthorized policy deletion is significant, 
  potentially leading to compromised accounts or data exposure.

  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by api.operation actor.user.account_uid actor.user.name actor.user.uid http_request.user_agent src_endpoint.ip cloud.region

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete policies (least privilege). In addition, this may be saved seperately and
  tuned for failed or success attempts only.
