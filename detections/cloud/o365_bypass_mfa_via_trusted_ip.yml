description: This search detects newly added IP addresses/CIDR blocks to the list
  of MFA Trusted IPs to bypass multi factor authentication. Attackers are often known
  to use this technique so that they can bypass the MFA system.

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: Unless it is a special case, it is uncommon to continually
  update Trusted IPs to MFA configuration.
