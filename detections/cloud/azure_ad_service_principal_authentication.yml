data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Sign-in activity
type: TTP
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies authentication events of service principals
  in Azure Active Directory. It leverages the `azure_monitor_aad` data source, specifically
  targeting "Sign-in activity" within ServicePrincipalSignInLogs. This detection gathers
  details such as sign-in frequency, timing, source IPs, and accessed resources. Monitoring
  these events is significant for SOC teams to distinguish between normal application
  authentication and potential anomalies, which could indicate compromised credentials
  or malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized
  access to resources, leading to data breaches or further exploitation within the
  environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Service Principals will legitimally authenticate remotely to
  your tenant. Implementing this detection after establishing a baseline enables a
  more accurate identification of security threats, ensuring proactive and informed
  responses to safeguard the Azure AD environment. source ips.
