description: Monitoring service principal authentication events in Azure Active Directory is crucial, but to effectively leverage this detection, teams should first conduct a thorough inventory of all service principals and their source IPs to establish a baseline of normal behavior. The detection, using azure_monitor_aad, specifically targets "Sign-in activity" within ServicePrincipalSignInLogs, gathering key details like sign-in frequency, timing, source IPs, and accessed resources. This baseline is essential for SOC teams to distinguish between regular application authentication and anomalous patterns that might suggest compromised credentials or malicious activities.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Service Principals will legitimally authenticate remotely to your tenant. Implementing this detection after establishing a baseline enables a more accurate identification of security threats, ensuring proactive and informed responses to safeguard the Azure AD environment.
