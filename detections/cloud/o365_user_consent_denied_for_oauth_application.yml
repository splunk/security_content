description: The following analytic identifies instances where a user has denied consent
  to an OAuth application seeking permissions within the Office 365 environment. This
  detection leverages O365 audit logs, focusing on events related to user consent
  actions. By filtering for denied consent actions associated with OAuth applications,
  it captures instances where users have actively rejected permission requests. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate users spotting potentially suspicious
  or unfamiliar applications. If confirmed malicious, it suggests an attempt by a
  potentially harmful application to gain unauthorized access, which was proactively
  blocked by the user.
search: ' `o365_graph` status.errorCode=65004 | rename userPrincipalName as user |
  rename ipAddress as src_ip | stats max(_time) as lastTime by user src_ip appDisplayName
  status.failureReason | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `o365_user_consent_denied_for_oauth_application_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 events.
known_false_positives: OAuth applications that require mail permissions may be legitimate,
  investigate and filter as needed.
