description: The following analytic detects API calls to enable S3 bucket replication
  services. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify `PutBucketReplication` events,
  focusing on fields like `bucketName`, `ReplicationConfiguration.Rule.Destination.Bucket`,
  and user details. This activity is significant as it can indicate unauthorized data
  replication, potentially leading to data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, attackers
  could replicate sensitive data to external accounts, leading to data breaches and
  compliance violations.
search: '`cloudtrail`  eventName = PutBucketReplication eventSource = s3.amazonaws.com
  | rename requestParameters.* as * 
  | stats count values(bucketName) as source_bucket values(ReplicationConfiguration.Rule.ID) as rule_id values(ReplicationConfiguration.Rule.Destination.Bucket) as destination_bucket by _time user_arn userName user_type src_ip aws_account_id userIdentity.principalId user_agent | `aws_exfiltration_via_bucket_replication_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately implemented
  data replication to ensure data availability and improve data protection/backup
  strategies.
