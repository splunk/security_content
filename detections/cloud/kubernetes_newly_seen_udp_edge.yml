type: Anomaly
description: 'The following analytic detects UDP communication between a newly seen
  source and destination workload pair within a Kubernetes cluster. It leverages Network
  Performance Monitoring metrics collected via an OTEL collector and pulled from Splunk
  Observability Cloud. This detection compares network activity over the last hour
  with the past 30 days to identify new inter-workload communication. Such changes
  in network behavior can indicate potential security threats or anomalies. If confirmed
  malicious, unauthorized connections may enable attackers to infiltrate the application
  ecosystem, leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, lateral movement, or
  disruption of critical services.'

how_to_implement: 'To gather NPM metrics the Open Telemetry to the Kubernetes Cluster and 
  enable Network Performance Monitoring according to instructions found in Splunk Docs 
  https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/infrastructure/network-explorer/network-explorer-setup.html#network-explorer-setup 
  In order to access those metrics from within Splunk Enterprise and ES, the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring add-on must be installed and 
  configured on a Splunk Search Head.  Once installed, first configure the add-on with your O11y Cloud Org ID and Access Token. 
  Lastly set up the add-on to ingest metrics from O11y cloud using the following settings, and any other settings left at default:
  
  * Name sim_npm_metrics_to_metrics_index 

  * Metric Resolution 10000'
