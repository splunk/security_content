description: 'The following analytic detects failed authentication attempts during
  the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) challenge on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  tenant. It uses Google Workspace login failure events to identify instances where
  MFA methods were challenged but not successfully completed. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate an adversary attempting to access an account with compromised
  credentials despite MFA protection. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  access attempts, potentially compromising sensitive data and resources within the
  GCP environment.'
data_source:
- Google Workspace login_failure
search: ' `gws_reports_login` event.name=login_failure `gws_login_mfa_methods` | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by user, src_ip, login_challenge_method
  | `gcp_authentication_failed_during_mfa_challenge_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google
  Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows
  Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google
  Workspace APIs. Specifically, this analytic leverages the User log events.
known_false_positives: Legitimate users may miss to reply the MFA challenge within
  the time window or deny it by mistake.
