description: The following analytic detects the creation of permanent access keys
  in AWS accounts. It leverages CloudWatch logs to identify events where the `CreateAccessKey`
  action is performed by IAM users. Monitoring the creation of permanent keys is crucial
  as they are not created by default and are typically used for programmatic access.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to gain persistent access
  to AWS resources, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and data exfiltration.
data_source: []
search: '`aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` CreateAccessKey | spath eventName | search eventName=CreateAccessKey
  "userIdentity.type"=IAMUser | table sourceIPAddress userName userIdentity.type userAgent
  action status responseElements.accessKey.createDate responseElements.accessKey.status
  responseElements.accessKey.accessKeyId |`aws_detect_permanent_key_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudwatch logs
known_false_positives: Not all permanent key creations are malicious. If there is
  a policy of rotating keys this search can be adjusted to provide better context.
