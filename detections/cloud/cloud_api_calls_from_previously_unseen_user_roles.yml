how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider.  You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud API Calls Per
  User Role - Initial` to build the initial table of user roles, commands, and times.
  You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud API Calls
  Per User Role - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You
  can adjust the time window for this search by updating the `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_activity_window`
  macro. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing
  the `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_filter`
