description: |-
  The following analytic detects cloud API calls executed by user roles that have not previously run these commands. It leverages the Change data model in Splunk to identify commands executed by users with the user_type of AssumedRole and a status of success. This activity is significant because new commands from different user roles can indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other damaging outcomes by exploiting new or unmonitored commands within the cloud environment.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider.  You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud API Calls Per
  User Role - Initial` to build the initial table of user roles, commands, and times.
  You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud API Calls
  Per User Role - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You
  can adjust the time window for this search by updating the `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_activity_window`
  macro. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing
  the `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_filter`
known_false_positives: None.
