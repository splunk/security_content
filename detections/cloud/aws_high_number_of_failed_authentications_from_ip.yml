name: AWS High Number Of Failed Authentications From Ip

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies an IP address failing to authenticate
  20 or more times to the AWS Web Console in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior
  could represent a brute force attack against an AWS tenant to obtain initial access
  or elevate privileges. As environments differ across organizations, security teams
  should customize the threshold of this detection.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure | bucket span=5m _time
  | stats dc(_raw) AS failed_attempts values(user_name) as tried_accounts values(user_agent)
  by _time, src_ip, eventName, eventSource aws_account_id | where failed_attempts
  > 20 |  `aws_high_number_of_failed_authentications_from_ip_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-on for AWS in order to ingest Cloudtrail.
  We recommend the users to try different combinations of the bucket span time and
  the tried account threshold to tune this search according to their environment.
known_false_positives: An Ip address with more than 20 failed authentication attempts
  in the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
