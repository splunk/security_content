description: The following analytic detects an Azure AD account with concurrent sessions originating from multiple unique IP addresses within a 5-minute window. It leverages Azure Active Directory NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs to identify this behavior by analyzing successful authentication events and counting distinct source IPs. This activity is significant as it may indicate session hijacking, where an attacker uses stolen session cookies to access corporate resources from a different location. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential data breaches.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment. Also consider the geographic location of the IP addresses and filter out IP space that belong to your organization.
