description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account with concurrent
  sessions coming from more than one unique Ip address within the span of 5 minutes.
  This behavior could represent a session hijacking attack whereby an adversary has
  extracted cookies from a victims browser and is using them from a different location
  to access corporate online resources. As users may behave differently across organizations,
  security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also
  represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize
  the threshold to fit your environment.
