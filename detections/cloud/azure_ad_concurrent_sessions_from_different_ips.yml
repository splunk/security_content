description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account with concurrent sessions coming from more than one unique Ip address within the span of 5 minutes. 
  This behavior could represent a session hijacking attack whereby an adversary has extracted cookies from a victims browser and is using them from a different location to 
  access corporate online resources. As users may behave differently across organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). 
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs
  log category.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
