description: The following analytic detects AWS `DeleteTrail` events within CloudTrail
  logs. It leverages Amazon Security Lake logs parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema
  Framework (OCSF) format to identify when a CloudTrail is deleted. This activity
  is significant because adversaries may delete CloudTrail logs to evade detection
  and operate with stealth. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers
  to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace their activities and investigate
  other potential compromises within the AWS environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon
  Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related
  data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from
  Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events
  using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876)
  or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has stopped cloudTrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
