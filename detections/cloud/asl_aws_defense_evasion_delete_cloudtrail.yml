description: The following analytic detects the deletion of AWS CloudTrail logs, a critical event that could indicate 
  an adversary's attempt to evade detection. By identifying `DeleteTrail` events within CloudTrail logs, this analytic helps
  in uncovering efforts to impair defense mechanisms by preventing the logging of malicious activities. Such actions allow adversaries 
  to operate undetected within a compromised AWS environment. Recognizing these deletion events is crucial for a 
  Security Operations Center (SOC) as it signals a potential compromise and the attacker's intent to hide their tracks, 
  making it a significant threat to the integrity and security of cloud environments. The impact of this attack is substantial, 
  as it can lead to a complete loss of visibility into the activities within the environment, hindering incident response and forensics efforts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has stopped cloudTrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
