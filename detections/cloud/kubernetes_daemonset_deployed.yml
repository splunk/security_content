description: The following analytic detects the creation of a DaemonSet in a Kubernetes cluster. 
  A DaemonSet ensures the presence of a specific pod on every node in the cluster, making it an ideal avenue for persistent access. 
  This behavior is identified by monitoring Kubernetes Audit logs for the creation of a DaemonSet. 
  The identified behavior is worth noting for a SOC as it could potentially allow an attacker to maintain persistent access to the Kubernetes infrastructure. 
  The impact of such an attack could be severe, leading to persistent attacks, service disruptions, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.
  Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
  Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server.
  Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
