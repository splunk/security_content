description: The following analytic detects the creation of a DaemonSet in a Kubernetes
  cluster. This behavior is identified by monitoring Kubernetes Audit logs for the
  creation event of a DaemonSet. DaemonSets ensure a specific pod runs on every node,
  making them a potential vector for persistent access. This activity is significant
  for a SOC as it could indicate an attempt to maintain persistent access to the Kubernetes
  infrastructure. If confirmed malicious, it could lead to persistent attacks, service
  disruptions, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.
  Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
  Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server.
  Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
