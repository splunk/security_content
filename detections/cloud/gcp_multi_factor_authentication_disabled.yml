description: The following analytic identifies an attempt to disable multi-factor authentication for a GCP user. An adversary who has obtained access to an GCP tenant 
  may disable multi-factor authentication as a way to plant a backdoor and maintain persistence using a valid account.
  This way the attackers can keep persistance in the environment without adding new users.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google Workspace APIs. 
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the Admin log events.
known_false_positives: Legitimate use case may require for users to disable MFA. Filter as needed.
