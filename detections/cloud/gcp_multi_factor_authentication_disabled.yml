description: The following analytic detects an attempt to disable multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) for a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) user. It leverages Google Workspace Admin
  log events, specifically the `UNENROLL_USER_FROM_STRONG_AUTH` command. This activity
  is significant because disabling MFA can allow an adversary to maintain persistence
  within the environment using a compromised account without raising suspicion. If
  confirmed malicious, this action could enable attackers to bypass additional security
  layers, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further
  exploitation of the compromised account.
data_source:
- Google Workspace
search: '`gws_reports_admin` command=UNENROLL_USER_FROM_STRONG_AUTH | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by user, command, actor.email, status,
  id.applicationName, event.name, vendor_account, action | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `gcp_multi_factor_authentication_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google
  Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows
  Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google
  Workspace APIs. Specifically, this analytic leverages the Admin log events.
known_false_positives: Legitimate use case may require for users to disable MFA. Filter
  as needed.
