- O365 UserLoginFailed
description: The following analytic identifies an O365 account experiencing more than
  20 failed authentication attempts within 5 minutes. It uses O365 Unified Audit Logs,
  specifically "UserLoginFailed" events, to monitor and flag accounts exceeding this
  threshold. This activity is significant as it may indicate a brute force attack
  or password guessing attempt. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized
  access to the O365 environment, potentially compromising sensitive emails, documents,
  and other data. Prompt investigation and action are crucial to prevent unauthorized
  access and data breaches.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Although unusual, users who have lost their passwords may trigger
  this detection. Filter as needed.
