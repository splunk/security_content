  authentication method for an Azure AD account. Adversaries who have obtained unauthorized
  access to an Azure AD account may register a new MFA method to maintain persistence.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Newly onboarded users who are registering an MFA method for
  the first time will also trigger this detection.
