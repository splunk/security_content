description: The following analytic identifies a user attaching a policy to a different
  role's trust policy in AWS. It leverages CloudWatch logs to detect the `attach policy`
  event, extracting relevant fields such as `policyArn`, `sourceIPAddress`, and `userIdentity`.
  This activity is significant as it can indicate attempts at lateral movement or
  privilege escalation within the AWS environment. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could gain elevated permissions, potentially compromising sensitive resources and
  data within the AWS infrastructure.

search: '`aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` attach policy| spath requestParameters.policyArn
  | table sourceIPAddress user_access_key userIdentity.arn userIdentity.sessionContext.sessionIssuer.arn
  eventName errorCode errorMessage status action requestParameters.policyArn userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated
  userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.creationDate  | `aws_detect_attach_to_role_policy_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add-on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudwatch logs
known_false_positives: Attach to policy can create a lot of noise. This search can
  be adjusted to provide specific values to identify cases of abuse (i.e status=failure).
  The search can provide context for common users attaching themselves to higher privilege
  policies or even newly created policies.
