- Authentication
description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events wherein a console login event
  by a user was recorded within the last hour, then compares the event to a lookup
  file of previously seen users (by ARN values) who have logged into the console.
  The alert is fired if the user has logged into the console for the first time within
  the last hour

how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version
  5.1.0 or later) and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates
  to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Run the `Previously Seen Users
  in AWS CloudTrail - Initial` support search only once to create a baseline of previously
  seen IAM users within the last 30 days. Run `Previously Seen Users in AWS CloudTrail
  - Update` hourly (or more frequently depending on how often you run the detection
  searches) to refresh the baselines. You can also provide additional filtering for
  this search by customizing the `detect_aws_console_login_by_user_from_new_city_filter`
  macro.
known_false_positives: When a legitimate new user logins for the first time, this
  activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the user
  activity is legitimate.
