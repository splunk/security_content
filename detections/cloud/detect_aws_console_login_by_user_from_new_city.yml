name: Detect AWS Console Login by User from New City
id: 121b0b11-f8ac-4ed6-a132-3800ca4fc07a

description: This search looks for CloudTrail events wherein a console login event
  by a user was recorded within the last hour, then compares the event to a lookup
  file of previously seen users (by ARN values) who have logged into the console.
  The alert is fired if the user has logged into the console for the first time within
  the last hour
how_to_implement: "You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your
  cloud provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously seen users in CloudTrail - Initial`
  to build the initial table of source IP address, geographic locations, and times. You must also enable the second
  baseline search `Previously Seen users in Cloudtrail - Update` to keep this table up to date and
  to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by
  customizing the `detect_aws_console_login_by_user_from_new_city_filter` macro."

known_false_positives: When a legitimate new user logins for the first time, this
  activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the user
  activity is legitimate.
