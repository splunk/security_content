type: Anomaly
description: This search provides specific SAML access from specific Service Provider,
  user and targeted principal at AWS. This search provides specific information to
  detect abnormal access or potential credential hijack or forgery, specially in federated
  environments using SAML protocol inside the perimeter or cloud provider.
data_source: []
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=Assumerolewithsaml | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by requestParameters.principalArn requestParameters.roleArn
  requestParameters.roleSessionName recipientAccountId responseElements.issuer sourceIPAddress
  userAgent | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |`aws_saml_access_by_provider_user_and_principal_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs
known_false_positives: Attacks using a Golden SAML or SAML assertion hijacks or forgeries
  are very difficult to detect as accessing cloud providers with these assertions
  looks exactly like normal access, however things such as source IP sourceIPAddress
  user, and principal targeted at receiving cloud provider along with endpoint credential
  access and abuse detection searches can provide the necessary context to detect
  these attacks.
