name: AWS SAML Access by Provider User and Principal

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies specific SAML access events by a service
  provider, user, and targeted principal within AWS. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs
  to detect the `AssumeRoleWithSAML` event, analyzing fields such as `principalArn`,
  `roleArn`, and `roleSessionName`. This activity is significant as it can indicate
  abnormal access patterns or potential credential hijacking, especially in federated
  environments using the SAML protocol. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to assume roles and gain unauthorized access to sensitive AWS resources, leading
  to data breaches or further exploitation.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail AssumeRoleWithSAML
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=Assumerolewithsaml | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by eventName requestParameters.principalArn requestParameters.roleArn
  requestParameters.roleSessionName recipientAccountId responseElements.issuer sourceIPAddress
  userAgent | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |`aws_saml_access_by_provider_user_and_principal_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs
known_false_positives: Attacks using a Golden SAML or SAML assertion hijacks or forgeries
  are very difficult to detect as accessing cloud providers with these assertions
  looks exactly like normal access, however things such as source IP sourceIPAddress
  user, and principal targeted at receiving cloud provider along with endpoint credential
  access and abuse detection searches can provide the necessary context to detect
  these attacks.
