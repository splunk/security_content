description: This search looks for a spike in number of of AWS security Hub alerts for an EC2 instance in 4 hours intervals
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your Security Hub
  inputs. The threshold_value should be tuned to your environment and schedule these searches according to the bucket span interval.
