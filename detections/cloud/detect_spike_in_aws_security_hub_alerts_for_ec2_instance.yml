description: This search looks for a spike in number of of AWS security Hub alerts
  for an EC2 instance in 4 hours intervals
search: '`aws_securityhub_finding` "Resources{}.Type"=AWSEC2Instance | bucket span=4h
  _time | stats count AS alerts values(Title) as Title values(Types{}) as Types values(vendor_account)
  as vendor_account values(vendor_region) as vendor_region values(severity) as severity
  by _time dest | eventstats avg(alerts) as total_alerts_avg, stdev(alerts) as total_alerts_stdev

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your Security
  Hub inputs. The threshold_value should be tuned to your environment and schedule
  these searches according to the bucket span interval.
