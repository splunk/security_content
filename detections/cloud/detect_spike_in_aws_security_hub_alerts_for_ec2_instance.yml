name: Detect Spike in AWS Security Hub Alerts for EC2 Instance

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a spike in the number of AWS Security
  Hub alerts for an EC2 instance within a 4-hour interval. It leverages AWS Security
  Hub findings data, calculating the average and standard deviation of alerts to detect
  anomalies. This activity is significant for a SOC as a sudden increase in alerts
  may indicate potential security incidents or misconfigurations requiring immediate
  attention. If confirmed malicious, this could signify an ongoing attack, leading
  to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or disruption of services on the affected
  EC2 instance.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your Security
  Hub inputs. The threshold_value should be tuned to your environment and schedule
  these searches according to the bucket span interval.
