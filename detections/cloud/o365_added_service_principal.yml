description: This search detects the creation of a new Federation setting by alerting
  about an specific event related to its creation.
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory signature="Add service
  principal credentials." | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(Actor{}.ID)
  as Actor.ID values(ModifiedProperties{}.Name) as ModifiedProperties.Name values(ModifiedProperties{}.NewValue)
  as ModifiedProperties.NewValue values(Target{}.ID) as Target.ID by ActorIpAddress
  signature | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_added_service_principal_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: The creation of a new Federation is not necessarily malicious,
  however these events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential
  abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a different cloud provider.
