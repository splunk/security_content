description: The following analytic detects addition of new service principal accounts added to O365 tenants. Attackers can abuse service principals in Office 365 (now known as Microsoft 365) to gain unauthorized access and perform malicious actions within an organization's environment. Service principals are essentially non-human accounts used by applications, services, or scripts to access resources and interact with APIs on behalf of the organization. 
data_source: []
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory Operation="*Add service principal*" OR (Operation = "*principal*" AND action = "created") 
  | stats count values(ModifiedProperties{}.NewValue) as new_value by src_user src_user_type action Operation authentication_service Workload 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `o365_added_service_principal_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: The creation of a new Federation is not necessarily malicious,
  however these events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential
  abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a different cloud provider.
