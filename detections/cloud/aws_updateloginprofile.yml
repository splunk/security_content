datamodel: []
description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user A who has already
  permission to update login profile, makes an API call to update login profile for
  another user B . Attackers have been know to use this technique for Privilege Escalation
  in case new victim(user B) has more permissions than old victim(user B)
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = UpdateLoginProfile userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com
  errorCode = success| search userName!=requestParameters.userName  |  stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  by requestParameters.userName src
  eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode userAgent eventID awsRegion userName
  user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|`aws_updateloginprofile_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created keys for another user.
