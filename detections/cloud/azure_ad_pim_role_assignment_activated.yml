description: The following analytic detects the activation of an Azure AD Privileged
  Identity Management (PIM) role. It leverages Azure Active Directory events to identify
  when a user activates a PIM role assignment, indicated by the "Add member to role
  completed (PIM activation)" operation. Monitoring this activity is crucial as PIM
  roles grant elevated privileges, and unauthorized activation could indicate an adversary
  attempting to gain privileged access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  unauthorized administrative actions, data breaches, or further compromise of the
  Azure environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: As part of legitimate administrative behavior, users may activate
  PIM roles. Filter as needed
