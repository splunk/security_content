description: This search looks for EC2 instances being created by users who have not
  created them before.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen EC2 Launches By
  User" support search once to create a history of previously seen ARNs.

known_false_positives: It's possible that a user will start to create EC2 instances
  when they haven't before for any number of reasons. Verify with the user that is
  launching instances that this is the intended behavior.
