description: 'The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication requests for a single user within an Azure AD tenant. Error Code 500121 represents a failed attempt to authenticate using a second factor.
  Specifically, the analytic triggers when more than 10 MFA user prompts fail within 10 minutes. Azure AD tenants can be very different depending on the organization, Security teams should test this detection and customize these arbitrary thresholds.
  The detected behavior may represent an adversary who has obtained legitimate credentials for a user and continuously repeats login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls
  potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request.
  Threat actors like the Lapsus team and APT29 have leveraged this technique to bypass multi-factor authentication controls as reported by Mandiant and others.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). 
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs
  log category.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication or application issues. Filter as needed.
