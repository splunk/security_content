description: The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication
  requests for a single user within an Azure AD tenant. Error Code 500121 represents
  a failed attempt to authenticate using a second factor. Specifically, the analytic
  triggers when more than 10 MFA user prompts fail within 10 minutes. The reasons for these failure could be several, 
  like the user not responding in time or receiving multiple duplicate MFA requests.
  Azure AD tenants can be very different depending on the organization, Security teams should test
  this detection and customize these arbitrary thresholds. The detected behavior may
  represent an adversary who has obtained legitimate credentials for a user and continuously
  repeats login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS
  messages, and phone calls potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the
  authentication request. Threat actors like the Lapsus team and APT29 have leveraged
  this technique to bypass multi-factor authentication controls as reported by Mandiant
  and others.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication
  or application issues. Filter as needed.
