description: This search establishes, on a per-hour basis, the average and standard
  deviation for the number of API calls related to deleting an S3 bucket by each user.
  Also recorded is the number of data points for each user. This table is then outputted
  to a lookup file to allow the detection search to operate quickly.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=DeleteBucket | spath output=arn path=userIdentity.arn
  | bucket _time span=1h | stats count as apiCalls by _time, arn | stats count(apiCalls)
  as numDataPoints, latest(apiCalls) as latestCount, avg(apiCalls) as avgApiCalls,
  stdev(apiCalls) as stdevApiCalls by arn | table arn, latestCount, numDataPoints,
  avgApiCalls, stdevApiCalls | outputlookup s3_deletion_baseline | stats count'
