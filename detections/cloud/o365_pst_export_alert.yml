  exported a PST file from the search. This PST file usually has sensitive information
  including email body content
search: '`o365_management_activity` Category=ThreatManagement Name="eDiscovery search
  started or exported" | stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as
  lastTime by Source Severity AlertEntityId Operation Name |`security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
