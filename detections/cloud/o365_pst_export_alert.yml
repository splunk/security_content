description: The following analytic detects instances where a user has initiated an
  eDiscovery search or exported a PST file in an Office 365 environment. It leverages
  Office 365 management activity logs, specifically filtering for events under ThreatManagement
  with the name "eDiscovery search started or exported." This activity is significant
  as it may indicate data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized access to sensitive
  information. If confirmed malicious, it suggests an attacker or insider threat is
  attempting to gather or exfiltrate data, potentially leading to data breaches, loss
  of intellectual property, or unauthorized access to confidential communications.
  Immediate investigation is required.
