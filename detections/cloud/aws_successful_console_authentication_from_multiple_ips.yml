description: The following analytic identifies an AWS account successfully authenticating
  from more than one unique Ip address in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior could
  represent an adversary who has stolen credentials via a phishing attack or some
  other method and using them to access corporate online resources around the same
  time as a legitimate user. As users may behave differently across organizations,
  security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: ' `cloudtrail` eventName = ConsoleLogin | bin span=5m _time | stats values(userAgent) as userAgent
  values(eventName) as eventName values(src_ip) as src_ip dc(src_ip) as distinct_ip_count by _time user_arn
  | where distinct_ip_count>1 | `aws_successful_console_authentication_from_multiple_ips_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works when AWS CloudTrail events are normalized use the Authentication datamodel.
known_false_positives: A user with successful authentication events from different
  Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed
  and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
