type: Anomaly
datamodel: []
description: The following analytic identifies an AWS account successfully authenticating from more than one unique Ip address in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior could represent
  an adversary who has stolen credentials via a phishing attack or some other method and using them to access corporate online resources around the same time as a legitimate user.
  As users may behave differently across organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments.
search: ' `cloudtrail` eventName = ConsoleLogin 
  | bin span=5m _time 
  | stats values(userAgent) values(eventName) values(src_ip) dc(src_ip) as distinct_ip_count by _time user_arn 
  | where distinct_ip_count>1 
  | `aws_successful_console_authentication_from_multiple_ips_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works when AWS CloudTrail events are normalized use the Authentication datamodel.
known_false_positives: A user with successful authentication events from different Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
