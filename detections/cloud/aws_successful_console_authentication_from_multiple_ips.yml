description: The following analytic detects an AWS account successfully authenticating
  from multiple unique IP addresses within a 5-minute window. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  logs, specifically monitoring `ConsoleLogin` events and counting distinct source
  IPs. This behavior is significant as it may indicate compromised credentials, potentially
  from a phishing attack, being used concurrently by an adversary and a legitimate
  user. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow unauthorized access to corporate
  resources, leading to data breaches or further exploitation within the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: ' `cloudtrail` eventName = ConsoleLogin | bin span=5m _time | stats values(userAgent)
  as userAgent values(eventName) as eventName values(src_ip) as src_ip dc(src_ip)
  as distinct_ip_count by _time user_arn | where distinct_ip_count>1 | `aws_successful_console_authentication_from_multiple_ips_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works when AWS CloudTrail events are normalized use the Authentication datamodel.
known_false_positives: A user with successful authentication events from different
  Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed
  and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
