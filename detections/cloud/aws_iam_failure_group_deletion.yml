description: The following analytic identifies failed attempts to delete AWS IAM groups.
  It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to detect events where the DeleteGroup action fails
  due to errors like NoSuchEntityException, DeleteConflictException, or AccessDenied.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate unauthorized attempts to modify
  IAM group configurations, which could be a precursor to privilege escalation or
  other malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to
  disrupt IAM policies, potentially leading to unauthorized access or denial of service
  within the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteGroup
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource=iam.amazonaws.com eventName=DeleteGroup errorCode
  IN (NoSuchEntityException,DeleteConflictException, AccessDenied) (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.groupName)
  as group_name by src eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode errorMessage
  userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_failure_group_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete groups (least privilege).
