description: This detection identifies failure attempts to delete groups. We want
  to identify when a group is attempting to be deleted, but either access is denied,
  there is a conflict or there is no group. This is indicative of administrators performing
  an action, but also could be suspicious behavior occurring. Review parallel IAM
  events - recently added users, new groups and so forth.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteGroup
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource=iam.amazonaws.com eventName=DeleteGroup errorCode
  IN (NoSuchEntityException,DeleteConflictException, AccessDenied) (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.groupName)
  as group_name by src eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode errorMessage
  userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_failure_group_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete groups (least privilege).
