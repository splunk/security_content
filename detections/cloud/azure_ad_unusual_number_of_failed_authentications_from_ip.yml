datamodel: []
description: 'The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple valid users. This behavior could 
  represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Azure Active Directory tenant to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Error Code
  50126 represents an invalid password.\

  The detection calculates the standard deviation for source Ip and leverages the
  3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number of failed authentication attempts. To customize this
  analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket` span time and the
  calculation of the `upperBound` field. This logic can be used for real time security
  monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.\

  While looking for anomalies using statistical methods like the standard deviation can have benefits, we also recommend using threshold-based detections to complement coverage.
  A similar analytic following the threshold model is `Azure AD Multiple Users Failing To Authenticate From Ip`.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of  Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from  Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events in your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs
  log category.
known_false_positives: A source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple users is not a common for legitimate behavior.
