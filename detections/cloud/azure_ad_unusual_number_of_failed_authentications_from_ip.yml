description: 'The following analytic identifies a single source IP failing to authenticate
  with multiple valid users, potentially indicating a Password Spraying attack against
  an Azure Active Directory tenant. It uses Azure SignInLogs data and calculates the
  standard deviation for source IPs, applying the 3-sigma rule to detect unusual numbers
  of failed authentication attempts. This activity is significant as it may signal
  an adversary attempting to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential
  compromise of sensitive information.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: A source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple users is
  not a common for legitimate behavior.
