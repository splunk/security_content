type: Anomaly
description: 'The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate
  with multiple valid users. This behavior could represent an adversary performing
  a Password Spraying attack against an Azure Active Directory tenant to obtain initial
  access or elevate privileges. Error Code 50126 represents an invalid password.

  The detection calculates the standard deviation for source Ip and leverages the
  3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number of failed authentication
  attempts. To customize this analytic, users can try different combinations of the
  `bucket` span time and the calculation of the `upperBound` field. This logic can
  be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.

  While looking for anomalies using statistical methods like the standard deviation
  can have benefits, we also recommend using threshold-based detections to complement
  coverage. A similar analytic following the threshold model is `Azure AD Multiple
  Users Failing To Authenticate From Ip`.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: A source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple users is
  not a common for legitimate behavior.
