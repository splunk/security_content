name: Detect AWS Console Login by User from New Region
id: 9f31aa8e-e37c-46bc-bce1-8b3be646d026
version: 1

description: This search looks for CloudTrail events wherein a console login event
  by a user was recorded within the last hour, then compares the event to a lookup
  file of previously seen users (by ARN values) who have logged into the console.
  The alert is fired if the user has logged into the console for the first time within
  the last hour
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously seen users in CloudTrail
  - Initial` to build the initial table of source IP address, geographic locations,
  and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen users
  in Cloudtrail - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You
  can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `detect_aws_console_login_by_user_from_new_region_filter`
  macro.

known_false_positives: When a legitimate new user logins for the first time, this
  activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the user
  activity is legitimate.
