name: Detect AWS Console Login by User from New Region
id: 9f31aa8e-e37c-46bc-bce1-8b3be646d026
version: 1
date: '2018-04-30'
description: This search looks for CloudTrail events wherein a console login event
  by a user was recorded within the last hour, then compares the event to a lookup
  file of previously seen users (by ARN values) who have logged into the console.
  The alert is fired if the user has logged into the console for the first time within
  the last hour
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Run the "Previously seen users in CloudTrail" support search only once to
  create a baseline of previously seen IAM users within the last 30 days. Run "Update
  previously seen users in CloudTrail" hourly (or more frequently depending on how
  often you run the detection searches) to refresh the baselines.

known_false_positives: When a legitimate new user logins for the first time, this
  activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the user
  activity is legitimate.
