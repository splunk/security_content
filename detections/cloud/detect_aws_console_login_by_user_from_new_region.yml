description: The following analytic identifies AWS console login attempts by users
  from a new region. It leverages AWS CloudTrail events and compares current login
  regions against a baseline of previously seen regions for each user. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate unauthorized access attempts or compromised credentials.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to AWS resources,
  potentially leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, or further lateral
  movement within the cloud environment.

how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version
  5.1.0 or later) and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates
  to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Run the `Previously Seen Users
  in AWS CloudTrail - Initial` support search only once to create a baseline of previously
  seen IAM users within the last 30 days. Run `Previously Seen Users in AWS CloudTrail
  - Update` hourly (or more frequently depending on how often you run the detection
  searches) to refresh the baselines. You can also provide additional filtering for
  this search by customizing the `detect_aws_console_login_by_user_from_new_region_filter`
  macro.
known_false_positives: When a legitimate new user logins for the first time, this
  activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the user
  activity is legitimate.

  manual_test: This search needs the baseline to be run first to create a lookup.
    It also requires that the timestamps in the dataset be updated.
