description: The following analytic detects the invitation of an external guest user
  within Azure AD. It leverages Azure AD AuditLogs to identify events where an external
  user is invited, using fields such as operationName and initiatedBy. Monitoring
  these invitations is crucial as they can lead to unauthorized access if abused.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to gain access to internal
  resources, potentially leading to data breaches or further exploitation of the environment.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Invite external user
search: '`azure_monitor_aad` operationName="Invite external user" | rename properties.*  as
  * | rename initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName as initiatedBy | rename targetResources{}.type
  as type | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user)
  as user by type, initiatedBy, result, operationName | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `azure_ad_external_guest_user_invited_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Administrator may legitimately invite external guest users.
  Filter as needed.
