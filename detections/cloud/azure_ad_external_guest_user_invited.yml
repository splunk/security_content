description: The following analytic identifies the invitation of an external guest
  user within Azure AD. With Azure AD B2B collaboration, users and administrators
  can invite external users to collaborate with internal users. External guest account
  invitations should be monitored by security teams as they could potentially lead
  to unauthorized access. An example of this attack vector was described at BlackHat
  2022 by security researcher Dirk-Jan during his tall `Backdooring and Hijacking
  Azure AD Accounts by Abusing External Identities`

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Administrator may legitimately invite external guest users.
