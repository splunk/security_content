name: AWS IAM Assume Role Policy Brute Force

description: The following detection identifies any malformed policy document exceptions
  with a status of `failure`. A malformed policy document exception occurs in instances
  where roles are attempted to be assumed, or brute forced. In a brute force attempt,
  using a tool like CloudSploit or Pacu, an attempt will look like `arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-service-role/rds.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForRDS`.  Meaning,
  when an adversary is attempting to identify a role name, multiple failures will
  occur. This detection focuses on the errors of a remote attempt that is failing.
search: '`cloudtrail` (errorCode=MalformedPolicyDocumentException) status=failure
  (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime values(requestParameters.policyName) as policy_name by src eventName eventSource
  aws_account_id errorCode requestParameters.policyDocument userAgent eventID awsRegion
  userIdentity.principalId user_arn | where count >= 2 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_assume_role_policy_brute_force_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS Cloudtrail logs. Set the `where count` greater
  than a value to identify suspicious activity in your environment.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users.
