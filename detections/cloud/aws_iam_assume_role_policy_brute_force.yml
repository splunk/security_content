name: AWS IAM Assume Role Policy Brute Force

type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects multiple failed attempts to assume an
  AWS IAM role, indicating a potential brute force attack. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  logs to identify `MalformedPolicyDocumentException` errors with a status of `failure`
  and filters out legitimate AWS services. This activity is significant as repeated
  failures to assume roles can indicate an adversary attempting to guess role names,
  which is a precursor to unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this could
  lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources, potentially compromising sensitive
  data and services.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail
search: '`cloudtrail` (errorCode=MalformedPolicyDocumentException) status=failure
  (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime values(requestParameters.policyName) as policy_name by src eventName eventSource
  aws_account_id errorCode requestParameters.policyDocument userAgent eventID awsRegion
  userIdentity.principalId user_arn | where count >= 2 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_assume_role_policy_brute_force_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS CloudTrail logs. Set the `where count` greater
  than a value to identify suspicious activity in your environment.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users.
