description: The following analytic identifies an AWS IAM account with concurrent
  sessions originating from more than one unique IP address within a 5-minute span.
  This detection leverages AWS CloudTrail logs, specifically the `DescribeEventAggregates`
  API call, to identify multiple IP addresses associated with the same user session.
  This behavior is significant as it may indicate a session hijacking attack, where
  an adversary uses stolen session cookies to access AWS resources from a different
  location. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow unauthorized access
  to sensitive corporate resources, leading to potential data breaches or further
  exploitation.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also
  represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize
  the threshold to fit your environment.
