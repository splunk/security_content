description: The following analytic identifies an AWS IAM account with concurrent
  sessions coming from more than one unique IP address within the span of 5 minutes.
  This behavior could represent a session hijacking attack whereby an adversary has
  extracted cookies from a victims browser and is using them from a different location
  to access corporate online resources. When a user navigates the AWS Console after
  authentication, the API call with the event name `DescribeEventAggregates` is registered
  in the AWS CloudTrail logs. The Splunk Threat Research team leveraged this event
  name to identify 2 concurrent sessions. The presence of this event occurring from
  two different IP addresses is highly unlikely. As users may behave differently across
  organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their
  environments.

search: ' `amazon_security_lake` api.operation=DescribeEventAggregates "http_request.user_agent"!="AWS Internal" "src_endpoint.domain"!="health.amazonaws.com"

| `security_content_ctime(time)`

| rename cloud.region as region, http_request.user_agent as user_agent, actor.user.account_uid as aws_account_id, actor.user.uid as user

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also
  represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize
  the threshold to fit your environment.
