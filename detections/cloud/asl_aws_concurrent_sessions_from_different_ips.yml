description: The following analytic identifies an AWS IAM account with concurrent
  sessions coming from more than one unique IP address within the span of 5 minutes.
  This behavior could represent a session hijacking attack whereby an adversary has
  extracted cookies from a victims browser and is using them from a different location
  to access corporate online resources. When a user navigates the AWS Console after
  authentication, the API call with the event name `DescribeEventAggregates` is registered
  in the AWS CloudTrail logs. The Splunk Threat Research team leveraged this event
  name to identify 2 concurrent sessions. The presence of this event occurring from
  two different IP addresses is highly unlikely. As users may behave differently across
  organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their
  environments.

search: ' `amazon_security_lake` api.operation=DescribeEventAggregates src_endpoint.domain!="AWS Internal" 
  | bin span=5m _time
  | stats values(src_endpoint.ip) as src_endpoint.ip dc(src_endpoint.ip) as distinct_ip_count 
  by _time identity.user.credential_uid identity.user.name

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-On for AWS Version v7.0.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) that includes includes a merge of all the capabilities of the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Security Lake. This search works with Amazon Security Lake logs which are parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)format. 
known_false_positives: A user with concurrent sessions from different Ips may also
  represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize
  the threshold to fit your environment.
