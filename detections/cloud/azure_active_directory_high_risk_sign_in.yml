description: 'The following analytic triggers on a high risk sign-in against Azure Active Directory identified by Azure Identity Protection. Identity Protection monitors sign-in events
  using heuristics and machine learning to identify potentially malicious events and categorizes them in three categories high, medium and low.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of  Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from  Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events in your Splunk environment.
