description: The following analytic triggers on a high risk sign-in against Azure
  Active Directory identified by Azure Identity Protection. Identity Protection monitors
  sign-in events using heuristics and machine learning to identify potentially malicious
  events and categorizes them in three categories high, medium and low.

 | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user) as user by src_ip, activity, riskLevel, riskEventType, additionalInfo  
 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
 | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
 | `azure_active_directory_high_risk_sign_in_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the RiskyUsers and UserRiskEvents log category in the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype.
known_false_positives: Details for the risk calculation algorithm used by Identity
  Protection are unknown and may be prone to false positives.
