status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects high-risk sign-in attempts against Azure
  Active Directory, identified by Azure Identity Protection. It leverages the RiskyUsers
  and UserRiskEvents log categories from Azure AD events ingested via EventHub. This
  activity is significant as it indicates potentially compromised accounts, flagged
  by heuristics and machine learning. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain
  unauthorized access to sensitive resources, leading to data breaches or further
  exploitation within the environment.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory
search: ' `azure_monitor_aad` category=UserRiskEvents properties.riskLevel=high |
  rename properties.* as * | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  values(user) as user by src_ip, activity, riskLevel, riskEventType, additionalInfo
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `azure_active_directory_high_risk_sign_in_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. Specifically, this analytic leverages the RiskyUsers and UserRiskEvents
  log category in the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype.
known_false_positives: Details for the risk calculation algorithm used by Identity
  Protection are unknown and may be prone to false positives.
