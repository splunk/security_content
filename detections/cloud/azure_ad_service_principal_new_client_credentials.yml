type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects the addition of new credentials to Service
  Principals and Applications in Azure AD. It leverages Azure AD AuditLogs, specifically
  monitoring the "Update application*Certificates and secrets management" operation.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to maintain
  persistent access or escalate privileges within the Azure environment. If confirmed
  malicious, attackers could use these new credentials to log in as the service principal,
  potentially compromising sensitive accounts and resources, leading to unauthorized
  access and control over the Azure environment.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Service Principal client credential modifications may be part
  of legitimate administrative operations. Filter as needed.
