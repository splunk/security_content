description: The following analytic identifies the creation of credentials for Service
  Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure
  AD. These credentials include both x509 certificates and passwords. With sufficient
  permissions, there are a variety of ways to add credentials including the Azure
  Portal, Azure command line interface, and Azure or Az PowerShell modules. Adversaries
  and red teams alike who have obtained privileged access to Azure AD may add credentials
  to Service Principals to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and other
  instances within the Azure environment.

  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
