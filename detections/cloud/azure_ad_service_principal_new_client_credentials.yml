description: The following analytic identifies the addition of new credentials for Service
  Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure
  AD. These credentials include both x509 certificates and passwords. With sufficient
  permissions, there are a variety of ways to add credentials including the Azure
  Portal, Azure command line interface, and Azure or Az PowerShell modules. Adversaries
  and red teams alike who have obtained privileged access to Azure AD may add credentials
  to Service Principals to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and other
  instances within the Azure environment. By compromising an account who is an Owner of an application
  with privileged access, attackers may also escalate their privileges in an Azure AD environment by adding new credentials and 
  logging in as the service principal.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Service Principal client credential modifications may be part
  of legitimate administrative operations. Filter as needed.
