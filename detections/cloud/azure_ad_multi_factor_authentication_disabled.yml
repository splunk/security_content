description: The following analytic identifies an attempt to disable multi-factor
  authentication for an Azure AD user. An adversary who has obtained access to an
  Azure AD tenant may disable multi-factor authentication as a way to plant a backdoor
  and maintain persistence using a valid account. This way the attackers can keep
  persistance in the environment without adding new users.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Legitimate use case may require for users to disable MFA. Filter
  as needed.
