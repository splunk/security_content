description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a new Azure Automation
  account within an Azure tenant. Azure Automation is a cloud-based automation platform
  that allows administrators to automate Azure management tasks and orchestrate actions
  across external systems within Azure using PowerShell and Python. Azure Automation
  can also be configured to automate tasks on on premise infrastructure using a component
  called a Hybrid Runbook Worker. Automation accounts serve as a container to isolate
  Automation resources, runbooks, assets, and configurations from the resources of
  other accounts. They allow administrators to separate resources into logical environments
  or delegated responsibilities. Adversaries or red teams who have obtained privileged
  access to an Azure tenant may create an Azure Automation account with elevated privileges
  to maintain persistence in the Azure tenant. A malicious Automation Runbook can
  be created to create Global Administrators in Azure AD, execute code on VMs, etc.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Audit events into your Splunk environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the Azure Activity log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately create Azure Automation accounts.
