description: This search establishes, on a per-hour basis, the average and the standard
  deviation of the number of API calls that were related to network ACLs made by each
  user. Also recorded is the number of data points for each user. This table is then
  outputted to a lookup file to allow the detection search to operate quickly.
search: '`cloudtrail` `network_acl_events` | spath output=arn path=userIdentity.arn
  | bucket _time span=1h | stats count as apiCalls by _time, arn | stats count(apiCalls)
  as numDataPoints, latest(apiCalls) as latestCount, avg(apiCalls) as avgApiCalls,
  stdev(apiCalls) as stdevApiCalls by arn | table arn, latestCount, numDataPoints,

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS version (4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. To add or remove API event names for network ACLs, edit the macro `network_acl_events`.
