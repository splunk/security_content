description: The following analytic detects the assignment of high-risk Graph API permissions in Azure AD, specifically Application.ReadWrite.All, AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, and RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory. It uses azure_monitor_aad data to scan AuditLogs for 'Update application' operations, identifying when these permissions are assigned. This activity is significant as it grants broad control over Azure AD, including application and directory settings. If confirmed malicious, it could lead to unauthorized modifications and potential security breaches, compromising the integrity and security of the Azure AD environment. Immediate investigation is required.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Privileged Graph API permissions may be assigned for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
