description: The following analytic identifies a single source IP failing to authenticate
  into Google Workspace with multiple valid users, potentially indicating a Password
  Spraying attack. It uses Google Workspace login failure events and calculates the
  standard deviation for source IPs, applying the 3-sigma rule to detect unusual failed
  authentication attempts. This activity is significant as it may signal an adversary
  attempting to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further exploitation within
  the environment.
data_source:
- Google Workspace login_failure
search: '`gws_reports_login` event.type = login event.name = login_failure| bucket
  span=5m _time | stats  dc(user_name) AS unique_accounts values(user_name) as tried_accounts
  values(authentication_method) AS authentication_method by _time, src | eventstats  avg(unique_accounts)
  as ip_avg , stdev(unique_accounts) as ip_std by _time | eval  upperBound=(ip_avg+ip_std*3)
  | eval  isOutlier=if(unique_accounts > 10 and unique_accounts >= upperBound, 1,
  0) | where isOutlier =1| `gcp_unusual_number_of_failed_authentications_from_ip_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google
  Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows
  Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google
  Workspace APIs. We would also recommend tuning the detection by adjusting the window
  `span` and `unique_accounts` threshold values according to your environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the User log events.
known_false_positives: No known false positives for this detection. Please review
