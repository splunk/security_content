description: The following analytic identifies one source IP failing to authenticate
  into the Google Workspace with multiple valid users. This behavior could represent
  an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against a Google Workspace enviroment
  to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. The detection calculates the standard
  deviation for source IP and leverages the 3-sigma statistical rule to identify an
  unusual number of failed authentication attempts. To customize this analytic, users
  can try different combinations of the bucket span time and the calculation of the
  upperBound field. This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well
  as threat hunting exercises.  While looking for anomalies using statistical methods
  like the standard deviation can have benefits, we also recommend using threshold-based
  detections to complement coverage. A similar analytic following the threshold model
  is `GCP Multiple Users Failing To Authenticate From Ip`
data_source: 
- Google Workspace login_failure
search: '`gws_reports_login` event.type = login event.name = login_failure| bucket
  span=5m _time | stats  dc(user_name) AS unique_accounts values(user_name) as tried_accounts
  values(authentication_method) AS authentication_method by _time, src | eventstats  avg(unique_accounts)
  as ip_avg , stdev(unique_accounts) as ip_std by _time | eval  upperBound=(ip_avg+ip_std*3)
  | eval  isOutlier=if(unique_accounts > 10 and unique_accounts >= upperBound, 1,
  0) | where isOutlier =1| `gcp_unusual_number_of_failed_authentications_from_ip_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google
  Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows
  Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google
  Workspace APIs. We would also recommend tuning the detection by adjusting the window
  `span` and `unique_accounts` threshold values according to your environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the User log events.
known_false_positives: No known false positives for this detection. Please review
