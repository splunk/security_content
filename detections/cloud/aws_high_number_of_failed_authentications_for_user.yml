description: The following analytic detects an AWS account experiencing more than
  20 failed authentication attempts within a 5-minute window. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  logs to identify multiple failed ConsoleLogin events. This behavior is significant
  as it may indicate a brute force attack targeting the account. If confirmed malicious,
  the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access, leading to data breaches
  or further exploitation of the AWS environment. Security teams should consider adjusting
  the threshold based on their specific environment to reduce false positives.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats dc(_raw) AS failed_attempts values(src_ip) as src_ip values(user_agent)
  by _time, user_name, eventName, eventSource aws_account_id | where failed_attempts
  > 20 | `aws_high_number_of_failed_authentications_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: A user with more than 20 failed authentication attempts in
  the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
