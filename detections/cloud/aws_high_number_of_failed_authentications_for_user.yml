type: Anomaly
datamodel: []
description: The following analytic identifies an AWS IAM User account with more than 20 failed authentication events in the span of 10 minutes. This behavior could represent a brute force attack against the account. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the threshold of this detection.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure | bucket span=10m _time | stats dc(_raw) AS failed_attempts values(src_ip) as src_ip values(user_agent)  by _time, user_name, eventName, eventSource aws_account_id | where failed_attempts > 20 | `aws_high_number_of_failed_authentications_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately triggered an AWS audit tool activity which may trigger this event.
