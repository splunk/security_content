type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies an AWS account with more than 20 failed
  authentication events in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior could represent a
  brute force attack against the account. As environments differ across organizations,
  security teams should customize the threshold of this detection.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats dc(_raw) AS failed_attempts values(src_ip) as src_ip values(user_agent)
  by _time, user_name, eventName, eventSource aws_account_id | where failed_attempts
  > 20 | `aws_high_number_of_failed_authentications_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: A user with more than 20 failed authentication attempts in
  the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
