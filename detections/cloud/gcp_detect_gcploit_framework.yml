description: The following analytic identifies the use of the GCPloit exploitation
  framework within Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It detects specific GCP Pub/Sub messages
  with a function timeout of 539 seconds, which is indicative of GCPloit activity.
  This detection is significant as GCPloit can be used to escalate privileges and
  facilitate lateral movement from compromised high-privilege accounts. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate
  their privileges, and move laterally within the GCP environment, potentially compromising
  sensitive data and critical resources.
data_source: []
search: '`google_gcp_pubsub_message` data.protoPayload.request.function.timeout=539s
  | table src src_user data.resource.labels.project_id data.protoPayload.request.function.serviceAccountEmail
  data.protoPayload.authorizationInfo{}.permission data.protoPayload.request.location
  http_user_agent | `gcp_detect_gcploit_framework_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk GCP add-on. This search works with gcp:pubsub:message
  logs
known_false_positives: Payload.request.function.timeout value can possibly be match
  with other functions or requests however the source user and target request account
  may indicate an attempt to move laterally accross acounts or projects
