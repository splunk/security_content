description: This search is to detect a shared file in google drive with suspicious
  file name that are commonly used by spear phishing campaign. This technique is very
  popular to lure the user by running a malicious document or click a malicious link
  within the shared file that will redirected to malicious website. This detection
  can also catch some normal email communication between organization and its external
  customer.
search: '`gsuite_drive` parameters.owner_is_team_drive=false "parameters.doc_title"
  IN ("*dhl*", "* ups *", "*delivery*", "*parcel*", "*label*", "*invoice*", "*postal*",
  "*fedex*", "* usps *", "* express *", "*shipment*", "*Banking/Tax*","*shipment*",
  "*new order*") parameters.doc_type IN ("document","pdf", "msexcel", "msword", "spreadsheet",
  "presentation") | rex field=parameters.owner "[^@]+@(?<source_domain>[^@]+)" | rex
  field=parameters.target_user "[^@]+@(?<dest_domain>[^@]+)" | where not source_domain="internal_test_email.com"
  and dest_domain="internal_test_email.com" | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="low"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by email parameters.owner
  parameters.target_user parameters.doc_title parameters.doc_type phase severity |
  rename parameters.target_user AS user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `gsuite_suspicious_shared_file_name_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc. In order
  for the search to work for your environment, please edit the query to use your company
  specific email domain instead of `internal_test_email.com`.
known_false_positives: normal user or normal transaction may contain the subject and
  file type attachment that this detection try to search
