description: The following analytic detects shared files in Google Drive with suspicious filenames commonly used in spear phishing campaigns. It leverages GSuite Drive logs to identify documents with titles that include keywords like "dhl," "ups," "invoice," and "shipment." This activity is significant because such filenames are often used to lure users into opening malicious documents or clicking harmful links. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or further compromise of the user's system.

- G Suite Drive

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc. In order for the search to work for your environment, please edit the query to use your company specific email domain instead of `internal_test_email.com`.
known_false_positives: normal user or normal transaction may contain the subject and file type attachment that this detection try to search
