description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user A(victim A)
  creates a login profile for user B, followed by a AWS Console login event from user
  B from the same src_ip as user B. This correlated event can be indicative of privilege
  escalation since both events happened from the same src_ip
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = CreateLoginProfile | rename requestParameters.userName
  as new_login_profile | table src_ip eventName new_login_profile userIdentity.userName  |
  join new_login_profile src_ip [| search `cloudtrail` eventName = ConsoleLogin |
  rename userIdentity.userName  as new_login_profile | stats count values(eventName)
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by eventSource aws_account_id errorCode
  userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn new_login_profile
  src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`]
  | `aws_createloginprofile_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a login profile for another user.
