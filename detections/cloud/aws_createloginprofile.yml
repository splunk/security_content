description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user A(victim A) creates a login profile for user B, followed by a AWS Console login event from user B from the same src_ip as user B. This correlated event can be indicative of privilege escalation since both events happened from the same src_ip
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = CreateLoginProfile 
| rename requestParameters.userName as new_login_profile 
| table src_ip eventName new_login_profile userName
| join new_login_profile src_ip 
    [| search `cloudtrail` eventName = ConsoleLogin 
    | rename userName as new_login_profile | table eventName new_login_profile src_ip ]|`aws_createloginprofile_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a login profile for another user.
