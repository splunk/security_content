description: The following analytic detects AWS cloudtrail events where bucket versioning is suspended by a user. Versioning allows the AWS Administrators to maintain different version of the S3 bucket which can be used to recover deleted data. Adversaries have leveraged this technique in the wild during a ransomware incident to disable versioning so the client cannot recover the data.

|  stats count values(requestParameters.bucketName) as bucket_name values(resources{}.ARN) as resource_arn by src_ip aws_account_id awsRegion eventName userAgent user_arn userIdentity.principalId  errorCode | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `aws_disable_bucket_versioning_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS Administrator has legitimately disabled versioning on certain buckets to avoid costs.
