description: The following analytic detects when AWS S3 bucket versioning is suspended
  by a user. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify `PutBucketVersioning` events
  with the `VersioningConfiguration.Status` set to `Suspended`. This activity is significant
  because disabling versioning can prevent recovery of deleted or modified data, which
  is a common tactic in ransomware attacks. If confirmed malicious, this action could
  lead to data loss and hinder recovery efforts, severely impacting data integrity
  and availability.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName= PutBucketVersioning "requestParameters.VersioningConfiguration.Status"=Suspended
  |  stats count values(requestParameters.bucketName) as bucket_name values(resources{}.ARN)
  as resource_arn by src_ip aws_account_id awsRegion eventName userAgent user_arn
  userIdentity.principalId  errorCode | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `aws_disable_bucket_versioning_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS Administrator has legitimately disabled
  versioning on certain buckets to avoid costs.
