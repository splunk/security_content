description: The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) requests to an AWS Console for a single user. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  logs, specifically the `additionalEventData` field, to detect more than 10 failed
  MFA prompts within 5 minutes. This activity is significant as it may indicate an
  adversary attempting to bypass MFA by bombarding the user with repeated authentication
  requests. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to the
  AWS environment, potentially compromising sensitive data and resources.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName= ConsoleLogin "additionalEventData.MFAUsed"=Yes errorMessage="Failed
  authentication" | bucket span=5m _time |  stats dc(_raw) as mfa_prompts values(userAgent)
  as userAgent values(src) as src by _time user_name user_arn aws_account_id eventName
  errorMessage | where mfa_prompts > 10| `aws_multiple_failed_mfa_requests_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on is required to utilize this data. The search
  requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication
  or application issues. Filter as needed.
