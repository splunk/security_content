description: The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication
  requests to an AWS Console for a single user. AWS CloudTrail logs provide a a very
  useful field called `additionalEventData` that logs information regarding usage
  of MFA. Specifically, the analytic triggers when more than 10 MFA user prompts fail
  within 10 minutes. AWS Environments can be very different depending on the organization,
  Security teams should test this detection and customize these arbitrary thresholds.
  The detected behavior may represent an adversary who has obtained legitimate credentials
  for a user and continuously repeats login attempts in order to bombard users with
  MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls potentially resulting in the
  user finally accepting the authentication request. Threat actors like the Lapsus
  team and APT29 have leveraged this technique to bypass multi-factor authentication
  controls as reported by Mandiant and others.
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName= ConsoleLogin "additionalEventData.MFAUsed"=Yes errorMessage="Failed
  authentication" | bucket span=5m _time |  stats dc(_raw) as mfa_prompts values(userAgent)
  as userAgent values(src) as src by _time user_name user_arn aws_account_id eventName
  errorMessage | where mfa_prompts > 10| `aws_multiple_failed_mfa_requests_for_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on is required to utilize this data. The search
  requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication
  or application issues. Filter as needed.
