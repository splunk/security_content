description: The following analytic detects when multi-factor authentication (MFA) is disabled for an AWS IAM user. It operates by monitoring for 
  specific API calls that deactivate MFA, signaling a potential unauthorized attempt to weaken account security. This behavior is critical for a 
  Security Operations Center (SOC) to identify, as disabling MFA removes a significant barrier against unauthorized access, making accounts more 
  vulnerable to compromise. The impact of such an attack is substantial, as it allows adversaries to maintain access within the environment with 
  less risk of detection, facilitating further malicious activities.

search: '`amazon_security_lake` (api.operation=DeleteVirtualMFADevice OR api.operation=DeactivateMFADevice) | fillnull 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by api.operation actor.user.account_uid actor.user.uid http_request.user_agent src_endpoint.ip cloud.region
  | rename actor.user.uid as user, src_endpoint.ip as src_ip, cloud.region as region, http_request.user_agent as user_agent, actor.user.account_uid as aws_account_id

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides 
  security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search,
  ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or 
  the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: AWS Administrators may disable MFA but it is highly unlikely
  for this event to occur without prior notice to the company
