description: The following analytic detects attempts to disable multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) for an AWS IAM user. It leverages Amazon Security Lake logs, specifically
  monitoring for `DeleteVirtualMFADevice` or `DeactivateMFADevice` API operations.
  This activity is significant as disabling MFA can indicate an adversary attempting
  to weaken account security to maintain persistence using a compromised account.
  If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to retain access to the
  AWS environment without detection, potentially leading to unauthorized access to
  sensitive resources and prolonged compromise.
data_source: []
search: '`amazon_security_lake` (api.operation=DeleteVirtualMFADevice OR api.operation=DeactivateMFADevice)
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by api.operation
  actor.user.account_uid actor.user.uid http_request.user_agent src_endpoint.ip cloud.region
  | rename actor.user.uid as user, src_endpoint.ip as src_ip, cloud.region as region,
  http_request.user_agent as user_agent, actor.user.account_uid as aws_account_id
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `asl_aws_multi_factor_authentication_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon
  Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related
  data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from
  Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events
  using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876)
  or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: AWS Administrators may disable MFA but it is highly unlikely
  for this event to occur without prior notice to the company
