description: This search will detect a spike in the number of API calls made to your
  cloud infrastructure environment by a user.
search: '| tstats count as api_calls values(All_Changes.command) as command from datamodel=Change
  where All_Changes.user!=unknown All_Changes.status=success by All_Changes.user _time
  span=1h | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | eval HourOfDay=strftime(_time,
  "%H") | eval HourOfDay=floor(HourOfDay/4)*4 | eval DayOfWeek=strftime(_time, "%w")
  | eval isWeekend=if(DayOfWeek >= 1 AND DayOfWeek <= 5, 0, 1) | join user HourOfDay

  isOutlier | where isOutlier=1 | eval expected_upper_threshold = mvindex(split(mvindex(BoundaryRanges,
  -1), ":"), 0) | where api_calls > expected_upper_threshold | eval distance_from_threshold
  = api_calls - expected_upper_threshold | table _time, user, command, api_calls,
  expected_upper_threshold, distance_from_threshold | `abnormally_high_number_of_cloud_infrastructure_api_calls_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs. You also must
  run the baseline search `Baseline Of Cloud Infrastructure API Calls Per User` to
  create the probability density function.
