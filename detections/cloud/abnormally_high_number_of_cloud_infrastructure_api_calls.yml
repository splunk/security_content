description: This search will detect a spike in the number of API calls made to your
  cloud infrastructure environment by a user.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs. You also must
  run the baseline search `Baseline Of Cloud Infrastructure API Calls Per User` to
  create the probability density function.
