description: This search will detect spike in blocked outbound network connections
  originating from within your AWS environment.  It will also update the cache file
  that factors in the latest data.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your VPC Flow
  logs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit
  your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the number of data points
  required to meet the definition of "spike." The `deviationThreshold` variable is
  the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be
  considered a spike. This search works best when you run the "Baseline of Blocked
  Outbound Connection" support search once to create a history of previously seen
  blocked outbound connections.

known_false_positives: The false-positive rate may vary based on the values of`dataPointThreshold`
  and `deviationThreshold`. Additionally, false positives may result when AWS administrators
  roll out policies enforcing network blocks, causing sudden increases in the number
  of blocked outbound connections.
