data_source:
- Azure Active Directory Sign-in activity
description: The following analytic identifies instances where a user has denied consent to an OAuth application seeking permissions within the Azure AD environment. This detection leverages Azure AD's audit logs, specifically focusing on user consent actions with error code 65004. Monitoring denied consent actions is significant as it can indicate users recognizing potentially suspicious or untrusted applications. If confirmed malicious, this activity could suggest attempts by unauthorized applications to gain access, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions within the environment. Understanding these denials helps refine security policies and enhance user awareness.
search: '`azure_monitor_aad` operationName="Sign-in activity" properties.status.errorCode=65004 | rename properties.* as * | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by operationName, user, appDisplayName, status.failureReason | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `azure_ad_user_consent_denied_for_oauth_application_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Users may deny consent for legitimate applications by mistake, filter as needed.
