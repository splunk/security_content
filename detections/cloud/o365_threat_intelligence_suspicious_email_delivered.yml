description: The following analytic identifies when a suspicious email is detected within the Microsoft Office 365 ecosystem through the Advanced Threat Protection engine and delivered to an end user. Attackers may execute several attacks through email, any detections from built-in Office 365 capabilities should be monitored and responded to appropriately. Certain premium Office 365 capabilities such as Safe Attachment and Safe Links further enhance these detection and response functions.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events. The threat intelligence workload is typically only visible to E3/E5 level customers.
