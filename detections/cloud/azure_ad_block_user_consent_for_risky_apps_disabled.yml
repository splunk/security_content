- Azure Active Directory Update authorization policy
description: The following analytic detects when the risk-based step-up consent security
  setting in Azure AD is disabled. It monitors Azure Active Directory logs for the
  "Update authorization policy" operation, specifically changes to the "AllowUserConsentForRiskyApps"
  setting. This activity is significant because disabling this feature can expose
  the organization to OAuth phishing threats by allowing users to grant consent to
  potentially malicious applications. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain
  unauthorized access to user data and sensitive information, leading to data breaches
  and further compromise within the organization.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Legitimate changes to the 'risk-based step-up consent' setting
  by administrators, perhaps as part of a policy update or security assessment, may
  trigger this alert, necessitating verification of the change's intent and authorization
