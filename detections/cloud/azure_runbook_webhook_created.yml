description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a new Automation Runbook
  Webhook within an Azure tenant. Azure Automation is a cloud-based automation platform
  that allows administrators to automate Azure management tasks and orchestrate actions
  across external systems within Azure. Azure Automation script files called Runbooks
  that can be written in PowerShell or Python. One of the ways administrators can
  configure a Runbook to be executed is through HTTP Webhooks. Webhooks leverage custom
  unauthenticated URLs that are exposed to the Internet. An adversary who has obtained
  privileged access to an Azure tenant may create a Webhook to trigger the execution
  of an Automation Runbook with malicious code that can create users or execute code
  on a VM. This provides a persistent foothold on the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Audit events into your Splunk environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the Azure Activity log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately create Azure Runbook Webhooks.
  Filter as needed.
