  eventNames which starts with Describe by a single user. This indicates that this
  user scans the configuration of your AWS cloud environment.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=Describe* OR eventName=List* OR eventName=Get*  |
  stats dc(eventName) as dc_events min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  values(eventName) as eventName values(src) as src values(userAgent) as userAgent
  by user userIdentity.arn | where dc_events > 50 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|`aws_excessive_security_scanning_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
