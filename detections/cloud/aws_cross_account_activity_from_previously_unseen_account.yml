name: AWS Cross Account Activity From Previously Unseen Account

description: The following analytic identifies AssumeRole events where an IAM role
  in a different AWS account is accessed for the first time. It detects this activity
  by analyzing authentication logs and comparing the requesting and requested account
  IDs, flagging new cross-account activities. This behavior is significant because
  unauthorized cross-account access can indicate potential lateral movement or privilege
  escalation attempts. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized
  access to resources in another account, potentially leading to data exfiltration,
  service disruption, or further compromise of the AWS environment.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen AWS Cross Account
  Activity - Initial` to build the initial table of source IP address, geographic
  locations, and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously
  Seen AWS Cross Account Activity - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age
  out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing
  the `aws_cross_account_activity_from_previously_unseen_account_filter` macro.
known_false_positives: Using multiple AWS accounts and roles is perfectly valid behavior.
  It's suspicious when an account requests privileges of an account it hasn't before.
  You should validate with the account owner that this is a legitimate request.
