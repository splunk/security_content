how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen AWS Cross Account
  Activity - Initial` to build the initial table of source IP address, geographic
  locations, and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously
  Seen AWS Cross Account Activity - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age
  out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing
  the `aws_cross_account_activity_from_previously_unseen_account_filter` macro.
known_false_positives: Using multiple AWS accounts and roles is perfectly valid behavior.
  It's suspicious when an account requests privileges of an account it hasn't before.
  You should validate with the account owner that this is a legitimate request.
