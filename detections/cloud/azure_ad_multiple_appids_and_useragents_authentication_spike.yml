- Azure Active Directory Sign-in activity
description: The following analytic detects unusual authentication activity in Azure AD, specifically when a single user account has over 8 authentication attempts using 3+ unique application IDs and 5+ unique user agents within a short period. It leverages Azure AD audit logs, focusing on authentication events and using statistical thresholds. This behavior is significant as it may indicate an adversary probing for MFA requirements. If confirmed malicious, it suggests a compromised account, potentially leading to further exploitation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Early detection is crucial to prevent substantial harm.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Rapid authentication from the same user using more than 5 different user agents and 3 application IDs is highly unlikely under normal circumstances. However, there are potential scenarios that could lead to false positives.
