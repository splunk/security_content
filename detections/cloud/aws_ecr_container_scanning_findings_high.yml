description: The following analytic identifies high-severity findings from AWS Elastic
  Container Registry (ECR) image scans. It detects these activities by analyzing AWS
  CloudTrail logs for the DescribeImageScanFindings event, specifically filtering
  for findings with a high severity level. This activity is significant for a SOC
  because high-severity vulnerabilities in container images can lead to potential
  exploitation if not addressed. If confirmed malicious, attackers could exploit these
  vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or escalate
  privileges within the container environment, posing a significant risk to the overall
  security posture.

how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
