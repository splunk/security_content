description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events from Amazon Security Lake where a user is making successful
  API calls to view/update/delete the existing password policy in an AWS organization.
  It is unlikely for a regular user to conduct this operation. These events may potentially
  be malicious, adversaries often use this information to gain more understanding
  of the password defenses in place and exploit them to increase their attack surface
  when a user account is compromised.

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-On for AWS Version v7.0.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) that includes includes a merge of all the capabilities of the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Security Lake. This search works with Amazon Security Lake logs which are parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)format. 
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately triggered an AWS audit tool activity which may
  trigger this event.
