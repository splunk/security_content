description: This search looks for cloud provisioning activities from previously unseen
  countries. Provisioning activities are defined broadly as any event that runs or
  creates something.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider.  You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Provisioning
  Activity Sources - Initial` to build the initial table of source IP address, geographic
  locations, and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously
  Seen Cloud Provisioning Activity Sources - Update` to keep this table up to date
  and to age out old data. You can adjust the time window for this search by updating
  the `previously_unseen_cloud_provisioning_activity_window` macro. You can also provide
  additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_provisioning_activity_from_previously_unseen_country_filter`
  macro.

known_false_positives: "This is a strictly behavioral search, so we define \"false\
  \ positive\" slightly differently. Every time this fires, it will accurately reflect\
  \ the first occurrence in the time period you're searching within, plus what is\
  \ stored in the cache feature. But while there are really no \"false positives\"\
  \ in a traditional sense, there is definitely lots of noise.\\\n This search will\
  \ fire any time a new IP address is seen in the **GeoIP** database for any kind\
  \ of provisioning activity. If you typically do all provisioning from tools inside\
  \ of your country, there should be few false positives. If you are located in countries\
  \ where the free version of **MaxMind GeoIP** that ships by default with Splunk\
  \ has weak resolution (particularly small countries in less economically powerful\
  \ regions), this may be much less valuable to you."
