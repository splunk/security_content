description: The following analytic identifies when cross-tenant access/synchronization policies are changed in an Azure tenant. Adversaries have been observed altering victim cross-tenant policies as a method of lateral movement or maintaining persistent access to compromised environments. These policies should be considered sensitive and monitored for changes and/or loose configuration.

  | eval user = case(match(mvindex('Actor{}.ID',-1),"User"),mvindex('Actor{}.ID',0),match(mvindex('Actor{}.ID',-1),"ServicePrincipal"),mvindex('Actor{}.ID',3),true(),mvindex('Actor{}.ID',0))
  | stats values(Workload) as category, values(ClientIP) as src, values(ModifiedProperties{}.Name) as object_name, values(ModifiedProperties{}.NewValue) as object_attrs, count, min(_time) as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime by Id,user,Operation
  | rename Operation as signature, Id as signature_id
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_cross_tenant_access_change_filter`
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events. 
known_false_positives: Business approved changes by known administrators.
