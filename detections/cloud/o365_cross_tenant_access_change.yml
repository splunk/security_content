description: The following analytic identifies when cross-tenant access/synchronization policies are changed in an Azure tenant. Adversaries have been observed altering victim cross-tenant policies as a method of lateral movement or maintaining persistent access to compromised environments. These policies should be considered sensitive and monitored for changes and/or loose configuration.

- Office 365 Universal Audit Log

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Business approved changes by known administrators.
