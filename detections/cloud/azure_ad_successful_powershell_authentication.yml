description: The following analytic identifies a successful authentication event against
  an Azure AD tenant using PowerShell cmdlets. This detection leverages Azure AD SignInLogs
  to identify successful logins where the appDisplayName is "Microsoft Azure PowerShell."
  This activity is significant because it is uncommon for regular, non-administrative
  users to authenticate using PowerShell, and it may indicate enumeration and discovery
  techniques by an attacker. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to perform extensive reconnaissance, potentially leading to privilege escalation
  or further exploitation within the Azure environment.
data_source:
- Azure Active Directory
search: ' `azure_monitor_aad`  category=SignInLogs properties.authenticationDetails{}.succeeded=true
  properties.appDisplayName="Microsoft Azure PowerShell" | rename properties.*  as
  * | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user) as user
  by src_ip, appDisplayName, user_agent | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `azure_ad_successful_powershell_authentication_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Administrative users will likely use PowerShell commandlets
  to troubleshoot and maintain the environment. Filter as needed.
