description: The following analytic identifies a successful authentication event against
  an Azure AD tenant using PowerShell commandlets. This behavior is not common for
  regular, non administrative users. After compromising an account in Azure AD, attackers
  and red teams  alike will perform enumeration and discovery techniques. One method
  of executing these techniques is leveraging the native PowerShell modules.

 | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user) as user by src_ip, appDisplayName, user_agent
 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
 | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
 | `azure_ad_successful_powershell_authentication_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Administrative users will likely use PowerShell commandlets
  to troubleshoot and maintain the environment. Filter as needed.
