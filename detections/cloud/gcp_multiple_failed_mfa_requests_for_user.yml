description: The following analytic detects multiple failed multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) requests for a single user within a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tenant. It
  triggers when 10 or more MFA prompts fail within a 5-minute window, using Google
  Workspace login failure events. This behavior is significant as it may indicate
  an adversary attempting to bypass MFA by bombarding the user with repeated authentication
  requests. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access,
  allowing attackers to compromise accounts and potentially escalate privileges within
  the GCP environment.
data_source:
- Google Workspace login_failure
search: "`gws_reports_login` event.name=login_failure `gws_login_mfa_methods` | bucket
  span=5m _time | stats dc(_raw) AS mfa_prompts values(user) AS user by src_ip, login_challenge_method,\
  \  _time | where mfa_prompts >= 10 | `gcp_multiple_failed_mfa_requests_for_user_filter`"
how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google
  Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows
  Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google
  Workspace APIs. We would also recommend tuning the detection by adjusting the window
  `span` and `mfa_prompts` threshold values according to your environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the User log events.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication
  or application issues. Filter as needed.
