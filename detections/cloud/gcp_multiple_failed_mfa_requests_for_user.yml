description: The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication
  requests for a single user within a Google Cloud Platform tenant. Specifically,
  the analytic triggers when 10 or more MFA user prompts fail within 5 minutes. Google
  CLoud tenants can be very different depending on the organization, Security teams
  should test this detection and customize these arbitrary thresholds. The detected
  behavior may represent an adversary who has obtained legitimate credentials for
  a user and continuously repeats login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA
  push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls potentially resulting in the user
  finally accepting the authentication request. Threat actors like the Lapsus team
  and APT29 have leveraged this technique to bypass multi-factor authentication controls
  as reported by Mandiant and others.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google
  Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows
  Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google
  Workspace APIs. We would also recommend tuning the detection by adjusting the window
  `span` and `mfa_prompts` threshold values according to your environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the User log events.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication
  or application issues. Filter as needed.
