description: This analytic identifies `PutBucketLifecycle` events in CloudTrail logs
  where a user has created a new lifecycle rule for an S3 bucket with a short expiration
  period. Attackers may use this API call to impair the CloudTrail logging by removing
  logs from the S3 bucket by changing the object expiration day to 1 day, in which
  case the CloudTrail logs will be deleted.

  |  spath path=requestParameters{}.LifecycleConfiguration{}.Rule{}.Expiration{}.Days

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in
  your AWS Environment. We recommend our users to set the expiration days value according
  to your company's log retention policies.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that it is a legitimate admin activity. Please consider filtering out these noisy
  events using userAgent, user_arn field names.
