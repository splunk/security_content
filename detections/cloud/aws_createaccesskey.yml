description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user A who has already
  permission to create access keys, makes an API call to create access keys for another
  user B. Attackers have been know to use this technique for Privilege Escalation
  in case new victim(user B) has more permissions than old victim(user B)
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = CreateAccessKey userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com
  errorCode = success| search userName!=requestParameters.userName  |  stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  by requestParameters.userName src
  eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId
  user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|`aws_createaccesskey_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created keys for another user.
