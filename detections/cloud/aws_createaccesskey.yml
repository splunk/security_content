description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events where a user A who has already
  permission to create access keys, makes an API call to create access keys for another
  user B. Attackers have been know to use this technique for Privilege Escalation
  in case new victim(user B) has more permissions than old victim(user B)
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = CreateAccessKey userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com
  errorCode = success| search userIdentity.userName!=requestParameters.userName  |  stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  by requestParameters.userName
  src eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode userAgent eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId
  user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|`aws_createaccesskey_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created keys for another user.
