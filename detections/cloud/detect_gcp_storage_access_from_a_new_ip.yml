description: The following analytic identifies access to GCP Storage buckets from
  new or previously unseen remote IP addresses. It leverages GCP Storage bucket-access
  logs ingested via Cloud Pub/Sub and compares current access events against a lookup
  table of previously seen IP addresses. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  unauthorized access or potential reconnaissance by an attacker. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized data manipulation, or further
  compromise of the GCP environment.

how_to_implement: This search relies on the Splunk Add-on for Google Cloud Platform,
  setting up a Cloud Pub/Sub input, along with the relevant GCP PubSub topics and
  logging sink to capture GCP Storage Bucket events (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/overview).
  In order to capture public GCP Storage Bucket access logs, you must also enable
  storage bucket logging to your PubSub Topic as per https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-logs.  These
  logs are deposited into the nominated Storage Bucket on an hourly basis and typically
  show up by 15 minutes past the hour.  It is recommended to configure any saved searches
  or correlation searches in Enterprise Security to run on an hourly basis at 30 minutes
  past the hour (cron definition of 30 * * * *).  A lookup table (previously_seen_gcp_storage_access_from_remote_ip.csv)
  stores the previously seen access requests, and is used by this search to determine
  any newly seen IP addresses accessing the Storage Buckets.
known_false_positives: GCP Storage buckets can be accessed from any IP (if the ACLs
  are open to allow it), as long as it can make a successful connection. This will
  be a false postive, since the search is looking for a new IP within the past two
  hours.
