name: Kubernetes Scanning by Unauthenticated IP Address

description: The following analytic identifies potential scanning activities within
  a Kubernetes environment by unauthenticated IP addresses. It leverages Kubernetes
  audit logs to detect multiple unauthorized access attempts (HTTP 403 responses)
  from the same source IP. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attacker
  probing for vulnerabilities or attempting to exploit known issues. If confirmed
  malicious, such scanning could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further
  exploitation of the Kubernetes infrastructure, compromising the security and integrity
  of the environment.
data_source:

how_to_implement: You must ingest Kubernetes audit logs.
