description: This search looks for cloud compute instances being created with previously
  unseen image IDs.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Images
  - Initial` to build the initial table of images observed and times. You must also
  enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Images - Update`
  to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional
  filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_with_previously_unseen_image_filter`
  macro.

known_false_positives: After a new image is created, the first systems created with
  that image will cause this alert to fire.  Verify that the image being used was
  created by a legitimate user.
