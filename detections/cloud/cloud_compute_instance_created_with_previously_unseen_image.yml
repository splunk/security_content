description: This search looks for cloud compute instances being created with previously
  unseen image IDs.
search: '| tstats count earliest(_time) as firstTime, latest(_time) as lastTime values(All_Changes.object_id)
  as dest from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.action=created by All_Changes.Instance_Changes.image_id,
  All_Changes.user | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | `drop_dm_object_name("Instance_Changes")`
  | where image_id != "unknown" | lookup previously_seen_cloud_compute_images image_id
  as image_id OUTPUT firstTimeSeen, enough_data | eventstats max(enough_data) as enough_data
  | where enough_data=1 | eval firstTimeSeenImage=min(firstTimeSeen) | where isnull(firstTimeSeenImage)
  OR firstTimeSeenImage > relative_time(now(), "-24h@h") | table firstTime, user,
  image_id, count, dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `cloud_compute_instance_created_with_previously_unseen_image_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Images
  - Initial` to build the initial table of images observed and times. You must also
  enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Images - Update`
  to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional
  filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_with_previously_unseen_image_filter`
  macro.
known_false_positives: After a new image is created, the first systems created with
  that image will cause this alert to fire.  Verify that the image being used was
  created by a legitimate user.
