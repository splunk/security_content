name: Abnormally High Number Of Cloud Instances Destroyed

description: The following analytic identifies an abnormally high number of cloud instances being destroyed within a 4-hour period. It leverages cloud infrastructure logs and applies a probability density model to detect outliers. This activity is significant for a SOC because a sudden spike in destroyed instances could indicate malicious activity, such as an insider threat or a compromised account attempting to disrupt services. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to significant operational disruptions, data loss, and potential financial impact due to the destruction of critical cloud resources.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs. You also must run the baseline search `Baseline Of Cloud Instances Destroyed` to create the probability density function.
known_false_positives: Many service accounts configured within a cloud infrastructure are known to exhibit this behavior. Please adjust the threshold values and filter out service accounts from the output. Always verify if this search alerted on a human user.
