description: This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events wherein a console login event
  by a user was recorded within the last hour, then compares the event to a lookup
  file of previously seen users (by ARN values) who have logged into the console.
  The alert is fired if the user has logged into the console for the first time within
  the last hour

search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Authentication
  where Authentication.signature=ConsoleLogin by Authentication.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Authentication)`

how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version
  5.1.0 or later) and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates
  to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Run the `Previously Seen Users
  in CloudTrail - Initial` support search only once to create a baseline of previously
  seen IAM users within the last 30 days. Run `Previously Seen Users in CloudTrail
  - Update` hourly (or more frequently depending on how often you run the detection
  searches) to refresh the baselines.
known_false_positives: When a legitimate new user logins for the first time, this
  activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the user
  activity is legitimate.
