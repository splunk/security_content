description: This analytic detects anomalously changes in the ratio between specific process resources on a Kubernetes node, based on the past behavior for each process running in the Kubernetes scope on that node.
  This detection leverages process metrics harvested using an OTEL collector and hostmetrics receiver, and is pulled from Splunk Observability cloud using the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on. (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247).   
  This detection also leverages a lookup table that contains average and standard deviation for the cpu:disk operations, cpu:mem, cpu:thread count, disk operations:thread count, and mem:disk operations ratios.  
  This is used to indicate an anomalous change in resource ratios that indicate the workload has changed behavior irrespective of load.
  Changes in the relationship between utilization of different resources can indicate a change in behavior of the monitored process, which can indicate a potentially compromised application. 
  Deviations in resource ratios, such as memory-to-CPU or CPU-to-disk utilization, may signify compromised processes, malicious activity, or misconfigurations that could pose risks. 
  A change in process behavior could signify a potential security breach within the Kubernetes environment, where an attacker may have compromised a process either on the node or running within a container.

how_to_implement: 'To implement this detection, follow these steps: \
  
  * Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.\
  
  * Enable the hostmetrics/process receiver in the OTEL configuration.\
  
  * Ensure that the process metrics, specifically Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization, are enabled.\
  
  * Install the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on. (ref: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247)\
  
  * Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access Token.\
  
  * Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input "sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index".\
  
  * In the SIM configuration, set the Organization ID to your Observability Cloud Organization ID.\
  
  * Set the Signal Flow Program to the following: data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''A''); data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''B''); data(''process.cpu.time'').publish(label=''C''); data(''process.disk.io'').publish(label=''D''); data(''process.memory.usage'').publish(label=''E''); data(''process.memory.virtual'').publish(label=''F''); data(''process.memory.utilization'').publish(label=''G''); data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''H''); data(''process.disk.operations'').publish(label=''I''); data(''process.handles'').publish(label=''J''); data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''K'')\
  
  * Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.\
  
  * Leave all other settings at their default values.\
  
  * Run the Search Baseline Of Kubernetes Container Network IO Ratio '
