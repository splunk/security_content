author: Gowthamaraj Rajendran, Bhavin Patel, Splunk
type: TTP
datamodel:
- Authentication
description: It shows that there have been an unsuccessful attempt to log in using the user identity to the AWS management console. 
  Since the user identity has access to AWS account services and resources, an attacker might try to brute force the password for that identity.
search: '| tstats count earliest(_time) as firstTime, latest(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Authentication where Authentication.action = failure Authentication.app=AwsConsoleSignIn Authentication.signature=ConsoleLogin BY Authentication.app Authentication.signature Authentication.dest  Authentication.user Authentication.action Authentication.user_id Authentication.src | `drop_dm_object_name(Authentication)`  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_credential_access_failed_login_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: Users may genuinely mistype or forget the password.
