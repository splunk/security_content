description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user created a policy
  version that allows them to access any resource in their account
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=CreatePolicyVersion eventSource = iam.amazonaws.com
  errorCode = success | spath input=requestParameters.policyDocument output=key_policy_statements
  path=Statement{} | mvexpand key_policy_statements | spath input=key_policy_statements
  output=key_policy_action_1 path=Action | search key_policy_action_1 = "*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(key_policy_statements)
  as policy_added by eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode userAgent eventID
  awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|`aws_create_policy_version_to_allow_all_resources_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a policy to allow a user to access all
  resources. That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to all
  AWS resources
