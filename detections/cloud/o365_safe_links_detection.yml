description: The following analytic detects when any Microsoft Safe Links alerting is triggered. This behavior may indicate when user has interacted with a phishing or otherwise malicious link within the Microsoft Office ecosystem.
data_source:
- O365 Universal Audit Log
search: '`o365_management_activity` Name="*a potentially malicious URL*" Operation=AlertEntityGenerated | fromjson Data | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(ObjectId) as url values(od) as desc by AlertId,trc,Operation,Name,ot | rename Name as signature, AlertId as signature_id, trc as user,ot as action | eval action = CASE(action == "Allowed", "allowed", action=="BlockPageOverride", "allowed", true(),"blocked") | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `o365_safe_links_detection_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events. The Safe Links capability must be configured and is typically only available to E3/E5 level customers.
known_false_positives: Based on Safe Links policies, may vary.
