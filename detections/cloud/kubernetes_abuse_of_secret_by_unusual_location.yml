description: 'The following analytic detects unauthorized access or misuse of Kubernetes Secrets from unusual locations. 
  It identifies anomalies in access patterns by segmenting and analyzing the source of requests by country. 
  Kubernetes Secrets, which store sensitive information like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys, are critical assets, 
  and their misuse can lead to significant security breaches. This behavior is worth identifying for a SOC as it could indicate 
  an attacker attempting to exfiltrate or misuse these secrets. The impact of such an attack could be severe, 
  potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.
  Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
  Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server.
  Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
