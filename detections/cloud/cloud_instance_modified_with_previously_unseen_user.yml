description: This search looks for cloud instances being modified by users who have
  not previously modified them.
how_to_implement: This search has a dependency on other searches to create and update
  a baseline of users observed to be associated with this activity. The search "Previously
  Seen Cloud Instance Modifications By User - Update" should be enabled for this detection
  to properly work.
id: 7fb15084-b14e-405a-bd61-a6de15a40722
known_false_positives: It's possible that a new user will start to modify EC2 instances
  when they haven't before for any number of reasons. Verify with the user that is
  modifying instances that this is the intended behavior.
