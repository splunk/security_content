description: 'The following analytic identifies an authentication attempt event against
  an Azure AD tenant that fails during the Multi Factor Authentication challenge.
  Error Code 500121 represents a failed attempt to authenticate using a second factor.
  This behavior may represent an adversary trying to authenticate with compromised
  credentials for an account that has multi-factor authentication enabled. '

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Legitimate users may miss to reply the MFA challenge within
  the time window or deny it by mistake.
