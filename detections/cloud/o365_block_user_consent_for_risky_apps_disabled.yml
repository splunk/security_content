- O365 Update authorization policy.
description: The following analytic detects when the "risk-based step-up consent"
  security setting in Microsoft 365 is disabled. It monitors Azure Active Directory
  logs for the "Update authorization policy" operation, specifically changes to the
  "AllowUserConsentForRiskyApps" setting. This activity is significant because disabling
  this feature can expose the organization to OAuth phishing threats, allowing users
  to grant consent to malicious applications. If confirmed malicious, attackers could
  gain unauthorized access to user data and sensitive information, leading to data
  breaches and further compromise within the organization.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Legitimate changes to the 'risk-based step-up consent' setting
  by administrators, perhaps as part of a policy update or security assessment, may
  trigger this alert, necessitating verification of the change's intent and authorization.
