description: This detection is crafted to monitor and identify the creation of new email forwarding rules in an Office 365 environment. It specifically targets events logged under New-InboxRule and Set-InboxRule operations within o365_management_activity, indicating the establishment or modification of inbox rules that forward emails. The detection checks for the presence of parameters such as ForwardTo, ForwardAsAttachmentTo, and RedirectTo, which are key indicators of email forwarding behavior.
