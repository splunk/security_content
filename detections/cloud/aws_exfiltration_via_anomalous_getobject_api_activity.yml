status: production
type: Anomaly
data_source: 
- AWS CloudTrail GetObject
description: This search uses built in  Splunk command `| anomalydetection` to detect anomalies with respect to users making high number of GetObject API calls to download objects from S3 in a 10 minute time window. The field `probable_cause` is the name of the field that best explains why the event is anomalous. This command identifies anomalous events by computing a probability for each GetObject event by "count" "user_type" "user_arn" and detects anomaly based on the frequencies.  
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=GetObject | bin _time span=10m |  stats count values(requestParameters.bucketName) as bucketName by _time src_ip aws_account_id user_type user_arn userIdentity.principalId
  | anomalydetection "count" "user_type" "user_arn" action=annotate | search probable_cause=* |`aws_exfiltration_via_anomalous_getobject_api_activity_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that a user downloaded these files to use them locally and there are AWS services in configured that perform these activities for a legitimate reason. Filter is needed.
