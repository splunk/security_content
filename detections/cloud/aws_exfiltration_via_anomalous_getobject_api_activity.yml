name: AWS Exfiltration via Anomalous GetObject API Activity

status: production
type: Anomaly
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail GetObject
description: The following analytic identifies anomalous GetObject API activity in
  AWS, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  logs and uses the `anomalydetection` command to detect unusual patterns in the frequency
  of GetObject API calls by analyzing fields such as "count," "user_type," and "user_arn"
  within a 10-minute window. This activity is significant as it may indicate unauthorized
  data access or exfiltration from S3 buckets. If confirmed malicious, attackers could
  exfiltrate sensitive data, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=GetObject | bin _time span=10m |  stats count values(requestParameters.bucketName)
  as bucketName by _time src_ip aws_account_id user_type user_arn userIdentity.principalId
  | anomalydetection "count" "user_type" "user_arn" action=annotate | search probable_cause=*
  |`aws_exfiltration_via_anomalous_getobject_api_activity_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that a user downloaded these files to use them
  locally and there are AWS services in configured that perform these activities for
  a legitimate reason. Filter is needed.
