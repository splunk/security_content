description: The following analytic detects the creation of a Kubernetes cron job,
  which is a task scheduled to run automatically at specified intervals. It identifies
  this activity by monitoring Kubernetes Audit logs for the creation events of cron
  jobs. This behavior is significant for a SOC as it could allow an attacker to execute
  malicious tasks repeatedly and automatically, posing a threat to the Kubernetes
  infrastructure. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to persistent attacks,
  service disruptions, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.
  Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
  Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server.
  Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
