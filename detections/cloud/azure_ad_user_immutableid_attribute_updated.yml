description: The following analytic identifies the modification of the SourceAnchor
  (also called ImmutableId) attribute for an Azure Active Directory user. Updating
  this attribute is a step required to set up the Azure Active Directory identity
  federation backdoor technique discovered by security researcher Nestori Syynimaa.
  Similar to Active Directory, Azure AD uses the concept of domains to manage directories
  of identities. A new Azure AD tenant will initially contain a single domain that
  is commonly called the `cloud-only` onmicrosoft.com domain. Organizations can also
  add their registered custom domains to Azure AD for email addresses to match the
  organizations domain name. If the organization intends to use a third-party identity
  provider such as ADFS for authentication, the added custom domains can be configured
  as federated. An adversary who has obtained privileged access to an Azure AD tenant
  may leverage this technique to establish persistence and be able to authenticate
  to Azure AD impersonating any user and bypassing the requirement to have a valid
  password and/or perform MFA.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: The SourceAnchor (also called ImmutableId) Azure AD attribute
  has legitimate uses for directory synchronization. Investigate and filter as needed.
