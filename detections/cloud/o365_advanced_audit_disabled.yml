description: The following analytic detects instances where the O365 advanced audit
  is disabled for a specific user within the Office 365 tenant. It uses O365 audit
  logs, focusing on events related to audit license changes in AzureActiveDirectory
  workloads. This activity is significant because the O365 advanced audit provides
  critical logging and insights into user and administrator activities. Disabling
  it can blind security teams to potential malicious actions. If confirmed malicious,
  attackers could operate within the user's mailbox or account with reduced risk of
  detection, leading to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, or account compromise.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Administrators might temporarily disable the advanced audit
  for troubleshooting, performance reasons, or other administrative tasks. Filter
  as needed.
