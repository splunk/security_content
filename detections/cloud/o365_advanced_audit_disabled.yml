description: The following analytic detects instances where the O365 advanced audit is disabled for a specific user within the Office 365 tenant. It uses O365 audit logs, focusing on events related to audit license changes in AzureActiveDirectory workloads. This activity is significant because the O365 advanced audit provides critical logging and insights into user and administrator activities. Disabling it can blind security teams to potential malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, attackers could operate within the user's mailbox or account with reduced risk of detection, leading to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, or account compromise.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Administrators might temporarily disable the advanced audit for troubleshooting, performance reasons, or other administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
