name: Kubernetes AWS detect suspicious kubectl calls

status: experimental
type: Anomaly
description: 'The following analytic detects anonymous and unauthenticated requests
  to a Kubernetes cluster. It identifies this behavior by monitoring API calls from
  users who have not provided any token or password in their request, using data from
  `kube_audit` logs. This activity is significant for a SOC as it indicates a severe
  misconfiguration, allowing unfettered access to the cluster with no traceability.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain access to sensitive data or control
  over the cluster, posing a substantial security risk.'
data_source:
- Kubernetes Audit
search: '`kube_audit` user.username="system:anonymous" user.groups{} IN ("system:unauthenticated")
  | fillnull | stats count by objectRef.name objectRef.namespace objectRef.resource
  requestReceivedTimestamp requestURI responseStatus.code sourceIPs{} stage user.groups{}
  user.uid user.username userAgent verb | rename sourceIPs{} as src_ip, user.username
  as user |`kubernetes_aws_detect_suspicious_kubectl_calls_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudwatch logs.
known_false_positives: Kubectl calls are not malicious by nature. However source IP,
  verb and Object can reveal potential malicious activity, specially anonymous suspicious
  IPs and sensitive objects such as configmaps or secrets
