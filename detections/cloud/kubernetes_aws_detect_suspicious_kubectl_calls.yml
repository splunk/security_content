description: 'The following analytic detects anonymous and unauthenticated requests to a Kubernetes cluster. 
  It identifies this behavior by monitoring for API calls from users who have not provided any token or password in their request. 
  This is a significant behavior to identify for a SOC as it indicates a severe misconfiguration that allows unfettered access to a cluster 
  with no traceability to a user or service. The impact of such an attack could be substantial, 
  potentially granting an attacker access to sensitive data or control over the cluster. 
  This detection rule is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your Kubernetes infrastructure.'
data_source: 
- Kubernetes Audit
search: '`kube_audit` user.username="system:anonymous" user.groups{} IN ("system:unauthenticated")
  | fillnull
  | stats count by objectRef.name objectRef.namespace objectRef.resource requestReceivedTimestamp requestURI 
  responseStatus.code sourceIPs{} stage user.groups{} user.uid user.username userAgent verb
  | rename sourceIPs{} as src_ip, user.username as user
  |`kubernetes_aws_detect_suspicious_kubectl_calls_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudwatch logs.
known_false_positives: Kubectl calls are not malicious by nature. However source IP,
  verb and Object can reveal potential malicious activity, specially anonymous suspicious
  IPs and sensitive objects such as configmaps or secrets
