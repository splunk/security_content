description: "The following analytic detects potential privilege escalation threats in Azure Active Directory (AD). The detection is made by running a specific search within the ingested Azure Active Directory events to leverage the AuditLogs log category. This detection is important because it identifies instances where privileged roles that hold elevated permissions are assigned to service principals. This prevents unauthorized access or malicious activities, which occur when these non-human entities access Azure resources to exploit them. False positives might occur since administrators can legitimately assign privileged roles to service principals."

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the privileged roles
  to Service Principals as part of administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
