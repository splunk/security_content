description: "The following analytic detects the assignment of privileged roles to
  service principals in Azure Active Directory (AD). It leverages the AuditLogs log
  category from ingested Azure AD events. This activity is significant because assigning
  elevated permissions to non-human entities can lead to unauthorized access or malicious
  activities. If confirmed malicious, attackers could exploit these service principals
  to gain elevated access to Azure resources, potentially compromising sensitive data
  and critical infrastructure. Monitoring this behavior helps prevent privilege escalation
  and ensures the security of Azure environments."

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the privileged roles
  to Service Principals as part of administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
