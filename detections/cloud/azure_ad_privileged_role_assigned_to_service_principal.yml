description: The following analytic is geared towards detecting potential privilege escalation threats in Azure Active Directory (AD). It identifies instances where privileged roles, which hold elevated permissions, are assigned to Service Principals. These non-human entities that can access Azure resources could be exploited in an attack scenario, leading to unauthorized access or malicious activities. The analytic runs a specific search within the ingested Azure AD events, specifically leveraging the AuditLogs log category. Keep in mind, however, that there could be false positives, as administrators may legitimately assign privileged roles to Service Principals.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the privileged roles
  to Service Principals as part of administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
