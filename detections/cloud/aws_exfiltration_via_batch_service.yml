description: The following analytic identifies the creation of AWS Batch jobs that
  could potentially abuse the AWS Bucket Replication feature on S3 buckets. It leverages
  AWS CloudTrail logs to detect the `JobCreated` event, analyzing job details and
  their status. This activity is significant because attackers can exploit this feature
  to exfiltrate data by creating malicious batch jobs. If confirmed malicious, this
  could lead to unauthorized data transfer between S3 buckets, resulting in data breaches
  and loss of sensitive information.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = JobCreated |  stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(serviceEventDetails.jobArn) as job_arn values(serviceEventDetails.status)
  as status by src_ip  aws_account_id eventName errorCode userAgent 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `aws_exfiltration_via_batch_service_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS Administrator or a user has legitimately
  created this job for some tasks.
