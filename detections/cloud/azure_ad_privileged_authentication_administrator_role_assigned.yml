- Azure Active Directory Add member to role
description: The following analytic detects the assignment of the Privileged Authentication
  Administrator role to an Azure AD user. It leverages Azure Active Directory audit
  logs to identify when this specific role is assigned. This activity is significant
  because users in this role can set or reset authentication methods for any user,
  including those in privileged roles like Global Administrators. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could change credentials and assume the identity and permissions of
  high-privilege users, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information
  and critical configurations.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging
  the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the Privileged Authentication
  Administrator role as part of administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
