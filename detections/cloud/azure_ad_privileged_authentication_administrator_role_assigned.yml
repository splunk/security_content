description: The following analytic identifies the assignment of the Privileged Authentication Administrato role to an Azure AD user. Users in this role can set or reset authentication
  methods for any user in Azure Active Directory, including privileged roles like Global Administrators. Users with this role can change credentials for people who may have access to sensitive
  or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Azure Active Directory. Changing the credentials of a user may mean the ability to assume that users identity and permissions.
  Red teams and adversaries alike may abuse this role to escalate their privileges.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately assign the Privileged Authentication Administrator role
  as part of administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
