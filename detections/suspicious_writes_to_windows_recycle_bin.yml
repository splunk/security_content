description: This search detects writes to the recycle bin by a process other than
  explorer.exe.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on filesystem and process logs responsible for the changes from your endpoints into
  the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem` nodes.

known_false_positives: Because the Recycle Bin is a hidden folder in modern versions
  of Windows, it would be unusual for a process other than explorer.exe to write to
  it. Incidents should be investigated as appropriate.
