description: The search looks for modifications to registry keys that can be used
  to launch an application or service at system startup.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  products, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.

known_false_positives: There are many legitimate applications that must execute on
  system startup and will use these registry keys to accomplish that task.
