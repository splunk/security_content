description: The following analytic detects email files (.pst or .ost) being created
  outside the standard Outlook directories. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem data
  model to identify file creation events and filters for email files not located in
  "C:\Users\*\My Documents\Outlook Files\*" or "C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook*".
  This activity is significant as it may indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized
  access to email data. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could potentially access
  sensitive email content, leading to data breaches or further exploitation within
  the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Filesystem.file_path)
  as file_path min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where (Filesystem.file_name=*.pst OR Filesystem.file_name=*.ost) Filesystem.file_path
  != "C:\\Users\\*\\My Documents\\Outlook Files\\*"  Filesystem.file_path!="C:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook*"
  by Filesystem.action Filesystem.process_id Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.dest

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records the file-system activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint.Filesystem
  data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black, or by other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report file-system
  reads and writes.
known_false_positives: Administrators and users sometimes prefer backing up their
  email data by moving the email files into a different folder. These attempts will
  be detected by the search.
