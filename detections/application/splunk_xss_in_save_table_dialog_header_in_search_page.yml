description: This is a hunting search to find persistent cross-site scripting XSS
  code that was included while inputing data in 'Save Table' dialog in Splunk Enterprise
  (8.1.12,8.2.9,9.0.2). A remote user with "power" Splunk role can store this code
  that can lead to persistent cross site scripting.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd_webx` method=POST  uri=/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/datamodel/model
  | table _time host status clientip user uri | `splunk_xss_in_save_table_dialog_header_in_search_page_filter`'
how_to_implement: Watch for POST requests combined with XSS script strings or obfuscation
  against the injection point /en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/datamodel/model.
known_false_positives: If host is vulnerable and XSS script strings are inputted they
  will show up in search. Not all Post requests are malicious as they will show when
  users create and save dashboards. This search may produce several results with non
  malicious POST requests. Only affects Splunk Web enabled instances.
