how_to_implement: This detection utilizes logs from Okta Identity Management (IM) environments. It requires the ingestion of OktaIm2 logs through the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553). Additionally, it necessitates the activation of suspicious activity reporting and training for associates to report such activities.
known_false_positives: False positives should be minimal, given the high fidelity of this detection.
