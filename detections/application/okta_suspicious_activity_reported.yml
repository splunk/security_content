description: The following analytic identifies when an associate reports a login attempt as suspicious via an email from Okta. It leverages Okta Identity Management logs, specifically the `user.account.report_suspicious_activity_by_enduser` event type. This activity is significant as it indicates potential unauthorized access attempts, warranting immediate investigation to prevent possible security breaches. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data, leading to data theft, privilege escalation, or further compromise of the environment.

how_to_implement: This detection utilizes logs from Okta Identity Management (IM) environments. It requires the ingestion of OktaIm2 logs through the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553). Additionally, it necessitates the activation of suspicious activity reporting and training for associates to report such activities.
known_false_positives: False positives should be minimal, given the high fidelity of this detection. marker.
