description: This analytic detects instances where a user adds themselves to an Active Directory (AD) group. This activity
  is a common indicator of privilege escalation, where a user attempts to gain unauthorized access to higher
  privileges or sensitive resources. By monitoring AD logs, this detection identifies such suspicious behavior,
  which could be part of a larger attack strategy aimed at compromising critical systems and data.
