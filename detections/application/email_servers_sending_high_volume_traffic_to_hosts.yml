description: The following analytic identifies a significant increase in data transfers from your email server to client hosts. It leverages the Network_Traffic data model to monitor outbound traffic from email servers, using statistical analysis to detect anomalies based on average and standard deviation metrics. This activity is significant as it may indicate a malicious actor exfiltrating data via your email server. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized data access and potential data breaches, compromising sensitive information and impacting organizational security.

how_to_implement: This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.  Your email servers must be categorized as "email_server" for the search to work, as well. You may need to adjust the deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples values based on the network traffic in your environment. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.
known_false_positives: The false-positive rate will vary based on how you set the deviation_threshold and data_samples values. Our recommendation is to adjust these values based on your network traffic to and from your email servers.
