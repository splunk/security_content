status: production
type: Hunting
description: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, a View
  allows for Cross-Site Scripting in an XML View through the 'layoutPanel' attribute
  in the 'module' tag. The vulnerability affects instances with Splunk Web enabled.
  This hunting search shows users action, application and role used for creating views
  related to this vulnerability.
data_source: []
search: 'index = _internal sourcetype IN ("splunk_web_service", "splunk_python") message="*loadParams*"
  | `security_content_ctime(_time)` |  table _time message fileName | `splunk_xss_via_view_filter`'
how_to_implement: This data is collected by default in Splunk.  Upon first enabling
  this rule, a number of errors may be observed. Those that are due to improperly
  formatted, but non-nefarious, XML views should be be remedied in the corresponding
  view. Please take care investigating potential XSS as accessing an affected page
  could retrigger the exploit.
known_false_positives: The error detected above can be generated for a wide variety
  of improperly formatted XML views.  There will be false positives as the search
  cannot extract the malicious payload and the view should be manually investigated.
