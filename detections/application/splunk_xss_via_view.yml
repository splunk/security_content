name: Splunk XSS via View
id: 9ac2bfea-a234-4a18-9d37-6d747e85c2e4
version: 1
date: "2023-02-07"
author: Rod Soto, Eric McGinnis, Splunk
type: Hunting
datamodel: []
description: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, a View allows for Cross-Site Scripting in an XML View through the 'layoutPanel' attribute in the 'module' tag. The vulnerability affects instances with Splunk Web enabled. This hunting search shows users action, application and role used for creating views related to this vulnerability.
search: index = _internal sourcetype IN ("splunk_web_service", "splunk_python") message="*loadParams*" | `security_content_ctime(_time)` |  table _time message fileName | `splunk_xss_via_view_filter`
how_to_implement: This data is collected by default in Splunk.  Upon first enabling this rule, a number of errors may be observed. Those that are due to improperly formatted, but non-nefarious, XML views should be be remedied in the corresponding view. Please take care investigating potential XSS as accessing an affected page could retrigger the exploit.
known_false_positives: The error detected above can be generated for a wide variety of improperly formatted XML views.  There will be false positives as the search cannot extract the malicious payload and the view should be manually investigated.
