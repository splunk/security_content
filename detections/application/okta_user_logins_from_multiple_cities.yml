known_false_positives: Users in your enviornment may legitmately be travelling and
  loggin in from different locations. This search is useful for those users that should
  *not* be travelling for some reason, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The search also
  relies on the geographical information being populated in the Okta logs. It is also
  possible that a connection from another region may be attributed to a login from
  a remote VPN endpoint.
