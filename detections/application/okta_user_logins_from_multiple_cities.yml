description: This search detects logins from the same user from different cities in
  a 24 hour period.
data_source: []
search: '`okta` displayMessage="User login to Okta" client.geographicalContext.city!=null
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime dc(client.geographicalContext.city)
  as locations values(client.geographicalContext.city) as cities values(client.geographicalContext.state)
  as states by user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `okta_user_logins_from_multiple_cities_filter` | search locations > 1'
how_to_implement: This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being
  ingested in your Splunk deployment.
known_false_positives: Users in your environment may legitimately be travelling and
  logging in from different locations. This search is useful for those users that should
  *not* be travelling for some reason, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The search also
  relies on the geographical information being populated in the Okta logs. It is also
  possible that a connection from another region may be attributed to a login from
  a remote VPN endpoint.
