description: The following analytic identifies instances where the same Okta user
  logs in from different cities within a 24-hour period. This detection leverages
  Okta Identity Management logs, analyzing login events and their geographic locations.
  Such behavior is significant as it may indicate a compromised account, with an attacker
  attempting unauthorized access from multiple locations. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could lead to account takeovers and data breaches, allowing attackers
  to access sensitive information and potentially escalate their privileges within
  the environment.

how_to_implement: This detection utilizes logs from Okta Identity Management (IM)
  environments. It requires the ingestion of OktaIm2 logs through the Splunk Add-on
  for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: It is uncommon for a user to log in from multiple cities simultaneously,
  which may indicate a false positive.
