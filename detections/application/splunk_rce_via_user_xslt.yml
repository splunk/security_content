description: The following analytic identifies potential remote code execution (RCE)
  attempts via user-supplied Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT)
  in Splunk versions 9.1.x. It detects this activity by analyzing `splunkd_ui` logs
  for specific URI patterns and status codes indicative of XSLT injection attempts.
  This activity is significant because successful exploitation could allow an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code on the Splunk server. If confirmed malicious, this could
  lead to full system compromise, unauthorized data access, and further lateral movement
  within the network.
search: '`splunkd_ui` ((uri="*NO_BINARY_CHECK=1*" AND "*input.path=*.xsl*") OR uri="*dispatch*.xsl*")
  AND uri!= "*splunkd_ui*" | rex field=uri "(?<string>=\s*([\S\s]+))" | eval decoded_field=urldecode(string)
  | eval action=case(match(status,"200"),"Allowed",match(status,"303|500|401|403|404|301|406"),"Blocked",1=1,"Unknown")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by clientip useragent
  uri decoded_field action host | rename clientip as src, uri as dest_uri | iplocation
  src | fillnull value="N/A" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | table firstTime, lastTime src, useragent, action, count, Country, Region, City,
  dest_uri, decoded_field'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _internal index.
known_false_positives: This search will provide information for investigation and
  hunting possible abuse of user-supplied XSLT. There may be false positives and results
  should individually evaluated. Please evaluate the source IP and useragent responsible
  for creating the requests.
