status: experimental
type: Anomaly
description: The following anomaly will generate based on account lockout events utilizing
  Okta eventTypes of user.account.lock.limit or user.account.lock. Per the Okta docs
  site, this event is fired when a user account has reached the lockout limit. The
  account will not auto-unlock and a user or client cannot gain access to the account.
  This event indicates an account that will not be able to log in until remedial action
  is taken by the account admin. This event can be used to understand the specifics
  of an account lockout. Often this indicates a client application that is repeatedly
  attempting to authenticate with invalid credentials such as an old password.
data_source: []
search: '`okta` eventType IN (user.account.lock.limit,user.account.lock) | rename
  client.geographicalContext.country as country, client.geographicalContext.state
  as state, client.geographicalContext.city as city | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(src_user) by displayMessage, country, state, city,
  src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `okta_account_lockout_events_filter`'
how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested.
known_false_positives: None. Account lockouts should be followed up on to determine
  if the actual user was the one who caused the lockout, or if it was an unauthorized
  actor.
