id: 25625cb4-1c4d-4463-b0f9-7cb462699cde
version: 2
date: '2024-03-19'
author: Lou Stella, Splunk
status: production
type: TTP
description: On May 3rd, 2022, Splunk published a security advisory for  username
  enumeration stemming from verbose login failure messages present on some REST endpoints.
  This detection will alert on attempted exploitation in patched versions of Splunk
  as well as actual exploitation in unpatched version of Splunk.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: ' `splunkd_failed_auths` | stats count(user) as auths by user, src | where
  auths>5 | stats values(user) as user, sum(auths) as TotalFailedAuths by src |
  `splunk_user_enumeration_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _audit index. This detection may
  assist in efforts to find password spraying or brute force authorization attempts
  in addition to someone enumerating usernames.
known_false_positives: Automation executing authentication attempts against your Splunk
  infrastructure with outdated credentials may cause false positives.
