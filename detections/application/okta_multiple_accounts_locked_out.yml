description: The following analytic utilizes the user.acount.lock event to identify multiple Okta accounts locking out in a short period of time. An adversary attempting to brute force or password spray account names may lock accounts out depending on the threshold set by the organization. Monitoring for multiple account lockouts can help detect potential account takeover attempts or unauthorized access to Okta accounts.

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: Multiple account lockouts may be also triggered by an application malfunction. Filter as needed, and monitor for any unusual activity.
