description: The following analytic detects multiple Okta accounts being locked out
  within a short period. It uses the user.account.lock event from Okta logs, aggregated
  over a 5-minute window, to identify this behavior. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate a brute force or password spraying attack, where an adversary
  attempts to guess passwords, leading to account lockouts. If confirmed malicious,
  this could result in potential account takeovers or unauthorized access to sensitive
  Okta accounts, posing a significant security risk.

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the
  Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: Multiple account lockouts may be also triggered by an application
  malfunction. Filter as needed, and monitor for any unusual activity.
