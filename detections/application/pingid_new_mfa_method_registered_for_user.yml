description: The following analytic detects the registration of a new Multi-Factor
  Authentication (MFA) method for a PingID (PingOne) account. It leverages JSON logs
  from PingID, specifically looking for successful device pairing events. This activity
  is significant as adversaries who gain unauthorized access to a user account may
  register a new MFA method to maintain persistence. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow attackers to bypass existing security measures, maintain long-term access,
  and potentially escalate their privileges within the compromised environment.
data_source:
- PingID
search: >-
  `pingid` "result.message"="Device Paired*" result.status="SUCCESS"   | rex field=result.message
  "Device (Unp)?(P)?aired (?<device_extract>.+)"
  | eval src = coalesce('resources{}.ipaddress','resources{}.devicemodel'), user =
  upper('actors{}.name'), reason = 'result.message'
  | eval object=CASE(ISNOTNULL('resources{}.devicemodel'),'resources{}.devicemodel',true(),device_extract)
  | eval action=CASE(match('result.message',"Device Paired*"),"created",match('result.message',
  "Device Unpaired*"),"deleted")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime by src,user,object,action,reason
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `pingid_new_mfa_method_registered_for_user_filter`
how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest JSON logging from a PingID(PingOne)
  enterprise environment, either via Webhook or Push Subscription.
known_false_positives: False positives may be generated by normal provisioning workflows
  for user device registration.
