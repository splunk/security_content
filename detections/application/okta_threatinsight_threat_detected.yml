author: Michael Haag, Mauricio Velazco, Splunk
status: production
type: Anomaly
description: This anomaly is based on the identification of threats by Okta ThreatInsight. It allows for the escalation of risk based on src_ip or the addition of fields for further tracking. Possible identifications include password spraying, login failures, and login failures with a high count of unknown users.

how_to_implement: This detection utilizes logs from Okta Identity Management (IM) environments. It requires the ingestion of OktaIm2 logs through the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: False positives may occur. It is recommended to fine-tune Okta settings and the analytic to ensure high fidelity. Adjust the risk score as necessary.
