description: The following analytic identifies threats detected by Okta ThreatInsight, such as password spraying, login failures, and high counts of unknown user login attempts. It leverages Okta Identity Management logs, specifically focusing on security.threat.detected events. This activity is significant for a SOC as it highlights potential unauthorized access attempts and credential-based attacks. If confirmed malicious, these activities could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and further exploitation of compromised accounts, posing a significant risk to the organization's security posture.

search: '`okta` eventType = security.threat.detected | rename client.geographicalContext.country as country, client.geographicalContext.state as state, client.geographicalContext.city as city | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by app src_ip signature eventType displayMessage client.device city state country user_agent outcome.reason outcome.result severity | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `okta_threatinsight_threat_detected_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection utilizes logs from Okta Identity Management (IM) environments. It requires the ingestion of OktaIm2 logs through the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: False positives may occur. It is recommended to fine-tune Okta settings and the analytic to ensure high fidelity. Adjust the risk score as necessary.
