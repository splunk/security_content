description: The following analytic identifies an account that has rejected more than
  2 Push notifications in a 10 minute window. Modify this query for your environment
  by upping the count or time window.
data_source: []
search: '`okta` outcome.reason="User rejected Okta push verify" OR (debugContext.debugData.factor="OKTA_VERIFY_PUSH"
  outcome.result=FAILURE legacyEventType="core.user.factor.attempt_fail" "target{}.detailEntry.methodTypeUsed"="Get
  a push notification") | bin _time as bin_time span=10m | eval user=coalesce(actor.alternateId,user),
  user=mvindex(split(user, "@"), 0), event_time = _time | stats earliest(event_time)
  as event_time, min(_time) as firsttime max(_time) as lasttime values(client.ipAddress)
  as client.ipAddress, values(outcome.reason) as outcome, values(src_ip) AS src_ip,
  values(client.userAgent.rawUserAgent) as user_agent, values(eventType) as eventType,
  values(outcome.result) as action, values(legacyEventType) as legacyEventType values(index)
  as idx, values(sourcetype) as st count by bin_time user host | rename bin_time as
  timeWindow | convert ctime(*timeWindow) ctime(firsttime) ctime(lasttime) | where
  count >= 2 | `okta_two_or_more_rejected_okta_pushes_filter`'
how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune Okta and tune the analytic
  to ensure proper fidelity. Modify risk score as needed. Drop to anomaly until tuning
  is complete.
