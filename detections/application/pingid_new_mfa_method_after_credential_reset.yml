description: A common social engineering technique used by threat actors is the impersonation of a valid user to organizational support staff for a password reset. During the same support call or quickly afterwards the threat actor will request provisioning of a new MFA device. This does not require malware or phishing infrastructure and has proven to be successful in numerous historical attacks. This detection looks for the pattern of password reset, followed by MFA device provisioning.

how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest Windows Event Log and PingID(PingOne) data sources. Specifically from logs from Active Directory Domain Controllers and JSON logging from a PingID(PingOne) enterprise environment, either via Webhook or Push Subscription.
known_false_positives: False positives may be generated by normal provisioning workflows that generate a password reset followed by a device registration.
