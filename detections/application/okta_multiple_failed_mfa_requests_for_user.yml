description: The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) requests for a single user within an Okta tenant. It triggers when more than
  10 MFA attempts fail within 5 minutes, using Okta event logs to detect this pattern.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to bypass
  MFA by bombarding the user with repeated authentication requests, a technique used
  by threat actors like Lapsus and APT29. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
  to unauthorized access, potentially compromising sensitive information and systems.

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the
  Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication
  or application issues. Filter as needed and monitor for any unusual activity.
