status: production
type: Hunting
description: Splunk versions below 8.1.12,8.2.9 and 9.0.2 are vulnerable to reflected
  cross site scripting (XSS). A View allows for a Reflected Cross Site scripting via
  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) in a query parameter when ouput_mode=radio.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd_webx` user=admin status=200 uri=*/lists/entities/x/ui/views* uri_query!=null
  | stats count earliest(_time) as event_time values(status) as status values(clientip)
  as clientip by index, sourcetype, _time, host, user, uri | `splunk_reflected_xss_in_the_templates_lists_radio_filter`'
how_to_implement: This vulnerability only affects instances with Splunk Web enabled.
  This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require
  the ability to search the _internal index.
known_false_positives: This search may produce false positives as it is difficult
  to pinpoint all possible XSS injection characters in a single search string. Special
  attention is required to "en-US/list/entities/x/ui/views" which is the vulnerable
  injection point.
