description: This search detects Okta login failures due to bad credentials for multiple
  users originating from the same ip address.
search: '`okta` outcome.reason=INVALID_CREDENTIALS | rename client.geographicalContext.country
  as country, client.geographicalContext.state as state, client.geographicalContext.city
  as city | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime dc(user) as distinct_users
  values(user) as users by src_ip, displayMessage, outcome.reason, country, state,
  city  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |  search distinct_users > 5| `multiple_okta_users_with_invalid_credentails_from_the_same_ip_filter` '
how_to_implement: This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being
  ingested in your Splunk deployment.
known_false_positives: A single public IP address servicing multiple legitmate users
  may trigger this search. In addition, the threshold of 5 distinct users may be too
  low for your needs. You may modify the included filter macro `multiple_okta_users_with_invalid_credentails_from_the_same_ip_filter` to raise
  the threshold or except specific IP adresses from triggering this search.
