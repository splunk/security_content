known_false_positives: A single public IP address servicing multiple legitmate users
  may trigger this search. In addition, the threshold of 5 distinct users may be too
  low for your needs. You may modify the included filter macro XXXXXXXXXXXXX to raise
  the threshold or except specific IP adresses from triggering this search.
