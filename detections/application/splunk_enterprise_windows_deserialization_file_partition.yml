status: production
type: TTP
data_source:
- Splunk
description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit a deserialization
  vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise for Windows versions below 9.0.8 and 9.1.3. It
  detects irregular path file executions by analyzing `splunk_python` logs and extracting
  file paths and names. This activity is significant because it indicates potential
  exploitation of a known vulnerability, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary
  code, and potentially compromise the entire Splunk environment, leading to data
  breaches and further system exploitation.
search: '`splunk_python` request_path="/*/app/search/C:\\Program" *strings* |
  rex "request_path=(?<file_path>[^\"]+)" | rex field=file_path "[^\"]+/(?<file_name>[^\"\''\s/\\\\]+)"
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(file_path) as file_path
  values(file_name) as file_name by index, sourcetype, host | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `splunk_enterprise_windows_deserialization_file_partition_filter`'
how_to_implement: Requires access to internal indexes. This detection search will
  display irregular path file execution, which will display exploit attempts. Only
  applies to Microsoft Windows Splunk versions.
known_false_positives: Irregular path with files that may be purposely called for
  benign reasons may produce false positives.
