description: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, the lookup table uploads let a user upload lookup tables with unnecessary filename extensions. Lookup table file extensions may now only be one of .csv, .csv.gz, .kmz, .kml, .mmdb, or .mmdb.gz. This search provides user activity focus on uploads which aims to help hunt for malicious file uploads.
search:
  '`splunkda` method IN ("POST", "DELETE") uri_path=/servicesNS/*/ui/views/*
  | eval activity = case( method=="POST" AND like( uri_path , "%/acl" ) , "Permissions Update", method=="POST" AND NOT like( uri_path , "%/acl" ) , "Edited" , method=="DELETE" , "Deleted" )
  | rex field=uri_path "(?<user_and_app>.*?)\/ui\/views/(?<dashboard_encoded>.*)"
  | eval dashboard = urldecode( dashboard_encoded )
  | table _time, uri_path, user, dashboard, activity, uri_path
  | `splunk_unnecessary_file_extensions_allowed_by_lookup_table_uploads_filter`'
how_to_implement: Requires access to internal splunkd_access.
known_false_positives: This is a hunting search, the search provides information on upload, edit, and delete activity on Lookup Tables. Manual investigation is necessary after executing search. This search will produce false positives as payload cannot be directly discerned.
