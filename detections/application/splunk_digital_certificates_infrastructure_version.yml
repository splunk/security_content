description: The following analytic identifies improper TLS validation configuration
  on Splunk search heads and peers post version 9. It leverages REST API calls to
  retrieve server information and SSL configuration settings, checking fields like
  `sslVerifyServerCert` and `sslVerifyServerName`. This activity is significant for
  a SOC as improper TLS settings can expose the infrastructure to man-in-the-middle
  attacks and data breaches. If confirmed malicious, attackers could intercept or
  manipulate data, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of communications
  within the Splunk environment.

search: '| rest /services/server/info | table splunk_server version server_roles |
  join splunk_server [| rest /servicesNS/nobody/search/configs/conf-server/ search="sslConfig"|
  table splunk_server sslVerifyServerCert sslVerifyServerName serverCert] | fillnull
  value="Not Set" | rename sslVerifyServerCert as "Server.conf:SslConfig:sslVerifyServerCert",
  sslVerifyServerName as "Server.conf:SslConfig:sslVerifyServerName", serverCert as
  "Server.conf:SslConfig:serverCert" | `splunk_digital_certificates_infrastructure_version_filter`'
how_to_implement: The user running this search is required to have a permission allowing
  them to dispatch REST requests to indexers (the `dispatch_rest_to_indexers` capability)
  in some architectures. Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook that walks
  an analyst through the process of running these hunting searches in the references
  list of this detection. In order to use this workbook, a user will need to run a
  curl command to post the file to their SOAR instance such as "curl -u username:password
  https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template -d @splunk_psa_0622.json".
  A user should then create an empty container or case, attach the workbook, and begin
  working through the tasks.
known_false_positives: No known at this time.
