type: Hunting
description: This search will check the TLS validation is properly configured on the
  search head it is run from as well as its search peers after Splunk version 9. Other
  components such as additional search heads or anything this rest command cannot
  be distributed to will need to be manually checked.

search: '| rest /services/server/info | table splunk_server version server_roles |
  join splunk_server [| rest /servicesNS/nobody/search/configs/conf-server/ search="sslConfig"|
  table splunk_server sslVerifyServerCert sslVerifyServerName serverCert] | fillnull
  value="Not Set" | rename sslVerifyServerCert as "Server.conf:SslConfig:sslVerifyServerCert",
  sslVerifyServerName as "Server.conf:SslConfig:sslVerifyServerName", serverCert as
  "Server.conf:SslConfig:serverCert" | `splunk_digital_certificates_infrastructure_version_filter`'
how_to_implement: The user running this search is required to have a permission allowing
  them to dispatch REST requests to indexers (the `dispatch_rest_to_indexers` capability)
  in some architectures. Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook that walks
  an analyst through the process of running these hunting searches in the references
  list of this detection. In order to use this workbook, a user will need to run a
  curl command to post the file to their SOAR instance such as "curl -u username:password
  https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template -d @splunk_psa_0622.json".
  A user should then create an empty container or case, attach the workbook, and begin
  working through the tasks.
known_false_positives: No known at this time.
