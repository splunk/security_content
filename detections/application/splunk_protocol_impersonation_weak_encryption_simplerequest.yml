description: On June 14th 2022, Splunk released vulnerability advisory addresing Python TLS validation which was not set before Splunk version 9. From version 9 on Python3 client libraries now verify server certificates by default and use CA certificate store.This search warns about failure to validate certification using python3 request.
how_to_implement: Must upgrade to Splunk version 9 and Configure TLS host name validation for Splunk Python modules in order to apply this search.
known_false_positives: This search tries to address validation of server and client certificates within Splunk infrastructure, it might produce results from accidental or unintended requests to port 8089.
