description: On Splunk version 9 on Python3 client libraries verify server certificates
  by default and use CA certificate store. This search warns a user about a failure
  to validate a certificate using python3 request.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '`splunk_python` "simpleRequest SSL certificate validation is enabled without
  hostname verification" | stats count by host path | `splunk_protocol_impersonation_weak_encryption_simplerequest_filter`'
how_to_implement: Must upgrade to Splunk version 9 and Configure TLS host name validation
  for Splunk Python modules in order to apply this search. Splunk SOAR customers can
  find a SOAR workbook that walks an analyst through the process of running these
  hunting searches in the references list of this detection. In order to use this
  workbook, a user will need to run a curl command to post the file to their SOAR
  instance such as "curl -u username:password https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template
  -d @splunk_psa_0622.json". A user should then create an empty container or case,
  attach the workbook, and begin working through the tasks.
known_false_positives: This search tries to address validation of server and client
  certificates within Splunk infrastructure, it might produce results from accidental
  or unintended requests to port 8089.
