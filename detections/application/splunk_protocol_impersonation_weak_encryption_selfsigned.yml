description: On June 14th 2022, Splunk released vulnerability advisory addresing Python
  TLS validation which was not set before Splunk version 9. This search displays events
  showing WARNING of using Splunk issued default selfsigned certificates.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd` certificate event_message="X509 certificate* should not be used*"
  | stats count by host CN component log_level | `splunk_protocol_impersonation_weak_encryption_selfsigned_filter`'
how_to_implement: Must upgrade to Splunk version 9 and Configure TLS in order to apply
  this search. Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook that walks an analyst
  through the process of running these hunting searches in the references list of
  this detection. In order to use this workbook, a user will need to run a curl command
  to post the file to their SOAR instance such as "curl -u username:password https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template
  -d @splunk_psa_0622.json". A user should then create an empty container or case,
  attach the workbook, and begin working through the tasks.
known_false_positives: This searches finds self signed certificates issued by Splunk
  which are not recommended from Splunk version 9 forward.
