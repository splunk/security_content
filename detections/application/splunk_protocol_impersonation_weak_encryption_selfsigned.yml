description: The following analytic identifies the use of Splunk's default self-signed
  certificates, which are flagged as insecure. It detects events from the `splunkd`
  log where the event message indicates that an X509 certificate should not be used.
  This activity is significant because using weak encryption and self-signed certificates
  can expose the system to man-in-the-middle attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
  If confirmed malicious, attackers could impersonate Splunk services, intercept sensitive
  data, and compromise the integrity of the Splunk environment.

how_to_implement: Must upgrade to Splunk version 9 and Configure TLS in order to apply
  this search. Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook that walks an analyst
  through the process of running these hunting searches in the references list of
  this detection. In order to use this workbook, a user will need to run a curl command
  to post the file to their SOAR instance such as "curl -u username:password https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template
  -d @splunk_psa_0622.json". A user should then create an empty container or case,
  attach the workbook, and begin working through the tasks.
known_false_positives: This searches finds self signed certificates issued by Splunk
  which are not recommended from Splunk version 9 forward.
