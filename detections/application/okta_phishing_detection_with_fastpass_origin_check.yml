- Okta
description: The following analytic identifies failed user authentication attempts
  in Okta due to FastPass declining a phishing attempt. It leverages Okta logs, specifically
  looking for events where multi-factor authentication (MFA) fails with the reason
  "FastPass declined phishing attempt." This activity is significant as it indicates
  that attackers are targeting users with real-time phishing proxies, attempting to
  capture credentials. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access
  to user accounts, potentially compromising sensitive information and furthering
  lateral movement within the organization.
search: '`okta` eventType="user.authentication.auth_via_mfa" AND result="FAILURE"
  AND outcome.reason="FastPass declined phishing attempt" | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(displayMessage) by user eventType client.userAgent.rawUserAgent
  client.userAgent.browser outcome.reason | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `okta_phishing_detection_with_fastpass_origin_check_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested
  in your Splunk deployment.
known_false_positives: Fidelity of this is high as Okta is specifying malicious infrastructure.
  Filter and modify as needed.
