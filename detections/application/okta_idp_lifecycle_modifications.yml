description: The following analytic identifies modifications to Okta Identity Provider
  (IDP) lifecycle events, including creation, activation, deactivation, and deletion
  of IDP configurations. It uses OktaIm2 logs ingested via the Splunk Add-on for Okta
  Identity Cloud. Monitoring these events is crucial for maintaining the integrity
  and security of authentication mechanisms. Unauthorized or anomalous changes could
  indicate potential security breaches or misconfigurations. If confirmed malicious,
  attackers could manipulate authentication processes, potentially gaining unauthorized
  access or disrupting identity management systems.

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the
  Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: It's possible for legitimate administrative actions or automated
  processes to trigger this detection, especially if there are bulk modifications
  to Okta IDP lifecycle events. Review the context of the modification, such as the
  user making the change and the specific lifecycle event modified, to determine if
  it aligns with expected behavior.
