status: production
type: Hunting
description: The following analytic identifies unauthorized forwarder bundle downloads
  from Splunk Deployment Servers. It leverages native Splunk logs, specifically the
  `splunkd` component "PackageDownloadRestHandler," to detect instances where an unauthenticated
  client may have downloaded forwarder bundles. This activity is significant because
  it could indicate a potential security breach, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive
  configurations and applications. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain
  insights into the deployment server's environment, potentially leading to further
  exploitation or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd` component="PackageDownloadRestHandler" | stats values(app) values(serverclass)
  by peer, host | `splunk_process_injection_forwarder_bundle_downloads_filter`'
how_to_implement: This hunting search uses native logs produced when a deployment
  server is within your environment. Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook
  that walks an analyst through the process of running these hunting searches in the
  references list of this detection. In order to use this workbook, a user will need
  to run a curl command to post the file to their SOAR instance such as "curl -u username:password
  https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template -d @splunk_psa_0622.json".
  A user should then create an empty container or case, attach the workbook, and begin
  working through the tasks.
known_false_positives: None at this time.
