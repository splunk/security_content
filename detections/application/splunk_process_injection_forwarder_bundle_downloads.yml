description: On June 14th, 2022, Splunk released a security advisory relating to the
  authentication that happens between Universal Forwarders and Deployment Servers.
  In some circumstances, an unauthenticated client can download forwarder bundles
  from the Deployment Server. This hunting search pulls a full list of forwarder bundle
  downloads where the peer column is the forwarder, the host column is the Deployment
  Server, and then you have a list of the apps downloaded and the serverclasses in
  which the peer is a member of. You should look for apps or clients that you do not
  recognize as being part of your environment.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd` component="PackageDownloadRestHandler" | stats values(app) values(serverclass)
  by peer, host | `splunk_process_injection_forwarder_bundle_downloads_filter`'
how_to_implement: This hunting search uses native logs produced when a deployment
  server is within your environment. Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook
  that walks an analyst through the process of running these hunting searches in the
  references list of this detection. In order to use this workbook, a user will need
  to run a curl command to post the file to their SOAR instance such as "curl -u username:password
  https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template -d @splunk_psa_0622.json".
  A user should then create an empty container or case, attach the workbook, and begin
  working through the tasks.
known_false_positives: None at this time.
