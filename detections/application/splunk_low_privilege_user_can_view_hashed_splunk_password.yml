description: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.0.5, 8.2.11, and 8.1.14, a low-privilege user who holds the user role can see the hashed version of the initial user name and password for the Splunk instance by using the rest SPL command against the conf-user-seed REST endpoint. This can lead to a privilege escalation that lets the user take over the admin account on the instance.
search: '`splunkd_web` uri="*/servicesNS/nobody/system/configs/conf-user-seed*" | stats earliest(_time) as event_time values(method) as method values(status) as
  status values(clientip) as clientip values(useragent) as useragent values(file) as file by user | convert ctime(*time) | `splunk_low_privilege_user_can_view_hashed_splunk_password_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _audit index. This detection may assist in efforts to discover attempts to access con-user-seed file content.
known_false_positives: This search may produce false positives as accounts with high privileges may access this file. Operator will need to investigate these actions in order to discern exploitation attempts.
