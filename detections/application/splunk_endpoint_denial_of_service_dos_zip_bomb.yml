description: This search allows operator to identify Splunk search app crashes resulting
  from specially crafted ZIP file using file monitoring that affects UF versions 8.1.11
  and 8.2 versions below 8.2.7.1. It is not possible to detect Zip Bomb attack before
  crash. This search will provide Universal Forwarder errors from uploaded binary
  files (zip compression) which are used for this attack. If an analyst sees results
  from this search we suggest you investigate and triage what zip file was uploaded,
  zip compressed files may have different extensions.
