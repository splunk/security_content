data_source:
- Splunk
description: An unauthorized user can use the /services/indexing/preview REST endpoint to overwrite search results if they know the search ID (SID) of an existing search job.
search: '`splunkda` method="POST" uri="*/services/indexing/preview*" | table host clientip status useragent user uri_path | `splunk_rbac_bypass_on_indexing_preview_rest_endpoint_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search does not require additional data ingestion. It requires the ability to search _internal index. 
known_false_positives: This is a hunting search which provides verbose results against this endpoint. Operator must consider things such as IP address, useragent and user(specially low privelege) and host to investigate possible attack.
