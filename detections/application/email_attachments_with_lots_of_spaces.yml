description: The following analytic detects email attachments with an unusually high
  number of spaces in their file names, which is a common tactic used by attackers
  to obfuscate file extensions. It leverages the Email data model to identify attachments
  where the ratio of spaces to the total file name length exceeds 10%. This behavior
  is significant as it may indicate an attempt to bypass security filters and deliver
  malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to the execution
  of harmful code or unauthorized access to sensitive information within the recipient's
  environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(All_Email.recipient)
  as recipient_address min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Email
  where All_Email.file_name="*" by All_Email.src_user, All_Email.file_name All_Email.message_id
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Email")`
  | eval space_ratio = (mvcount(split(file_name," "))-1)/len(file_name) | search space_ratio
  >= 0.1 |  rex field=recipient_address "(?<recipient_user>.*)@" | `email_attachments_with_lots_of_spaces_filter`'
how_to_implement: 'You need to ingest data from emails. Specifically, the sender''s
  address and the file names of any attachments must be mapped to the Email data model.
  The threshold ratio is set to 10%, but this value can be configured to suit each
  environment.

  **Splunk Phantom Playbook Integration**

  If Splunk Phantom is also configured in your environment, a playbook called "Suspicious
  Email Attachment Investigate and Delete" can be configured to run when any results
  are found by this detection search. To use this integration, install the Phantom
  App for Splunk `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/` and add the correct hostname
  to the "Phantom Instance" field in the Adaptive Response Actions when configuring
  this detection search. The notable event will be sent to Phantom and the playbook
  will gather further information about the file attachment and its network behaviors.
  If Phantom finds malicious behavior and an analyst approves of the results, the
  email will be deleted from the user''s inbox.'
