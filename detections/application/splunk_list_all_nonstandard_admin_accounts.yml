description: 'This search will enumerate all Splunk Accounts with administrative rights
  on this instance.  It deliberately ignores the default admin account since this
  is assumed to be present.  This search may help in a detection the Cross-Site Scripting
  Attack listed: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, a
  View allows for Cross-Site Scripting in an XML View through the ''layoutPanel''
  attribute in the ''module'' tag. The vulnerability affects instances with Splunk
  Web enabled.'

search: '| rest splunk_server=local /services/authentication/users |search capabilities=admin*
  OR imported_capabilities=admin* title!=admin | table title roles capabilities splunk_server
  | `splunk_list_all_nonstandard_admin_accounts_filter`'
how_to_implement: The user running this search is required to have a permission allowing
  them to dispatch REST requests to indexers (the `dispatch_rest_to_indexers` capability)
  in some architectures.  If there have been admin account, in addition to the standard
  admin account, intentionally created on this server, then edit the filter macro
  to exclude them.
known_false_positives: It is not possible to discern from the user table whether or
  not users with admin rights have been created intentionally, accidentally, or as
  a result of exploitation. Each user with these rights should be investigated and,
  if legitimate, added to the filter macro above.  If a user is not believed to be
  legitimate, then further investigation should take place.
