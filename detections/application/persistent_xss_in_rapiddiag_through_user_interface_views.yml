description: The following analytic identifies potential persistent Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS) attacks in Splunk Enterprise 9.0 versions before 9.0.4 through user interface
  views. It leverages audit logs from the `audit_searches` data source to detect actions
  involving Base64-encoded images in error messages. This activity is significant
  because it can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context
  of other users, leading to unauthorized actions or data exposure. If confirmed malicious,
  this could result in persistent control over the affected Splunk instance, compromising
  its integrity and confidentiality.
search: "`audit_searches` path=/opt/splunk/etc/users/*/search/local/data/ui/views/*
  action=* |table user action roles info roles path | dedup user action | `persistent_xss_in_rapiddiag_through_user_interface_views_filter`"
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _internal index
known_false_positives: This is a hunting search, it will not deobfuscate base64 payload,
  it provides however it will provide what user added the view artifact and what user
  opened it. It will require further investigation based on the information presented
  by this hunting search.
