type: Anomaly
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies instances where more than 10 unique user accounts have failed to authenticate from a single IP address within a 5-minute window in an Okta tenant. This detection uses OktaIm2 logs ingested via the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud. Such activity is significant as it may indicate brute-force attacks or password spraying attempts. If confirmed malicious, this behavior suggests an external entity is attempting to compromise multiple user accounts, potentially leading to unauthorized access to organizational resources and data breaches.

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: A source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple users in a short period of time is not common legitimate behavior.
