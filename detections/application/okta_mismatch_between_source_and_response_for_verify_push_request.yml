description: 'The following analytic identifies discrepancies between the source and
  response events for Okta Verify Push requests, indicating potential suspicious behavior.
  It leverages Okta System Log events, specifically `system.push.send_factor_verify_push`
  and `user.authentication.auth_via_mfa` with the factor "OKTA_VERIFY_PUSH." The detection
  groups events by SessionID, calculates the ratio of successful sign-ins to push
  requests, and checks for session roaming and new device/IP usage. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate push spam or unauthorized access attempts. If
  confirmed malicious, attackers could bypass MFA, leading to unauthorized access
  to sensitive systems.'

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the
  Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on organization size and
  configuration of Okta. Monitor, tune and filter as needed.
