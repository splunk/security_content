description: 'The following analytic identifies variations in client-based values for source and response events to identify suspicious request behavior. The detection is enhanced if the org is evaluating behavior conditions in sign-on policies using Okta Behavior Detection. NOTE: This detection requires the use of Okta Identity Engine (OIE) and will not function on Okta Classic.\

  For each Okta Verify Push challenge, the following two events are recorded in Okta System Log \
  
  Source of Push (Sign-In) \

  eventType eq \"system.push.send_factor_verify_push\" \

  User Push Response (Okta Verify client) \

  eventType eq "user.authentication.auth_via_mfa" AND debugContext.debugData.factor eq "OKTA_VERIFY_PUSH" \

  In sequence, the logic for the analytic - \
  
  * Groups by SessionID and retrieves any system.push.send_factor_verify_push events (the source of the push) and user.authentication.auth_via_mfa events where the factor is OKTA_VERIFY_PUSH - (the user response to the push) \

  * Counts the total number of push events, successful authentication events, and any push sources where the client is a new device. \
  * Creates a ratio of successful sign-ins to pushes. \

  * If the ratio (currently tuned aggressively) indicates push spam, or if a user has rejected a push, the detection proceeds to evaluate whether there is more than one IP address used during the session (session roaming) and the presence of both a new IP and new device during the session.'

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on organization size and configuration of Okta. Monitor, tune and filter as needed.
