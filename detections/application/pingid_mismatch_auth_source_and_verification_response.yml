description: The following analytic identifies variations in the authentication event IP address versus the verification response event IP address to identify suspicious sign-in behavior. Currently this detection is configured to identify when the originating country of an authentication request is different than the verification country.

how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest JSON logging from a PingID(PingOne) enterprise environment, either via Webhook or Push Subscription.
known_false_positives: False positives may be generated by users working out the geographic region where the organizations services or technology is hosted.
