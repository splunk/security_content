data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '`splunkda` uri_path="/servicesNS/nobody/splunk_secure_gateway/storage/collections/data/mobile_alerts*"
  sort="notification.created_at:-1" | table  clientip file host method uri_query sort
  | `splunk_rce_via_splunk_secure_gateway__splunk_mobile_alerts_feature_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search only applies if Splunk Mobile Gateway is deployed in
  the vulnerable Splunk versions.
known_false_positives: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data.
  The detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. Focus of this
  search is "uri_path=/servicesNS/nobody/splunk_secure_gateway/storage/collections/data/mobile_alerts*"
  which is the injection point.
