type: Anomaly
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies successful single-factor authentication
  events against the Okta Dashboard for accounts without Multi-Factor Authentication
  (MFA) enabled. It detects this activity by analyzing Okta logs for successful authentication
  events where "Okta Verify" is not used. This behavior is significant as it may indicate
  a misconfiguration, policy violation, or potential account takeover. If confirmed
  malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the account, potentially
  leading to data breaches or further exploitation within the environment.
search: '`okta`  action=success src_user_type = User eventType = user.authentication.verify
  OR eventType = user.authentication.auth_via_mfa| stats dc(eventType) values(eventType)
  as eventType values(target{}.displayName) as targets values(debugContext.debugData.url)
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(authentication_method) by
  src_ip user action | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | search targets !="Okta Verify" | `okta_successful_single_factor_authentication_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection utilizes logs from Okta environments and requires
  the ingestion of OktaIm2 logs through the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud
  (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: Although not recommended, certain users may be exempt from
  multi-factor authentication. Adjust the filter as necessary.
