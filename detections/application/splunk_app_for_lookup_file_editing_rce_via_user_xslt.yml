name: Splunk App for Lookup File Editing RCE via User XSLT
id: a053e6a6-2146-483a-9798-2d43652f3299
version: 1
date: '2023-11-16'
author: Rod Soto, Splunk
status: experimental
type: Hunting
data_source: []
description: This search provides information to investigate possible remote code execution exploitation via 
  user-supplied Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), affecting Splunk versions 9.1.x.
search: '| rest splunk_server=local /services/data/lookup-table-files/ 
  | fields title author disabled eai:acl.app eai:acl.owner eai:acl.sharing eai:appName eai:data 
  | `splunk_app_for_lookup_file_editing_rce_via_user_xslt_filter`'
how_to_implement: Because there is no way to detect the payload, this search only provides the ability to monitor 
  the creation of lookups which are the base of this exploit. An operator must then investigate suspicious lookups. 
  This search requires ability to perform REST queries. Note that if the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing is not, 
  or was not, installed in the Splunk environment then it is not necessary to run the search as the enviornment 
  was not vulnerable. 
known_false_positives: This search will provide information for investigation and hunting of lookup creation via 
  user-supplied XSLT which may be indications of possible exploitation. There will be false positives as it is 
  not possible to detect the payload executed via this exploit.
