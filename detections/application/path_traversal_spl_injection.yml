name: Path traversal SPL injection

type: TTP
description: On May 3rd, 2022, Splunk published a security advisory for a Path traversal
  in search parameter that can potentiall allow SPL injection. An attacker can cause
  the application to load data from incorrect endpoints, urls leading to outcomes
  such as running arbitrary SPL queries.
data_source: []
search: ' `path_traversal_spl_injection` | search "\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/"  |
  stats count by host status clientip method uri_path uri_query | `path_traversal_spl_injection_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. This search will
  provide search UI requests with path traversal parameter ("../../../../../../../../../")
  which shows exploitation attempts. This detection is meant for on premise environments,
  and if executed on internet facing servers without a WAF may produce a lot of results.
  This detection will not work against obfuscated path traversal requests.
known_false_positives: This search may find additional path traversal exploitation
  attempts.
