description: The following analytic identifies attempts by users to access Okta applications that have not been assigned to them. It leverages Okta Identity Management logs, specifically focusing on failed access attempts to unassigned applications. This activity is significant for a SOC as it may indicate potential unauthorized access attempts, which could lead to exposure of sensitive information or disruption of services. If confirmed malicious, such activity could result in data breaches, non-compliance with data protection laws, and overall compromise of the IT environment.
search: '| tstats values(Authentication.app) as app values(Authentication.action) as action values(Authentication.user) as user values(Authentication.reason) as reason from datamodel=Authentication where Authentication.signature=app.generic.unauth_app_access_attempt Authentication.action="failure" by _time Authentication.src Authentication.user | `drop_dm_object_name("Authentication")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | iplocation src | `okta_unauthorized_access_to_application_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection utilizes logs from Okta Identity Management (IM) environments and requires the ingestion of OktaIm2 logs through the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: There is a possibility that a user may accidentally click on the wrong application, which could trigger this event. It is advisable to verify the location from which this activity originates.
