search: '`splunk_crash_log` "*Segmentation fault*" | stats count by host _time | `splunk_dos_via_dump_spl_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search does not require additional ingestion of data. Requires the ability to search _internal index and monitor segmentation faults.
known_false_positives: Segmentation faults may occur due to other causes, so this search may produce false positives
