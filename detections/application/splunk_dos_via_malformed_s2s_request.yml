description: On March 24th, 2022, Splunk published a security advisory for a possible
  Denial of Service stemming from the lack of validation in a specific key-value field
  in the Splunk-to-Splunk (S2S) protocol. This detection will alert on attempted exploitation
  in patched versions of Splunk.

search: '`splunkd` log_level="ERROR" component="TcpInputProc" thread_name="FwdDataReceiverThread"
  "Invalid _meta atom" | table host, src | `splunk_dos_via_malformed_s2s_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. This detection
  will only find attempted exploitation on versions of Splunk already patched for
  CVE-2021-3422.
known_false_positives: None.
