description: The following analytic identifies when a new device is enrolled on an Okta account. This behavior is indicative of a user adding a new device to their account. This activity is common when a user is setting up a new device or when a user has lost access to their previous device. However, this activity can also be indicative of an adversary adding a new device to an account to maintain access to an account. Monitoring for this activity can help detect potential account takeover attempts or unauthorized access to Okta accounts.

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: It is possible that the user has legitimately added a new device to their account. Please verify this activity.
