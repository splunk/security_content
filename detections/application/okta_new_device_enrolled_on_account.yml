description: The following analytic identifies when a new device is enrolled on an
  Okta account. It uses OktaIm2 logs ingested via the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity
  Cloud to detect the creation of new device enrollments. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate a legitimate user setting up a new device or an adversary adding
  a device to maintain unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
  to potential account takeover, unauthorized access, and persistent control over
  the compromised Okta account. Monitoring this behavior is crucial for detecting
  and mitigating unauthorized access attempts.

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the
  Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: It is possible that the user has legitimately added a new device
  to their account. Please verify this activity.
