description:
  This correlation computes the risk events associated with the detection analytics from "Suspicious Okta Activity", "Okta Account Takeover", and "Okta MFA Exhaustion" analytic stories. This analytic will trigger a notable event in your incident review when there are 5 or more distinct TTPs related to these analytic stories in the last 24 hours. This incident highlights potentially suspicious activity by a compromised user.

how_to_implement:
  This search leverages the Risk Framework from Enterprise Security. Ensure that "Suspicious Okta Activity", "Okta Account Takeover", and "Okta MFA Exhaustion" analytic stories are enabled. TTPs may be set to Notables for point detections; anomalies should not be notables but rather risk generators. The correlation relies on risk before generating a notable. Modify the value as needed.
known_false_positives:
  False positives will be limited to the number of events generated by the analytics tied to the stories. Analytics will need to be tested and tuned, and the risk score reduced as needed based on the organization.
