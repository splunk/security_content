description: The following correlation identifies when a user exceeds a risk threshold based on multiple suspicious Okta activities. It leverages the Risk Framework from Enterprise Security, aggregating risk events from "Suspicious Okta Activity," "Okta Account Takeover," and "Okta MFA Exhaustion" analytic stories. This detection is significant as it highlights potentially compromised user accounts exhibiting multiple tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) within a 24-hour period. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate a serious security breach, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment.

how_to_implement: This search leverages the Risk Framework from Enterprise Security. Ensure that "Suspicious Okta Activity", "Okta Account Takeover", and "Okta MFA Exhaustion" analytic stories are enabled. TTPs may be set to Notables for point detections; anomalies should not be notables but rather risk generators. The correlation relies on risk before generating a notable. Modify the value as needed.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to the number of events generated by the analytics tied to the stories. Analytics will need to be tested and tuned, and the risk score reduced as needed based on the organization.
