status: production
type: Hunting
data_source:
- Splunk
description: A low-privilege user who holds a role that has the edit_user capability assigned to it can escalate their privileges to that of the admin user by providing specially crafted web requests.
search: '`audittrail` action IN ("change_own_password","password_change","edit_password") AND info="granted" AND NOT user IN (admin, splunk-system-user) | stats earliest(_time) as event_time values(index) as index values(sourcetype) as sourcetype values(action) as action values(info) as info by user | `splunk_edit_user_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _audit index. This detection may assist in efforts to discover abuse of edit_user privilege. 
known_false_positives: This search may produce false positives as password changing actions may be part of normal behavior. Operator will need to investigate these actions in order to discern exploitation attempts.
