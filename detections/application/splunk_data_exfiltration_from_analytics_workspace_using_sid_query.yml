name: Splunk Data exfiltration from Analytics Workspace using sid query
id: b6d77c6c-f011-4b03-8650-8f10edb7c4a8
version: 1
date: '2022-11-01'
author: Rod Soto, Eric McGinnis
status: production
type: Hunting
description: This hunting search allows operator to discover attempts to exfiltrate
  data by executing a prepositioned malicious search ID in Analytic Workspace in Splunk
  Enterprise versions 8.2.9,8.1.12,9.0.2. The attack is browser-based. It requires
  the attacker to compel a victim to initiate a request within their browser (phishing).
  The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability at will.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '`audit_searches` info=granted search NOT ("audit_searches") search NOT ("security_content_summariesonly")
  AND ((search="*mstats*[*]*" AND provenance="N/A") OR (search="*mstats*\\\"*[*]*\\\"*"))|
  eval warning=if(match(search,"\\\\\""), "POTENTIAL INJECTION STAGING", "POTENTIAL
  INJECTION EXECUTION") | table search, user, warning, timestamp | `splunk_data_exfiltration_from_analytics_workspace_using_sid_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: The vulnerability affects only instances with Splunk Web Enabled.  After
  running this search, please run "Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky
  SPL MLTK" to gain more insight into potentially risky commands which could lead
  to data exfiltration.
known_false_positives: This search may produce false positives.  This detection does
  not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to
  search the _audit index. Special attention must be paid to "/en-US/app/search/analytics_workspace?sid=[sid]"
  which is where the malicious code will be inserted to trigger attack at victim.
