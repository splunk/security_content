description: Splunk Enterprise versions 8.1.12, 8.2.9, 9.0.2 are vulnerable to persistent
  cross site scripting via Data Model object name. An authenticated user can inject
  and store arbitrary scripts that can lead to persistent cross-site scripting (XSS)
  in the object name Data Model.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd_webx` uri=/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/*/launcher/datamodel/model*
  uri_query!=null | stats count by _time host status clientip user uri | `splunk_stored_xss_via_data_model_objectname_field_filter`'
how_to_implement: This vulnerability only affects Splunk Web enabled instances. This
  detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require
  the ability to search the _internal index.
known_false_positives: This search may produce false positives and does not cover
  exploitation attempts via code obfuscation, focus of search is suspicious requests
  against "/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/*/launcher/datamodel/model" which is the
  injection point.
