description: The following analytic detects attempts to perform a denial of service
  (DoS) attack through investigation attachments in Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)
  versions below 7.1.2. It leverages internal Splunk logs, specifically monitoring
  the `splunkd_investigation_rest_handler` for error statuses related to investigation
  objects. This activity is significant because it can render the Investigation feature
  inaccessible, disrupting incident response and forensic analysis. If confirmed malicious,
  this attack could prevent security teams from effectively managing and investigating
  security incidents, leading to prolonged exposure and potential data breaches.
search: '`splunkd_investigation_rest_handler` status=error object=investigation |
  stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(status) as status values(msg)
  as msg values(id) as investigation_id by user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `splunk_es_dos_through_investigation_attachments_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requires access to internal indexes, only affects Enterprise
  Security versions below 7.1.2.
known_false_positives: This search will show the exact DoS event via error message
  and investigation id. The error however does not point exactly at the uploader as
  any users associated with the investigation will be affected. Operator must investigate
  using investigation id the possible origin of the malicious upload. Attack only
  affects specific investigation not the investigation manager.
