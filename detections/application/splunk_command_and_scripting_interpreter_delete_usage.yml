status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies the use of the risky command - Delete
  - that may be utilized in Splunk to delete some or all data queried for. In order
  to use Delete in Splunk, one must be assigned the role. This is typically not used
  and should generate an anomaly if it is used.
data_source: 
- Splunk
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Splunk_Audit.Search_Activity where Search_Activity.search
  IN ("*| delete*") Search_Activity.search_type=adhoc Search_Activity.user!=splunk-system-user
  by Search_Activity.search Search_Activity.info Search_Activity.total_run_time Search_Activity.user
  Search_Activity.search_type | `drop_dm_object_name(Search_Activity)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `splunk_command_and_scripting_interpreter_delete_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search acceleration is recommended
  against the Search_Activity datamodel that runs against the splunk _audit index.
  In addition, this analytic requires the Common Information Model App which includes
  the Splunk Audit Datamodel https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if this command is used as a
  common practice. Filter as needed.
