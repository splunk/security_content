description:
  'The following analytic identifies multiple failed app requests in an attempt to identify the reuse a stolen web session cookie. The logic of the analytic is as follows: 
  * Retrieves policy evaluation and SSO details in events that contain the Application requested 

  * Formats target fields so we can aggregate specifically on Applications (AppInstances) 

  * Groups by User, Session and IP 

  * Creates a ratio of successful SSO events to total MFA challenges related to Application Sign On Policies 

  * Alerts when more than half of app sign on events are unsuccessful, and challenges were unsatisfied for more than three apps.'

how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta:im2 logs to be ingested.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on organization size and configuration of Okta.
