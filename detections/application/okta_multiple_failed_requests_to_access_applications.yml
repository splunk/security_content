description: 'The following analytic detects multiple failed attempts to access applications
  in Okta, potentially indicating the reuse of a stolen web session cookie. It leverages
  Okta logs to evaluate policy and SSO events, aggregating data by user, session,
  and IP. The detection triggers when more than half of the app sign-on attempts are
  unsuccessful across multiple applications. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an attempt to bypass authentication mechanisms. If confirmed malicious,
  it could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive applications and data, posing
  a significant security risk.'

how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta:im2 logs to
  be ingested.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on organization size and
  configuration of Okta.
