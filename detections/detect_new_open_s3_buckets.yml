description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user has created an open/public
  S3 bucket.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), and then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. The threshold value should be tuned to your environment.

known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose.
  That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to the "All Users"
  group.
