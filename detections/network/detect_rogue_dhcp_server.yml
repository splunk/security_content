description: The following analytic identifies the presence of unauthorized DHCP servers
  on the network. It leverages logs from Cisco network devices with DHCP Snooping
  enabled, specifically looking for events where DHCP leases are issued from untrusted
  ports. This activity is significant because rogue DHCP servers can facilitate Man-in-the-Middle
  attacks, leading to potential data interception and network disruption. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow attackers to redirect network traffic, capture sensitive
  information, and compromise the integrity of the network.

how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must be configured with DHCP Snooping enabled (see
  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-0_2_EX/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg_chapter_01101.html)
  and log with a severity level of minimum "5 - notification". The search also requires
  that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)
  is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.
known_false_positives: This search might be prone to high false positives if DHCP
  Snooping has been incorrectly configured or in the unlikely event that the DHCP
  server has been moved to another network interface.
