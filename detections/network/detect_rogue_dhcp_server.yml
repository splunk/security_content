description: By enabling DHCP Snooping as a Layer 2 Security measure on the organization's 
  network devices, we will be able to detect unauthorized DHCP servers handing out DHCP
  leases to devices on the network (Man in the Middle attack).
how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must be configured with DHCP Snooping enabled
  (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-0_2_EX/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg_chapter_01101.html)
  and log with a severity level of minimum "5 - notification".
  The search also requires that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk 
  (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467) is used to
  parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.

known_false_positives: This search might be prone to high false positives if
  DHCP Snooping has been incorrectly configured or in the unlikely event that 
  the DHCP server has been moved to another network interface.
