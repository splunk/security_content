description: The following analytic detects the initiation of traffic mirroring sessions
  on Cisco network devices. It leverages logs with specific mnemonics and facilities
  related to traffic mirroring, such as "ETH_SPAN_SESSION_UP" and "PKTCAP_START."
  This activity is significant because adversaries may use traffic mirroring to exfiltrate
  data by duplicating and forwarding network traffic to an external destination. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to capture sensitive information,
  monitor network communications, and potentially compromise the integrity and confidentiality
  of the network.
data_source: []
search: '`cisco_networks` (facility="MIRROR" mnemonic="ETH_SPAN_SESSION_UP") OR (facility="SPAN"
  mnemonic="SESSION_UP") OR (facility="SPAN" mnemonic="PKTCAP_START") OR (mnemonic="CFGLOG_LOGGEDCMD"
  command="monitor session*") | stats min(_time) AS firstTime max(_time) AS lastTime
  count BY host facility mnemonic | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_traffic_mirroring_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must log with a severity level of minimum "5 - notification".
  The search also requires that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)
  is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices and that the devices have
  been configured according to the documentation of the Cisco Networks Add-on. Also
  note that an attacker may disable logging from the device prior to enabling traffic
  mirroring.
known_false_positives: This search will return false positives for any legitimate
  traffic captures by network administrators.
