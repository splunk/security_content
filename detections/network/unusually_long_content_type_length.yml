description: The following analytic identifies unusually long strings in the Content-Type
  HTTP header sent by the client to the server. It uses data from the Stream:HTTP
  source, specifically evaluating the length of the `cs_content_type` field. This
  activity is significant because excessively long Content-Type headers can indicate
  attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or evade detection mechanisms. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute code, manipulate data,
  or bypass security controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data
  breaches.
data_source: []
search: '`stream_http` | eval cs_content_type_length = len(cs_content_type) | where
  cs_content_type_length > 100 | table endtime src_ip dest_ip cs_content_type_length
  cs_content_type url | `unusually_long_content_type_length_filter`'
how_to_implement: This particular search leverages data extracted from Stream:HTTP.
  You must configure the http stream using the Splunk Stream App on your Splunk Stream
  deployment server to extract the cs_content_type field.
known_false_positives: Very few legitimate Content-Type fields will have a length
  greater than 100 characters.
