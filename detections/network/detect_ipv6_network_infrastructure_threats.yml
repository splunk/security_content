description: By enabling IPv6 First Hop Security as a Layer 2 Security measure on
  the organization's network devices, we will be able to detect various attacks such
  as packet forging in the Infrastructure.
how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must be configured with one or more First Hop Security
  measures such as RA Guard, DHCP Guard and/or device tracking. See References for
  more information. The search also requires that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk
  (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467) is used to parse the logs from the Cisco
  network devices.
