description: The following analytic detects IPv6 network infrastructure threats by
  identifying suspicious activities such as IP and MAC address theft or packet drops.
  It leverages logs from Cisco network devices configured with First Hop Security
  measures like RA Guard and DHCP Guard. This activity is significant as it can indicate
  attempts to compromise network integrity and security. If confirmed malicious, attackers
  could manipulate network traffic, leading to potential data interception, unauthorized
  access, or network disruption.

how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must be configured with one or more First Hop Security
  measures such as RA Guard, DHCP Guard and/or device tracking. See References for
  more information. The search also requires that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk
  (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467) is used to parse the logs from the Cisco
  network devices.
