description: The following analytic detects instances where network traffic, specifically identified by port and transport layer protocol as 
  prohibited in the "lookup_interesting_ports" table, is allowed according to the Network_Traffic data model. It operates by cross-referencing 
  traffic data against predefined security policies to identify discrepancies indicative of potential misconfigurations or policy violations. 
  This detection is crucial for a Security Operations Center (SOC) as it highlights potential security breaches or misconfigured network devices 
  that could allow unauthorized access or data exfiltration, directly impacting the organization's security posture.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.action = allowed by
  All_Traffic.src_ip All_Traffic.dest_ip All_Traffic.dest_port All_Traffic.action
  | lookup update=true interesting_ports_lookup dest_port as All_Traffic.dest_port
  OUTPUT app is_prohibited note transport | search is_prohibited=true | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")` | `prohibited_network_traffic_allowed_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from firewalls or other network control devices that mediate the traffic allowed
  into an environment. This is necessary so that the search can identify an 'action'
  taken on the traffic of interest. The search requires the Network_Traffic data model
  be populated.
