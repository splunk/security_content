description: The following analytic detects instances where network traffic, identified
  by port and transport layer protocol as prohibited in the "lookup_interesting_ports"
  table, is allowed. It uses the Network_Traffic data model to cross-reference traffic
  data against predefined security policies. This activity is significant for a SOC
  as it highlights potential misconfigurations or policy violations that could lead
  to unauthorized access or data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow attackers to bypass network defenses, leading to potential data breaches and
  compromising the organization's security posture.

how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from firewalls or other network control devices that mediate the traffic allowed
  into an environment. This is necessary so that the search can identify an 'action'
  taken on the traffic of interest. The search requires the Network_Traffic data model
  be populated.
