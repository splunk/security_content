description: The following analytic detects a high volume of outbound web traffic,
  specifically over 1GB of data sent to a URL within a 2-minute window. It leverages
  the Web data model to identify significant uploads by analyzing the sum of bytes
  out. This activity is significant as it may indicate potential data exfiltration
  by malware or malicious insiders. If confirmed as malicious, this behavior could
  lead to unauthorized data transfer, resulting in data breaches and loss of sensitive
  information. Immediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of
  the transfer and mitigate any potential threats.
search: '| tstats  `security_content_summariesonly` count sum(Web.bytes_out) as sum_bytes_out
  values(Web.user) as user values(Web.app) as app values(Web.dest) as dest from datamodel=Web
  by _time span=2m Web.url Web.src sourcetype | search sum_bytes_out > 1070000000
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")`| `high_volume_of_bytes_out_to_url_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on Web traffic that include fields relavent for traffic into the `Web` datamodel.
  Please adjust the threshold for the sum of bytes out as per your environment and
  user behavior.
known_false_positives: This search may trigger false positives if there is a legitimate
  reason for a high volume of bytes out to a URL. We recommend to investigate these
  findings. Consider updating the filter macro to exclude the applications that are
  relevant to your environment.
