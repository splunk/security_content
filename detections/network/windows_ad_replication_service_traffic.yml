description: The following analytic identifies unexpected Active Directory replication
  traffic from non-domain controller sources. It leverages data from the Network Traffic
  datamodel, specifically looking for applications related to AD replication. This
  activity is significant because AD replication traffic should typically only occur
  between domain controllers. Detection of such traffic from other sources may indicate
  malicious activities like DCSync or DCShadow, which are used for credential dumping.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive credentials,
  leading to unauthorized access and potential domain-wide compromise.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(All_Traffic.transport)
  as transport values(All_Traffic.user) as user values(All_Traffic.src_category) as
  src_category values(All_Traffic.dest_category) as dest_category min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.app IN ("ms-dc-replication","*drsr*","ad
  drs") by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest All_Traffic.app | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")` | `windows_ad_replication_service_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  application aware firewall or proxy logs into the Network Datamodel. Categorize
  all known domain controller Assets servers with an appropriate category for filtering.
known_false_positives: New domain controllers or certian scripts run by administrators.
