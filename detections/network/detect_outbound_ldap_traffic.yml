name: Detect Outbound LDAP Traffic

version: 1

author: Bhavin Patel, Johan Bjerke, Splunk
type: Hunting
datamodel:
- Network_Traffic
description: Malicious actors often abuse misconfigured LDAP servers or applications
  that use the LDAP servers in organizations. Outbound LDAP traffic should not be
  allowed outbound through your perimeter firewall.  This search will help determine
  if you have any LDAP connections to IP addresses outside of private (RFC1918) address
  space.
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as earliest_time latest(_time) as latest_time values(All_Traffic.dest_ip)
  as dest_ip from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic where All_Traffic.dest_port
  = 389 OR All_Traffic.dest_port = 636 AND NOT (All_Traffic.dest_ip = 10.0.0.0/8 OR
  All_Traffic.dest_ip=192.168.0.0/16 OR All_Traffic.dest_ip = 172.16.0.0/12) by All_Traffic.src_ip
  All_Traffic.dest_ip |`drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")` | where src_ip != dest_ip
  | `security_content_ctime(latest_time)`  | `security_content_ctime(earliest_time)`
  |`detect_outbound_ldap_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Zeek DNS and Zeek Conn data into Splunk. Zeek
  data should also be getting ingested in JSON format and should be mapped to the
  Network Traffic datamodels that are in use for this search.
known_false_positives: Unknown at this moment. Outbound LDAP traffic should not be
  allowed outbound through your perimeter firewall. Please check those servers to
  verify if the activity is legitimate.
