type: Hunting
description: The following analytic identifies outbound LDAP traffic to external IP
  addresses. It leverages the Network_Traffic data model to detect connections on
  ports 389 or 636 that are not directed to private IP ranges (RFC1918). This activity
  is significant because outbound LDAP traffic can indicate potential data exfiltration
  or unauthorized access attempts. If confirmed malicious, attackers could exploit
  this to access sensitive directory information, leading to data breaches or further
  network compromise.

search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as earliest_time latest(_time) as latest_time values(All_Traffic.dest_ip)
  as dest_ip from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic where All_Traffic.dest_port
  = 389 OR All_Traffic.dest_port = 636 AND NOT (All_Traffic.dest_ip = 10.0.0.0/8 OR
  All_Traffic.dest_ip=192.168.0.0/16 OR All_Traffic.dest_ip = 172.16.0.0/12) by All_Traffic.src_ip

  | `security_content_ctime(latest_time)`  | `security_content_ctime(earliest_time)`
  |`detect_outbound_ldap_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data from Next Generation Firewalls like Palo Alto Networks Firewalls or other network control devices that mediate the traffic allowed into an environment. The search requires the Network_Traffic data model to be populated.
known_false_positives: Unknown at this moment. Outbound LDAP traffic should not be
  allowed outbound through your perimeter firewall. Please check those servers to
  verify if the activity is legitimate.
