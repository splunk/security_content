description: The following analytic identifies excessive DNS query failures by counting DNS responses that do not indicate success, triggering when there are more than 50 occurrences. It leverages the Network_Resolution data model, focusing on DNS reply codes that signify errors. This activity is significant because a high number of DNS failures can indicate potential network misconfigurations, DNS poisoning attempts, or malware communication issues. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to disrupted network services, hindered communication, or data exfiltration attempts by attackers.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you must ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
known_false_positives: It is possible legitimate traffic can trigger this rule. Please investigate as appropriate. The threshold for generating an event can also be customized to better suit your environment.
