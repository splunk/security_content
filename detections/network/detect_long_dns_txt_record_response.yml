description: This search is used to detect attempts to use DNS tunneling, by calculating
  the length of responses to DNS TXT queries. Endpoints using DNS as a method of transmission
  for data exfiltration, command and control, or evasion of security controls can
  often be detected by noting unusually large volumes of DNS traffic.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to ingest data from
  your DNS logs, or monitor DNS traffic using Stream, Bro or something similar. Specifically,
  this query requires that the DNS data model is populated with information regarding
  the DNS record type that is being returned as well as the data in the answer section
  of the protocol.

known_false_positives: It's possible that legitimate TXT record responses can be long
  enough to trigger this search. You can modify the packet threshold for this search
  to help mitigate false positives.
