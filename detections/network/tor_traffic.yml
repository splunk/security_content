description: The following analytic identifies allowed network traffic to The Onion
  Router (TOR), an anonymity network often exploited for malicious activities. It
  leverages data from Next Generation Firewalls, using the Network_Traffic data model
  to detect traffic where the application is TOR and the action is allowed. This activity
  is significant as TOR can be used to bypass conventional monitoring, facilitating
  hacking, data breaches, and illicit content dissemination. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and severe compliance
  violations, compromising the integrity and security of the network.
data_source:
- Palo Alto Network Traffic
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.app=tor AND All_Traffic.action=allowed
  by All_Traffic.src_ip All_Traffic.dest_ip All_Traffic.dest_port All_Traffic.action
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")`
  | `tor_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from Next Generation Firewalls like Palo Alto Networks Firewalls or other network
  control devices that mediate the traffic allowed into an environment. This is necessary
  so that the search can identify an 'action' taken on the traffic of interest. The
  search requires the Network_Traffic data model to be populated.
