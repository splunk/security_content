description: This search looks for network traffic identified as The Onion Router
  (TOR), a benign anonymity network which can be abused for a variety of nefarious
  purposes.
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from firewalls or other network control devices that mediate the traffic allowed
  into an environment. This is necessary so that the search can identify an 'action'
  taken on the traffic of interest. The search requires the Network_Traffic data model
  be populated.
