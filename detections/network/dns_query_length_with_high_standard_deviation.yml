description: The following analytic identifies DNS queries with unusually large lengths by computing the standard deviation of query lengths and filtering those exceeding twice the standard deviation. It leverages DNS query data from the Network_Resolution data model, focusing on the length of the domain names being resolved. This activity is significant as unusually long DNS queries can indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication attempts. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to stealthily transfer data or maintain persistent communication channels within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Resolution where NOT DNS.record_type IN("Pointer","PTR") by DNS.query host| `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")` | eval tlds=split(query,".") | eval tld=mvindex(tlds,-1) | eval tld_len=len(tld) | search tld_len<=24 | eval query_length = len(query) | table host query query_length record_type count | eventstats stdev(query_length) AS stdev avg(query_length) AS avg p50(query_length) AS p50| where query_length>(avg+stdev*2) | eval z_score=(query_length-avg)/stdev | `dns_query_length_with_high_standard_deviation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
known_false_positives: It's possible there can be long domain names that are legitimate.
