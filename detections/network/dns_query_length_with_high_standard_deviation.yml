description: The following analytic identifies DNS queries with unusually large lengths
  by computing the standard deviation of query lengths and filtering those exceeding
  twice the standard deviation. It leverages DNS query data from the Network_Resolution
  data model, focusing on the length of the domain names being resolved. This activity
  is significant as unusually long DNS queries can indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control
  communication attempts. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to stealthily transfer data or maintain persistent communication channels within
  the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Resolution
  where NOT DNS.record_type IN("Pointer","PTR") by DNS.query host| `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")`
  | eval tlds=split(query,".") | eval tld=mvindex(tlds,-1) | eval tld_len=len(tld)
  | search tld_len<=24 | eval query_length = len(query) | table host query query_length
  record_type count | eventstats stdev(query_length) AS stdev avg(query_length) AS
  avg p50(query_length) AS p50| where query_length>(avg+stdev*2) | eval z_score=(query_length-avg)/stdev
  | `dns_query_length_with_high_standard_deviation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that
  DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
known_false_positives: It's possible there can be long domain names that are legitimate.
