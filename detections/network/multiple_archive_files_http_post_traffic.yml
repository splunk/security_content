description: This search is designed to detect high frequency of archive files data
  exfiltration through HTTP POST method protocol. This are one of the common techniques
  used by APT or trojan spy after doing the data collection like screenshot, recording,
  sensitive data to the infected machines. The attacker may execute archiving command
  to the collected data, save it a temp folder with a hidden attribute then send it
  to its C2 through HTTP POST. Sometimes adversaries will rename the archive files
  or encode/encrypt to cover their tracks. This detection can detect a renamed archive
  files transfer to HTTP POST since it checks the request body header. Unfortunately
  this detection cannot support archive that was encrypted or encoded before doing
  the exfiltration.
search: '`stream_http` http_method=POST |eval archive_hdr1=substr(form_data,1,2) |
  eval archive_hdr2 = substr(form_data,1,4) |stats values(form_data) as http_request_body
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by http_method http_user_agent
  uri_path url bytes_in bytes_out archive_hdr1 archive_hdr2 |where count >20 AND (archive_hdr1
  = "7z" OR archive_hdr1 = "PK" OR archive_hdr2="Rar!") | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `multiple_archive_files_http_post_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the stream HTTP logs or network logs that catch network traffic. Make
  sure that the http-request-body, payload, or request field is enabled in stream
  http configuration.
known_false_positives: Normal archive transfer via HTTP protocol may trip this detection.
