description: The following analytic detects the high-frequency exfiltration of archive
  files via HTTP POST requests. It leverages HTTP stream logs to identify specific
  archive file headers within the request body. This activity is significant as it
  often indicates data exfiltration by APTs or trojan spyware after data collection.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to the unauthorized transfer of
  sensitive data to an attacker’s command and control server, potentially resulting
  in severe data breaches and loss of confidential information.
data_source:
- Splunk Stream HTTP
search: '`stream_http` http_method=POST |eval archive_hdr1=substr(form_data,1,2) | eval archive_hdr2 = substr(form_data,1,4) |stats values(form_data) as http_request_body min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by src_ip dest_ip http_method http_user_agent uri_path url bytes_in bytes_out archive_hdr1 archive_hdr2 |where count >20 AND (archive_hdr1 = "7z" OR archive_hdr1 = "PK" OR archive_hdr2="Rar!") | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `multiple_archive_files_http_post_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the stream HTTP logs or network logs that catch network traffic. Make
  sure that the http-request-body, payload, or request field is enabled in stream
  http configuration.
known_false_positives: Normal archive transfer via HTTP protocol may trip this detection.
