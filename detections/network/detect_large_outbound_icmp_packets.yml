description: The following analytic identifies outbound ICMP packets with a size larger
  than 1,000 bytes. It leverages the Network_Traffic data model to detect unusually
  large ICMP packets that are not blocked and are destined for external IP addresses.
  This activity is significant because threat actors often use ICMP for command and
  control communication, and large ICMP packets can indicate data exfiltration or
  other malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to
  maintain covert communication channels, exfiltrate sensitive data, or further compromise
  the network.

how_to_implement: 'In order to run this search effectively, we highly recommend that
  you leverage the Assets and Identity framework. It is important that you have a
  good understanding of how your network segments are designed and that you are able
  to distinguish internal from external address space. Add a category named `internal`
  to the CIDRs that host the company''s assets in the `assets_by_cidr.csv` lookup
  file, which is located in `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-IdentityManagement/lookups/`.
  More information on updating this lookup can be found here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.0.0/Admin/Addassetandidentitydata.
  This search also requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating
  the Network_Traffic data model'
known_false_positives: ICMP packets are used in a variety of ways to help troubleshoot
  networking issues and ensure the proper flow of traffic. As such, it is possible
  that a large ICMP packet could be perfectly legitimate. If large ICMP packets are
  associated with Command And Control traffic, there will typically be a large number
  of these packets observed over time. If the search is providing a large number of
  false positives, you can modify the macro `detect_large_outbound_icmp_packets_filter`
  to adjust the byte threshold or add specific IP addresses to an allow list.
