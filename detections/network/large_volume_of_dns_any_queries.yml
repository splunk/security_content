description: The following analytic identifies a large volume of DNS ANY queries,
  which may indicate a DNS amplification attack. It leverages the Network_Resolution
  data model to count DNS queries of type "ANY" directed to specific destinations.
  This activity is significant because DNS amplification attacks can overwhelm network
  resources, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) conditions. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could disrupt services, degrade network performance, and potentially
  be part of a larger Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, impacting the availability
  of critical infrastructure.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Resolution
  where nodename=DNS "DNS.message_type"="QUERY" "DNS.record_type"="ANY" by "DNS.dest"
  | `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")` | where count>200 | `large_volume_of_dns_any_queries_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you must ensure that DNS data
  is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
known_false_positives: Legitimate ANY requests may trigger this search, however it
  is unusual to see a large volume of them under typical circumstances. You may modify
  the threshold in the search to better suit your environment.
