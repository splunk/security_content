description: This analytic detects internal hosts triggering multiple IDS signatures, which may include either
  more than 25 signatures against a single host or a single signature across over 25 destination IP addresses.
  Such patterns can indicate active vulnerability scanning activities within the network. By monitoring
  IDS logs, this detection helps identify and respond to potential vulnerability scanning attempts,
  enhancing the network's security posture and preventing potential exploits.

how_to_implement: For this detection to function effectively, it is essential to ingest IDS/IPS logs that are 
  mapped to the Common Information Model (CIM). These logs provide the necessary security-related telemetry 
  and contextual information needed to accurately identify and analyze potential threats. 
known_false_positives: Internal vulnerability scanners will trigger this detection.
