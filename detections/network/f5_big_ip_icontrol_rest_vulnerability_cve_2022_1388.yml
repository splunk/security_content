status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the F5 BIG-IP iControl
  REST API vulnerability (CVE-2022-1388) for unauthenticated remote code execution.
  It identifies suspicious URI paths and POST HTTP methods, along with specific request
  headers containing potential commands in the `utilcmdargs` field and a random base64
  encoded value in the `X-F5-Auth-Token` field. This activity is significant as it
  targets a critical vulnerability that can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands
  on the affected system. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise
  and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
data_source:
- Palo Alto Network Threat
search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.url="*/mgmt/tm/util/bash*" Web.http_method="POST"
  by Web.http_user_agent Web.http_method, Web.url,Web.url_length Web.src, Web.dest
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `f5_big_ip_icontrol_rest_vulnerability_cve_2022_1388_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  web or proxy logs, or ensure it is being filled by a proxy like device, into the
  Web Datamodel. For additional filtering, allow list private IP space or restrict
  by known good.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the activity is blocked or
  was not successful. Filter known vulnerablity scanners. Filter as needed.
