name: F5 BIG-IP iControl REST Vulnerability CVE-2022-1388
id: bb1c2c30-107a-4e56-a4b9-1f7022867bfe
version: 1
date: '2022-05-10'
author: Michael Haag, Splunk
status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies a recent unauthenticated remote code
  execution vulnerablity against the F5 BIG-IP iControl REST API. The analytic identifies
  the URI path found in the POCs and the HTTP Method of POST. In addition, the request
  header will have the commands that may be executed in fields utilcmdargs and the
  auth field of X-F5-Auth-Token, which may have a random base64 encoded value.
data_source: 
- Palo Alto Network Threat
search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.url="*/mgmt/tm/util/bash*" Web.http_method="POST"
  by Web.http_user_agent Web.http_method, Web.url,Web.url_length Web.src, Web.dest
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `f5_big_ip_icontrol_rest_vulnerability_cve_2022_1388_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  web or proxy logs, or ensure it is being filled by a proxy like device, into the
  Web Datamodel. For additional filtering, allow list private IP space or restrict
  by known good.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the activity is blocked or
  was not successful. Filter known vulnerablity scanners. Filter as needed.
