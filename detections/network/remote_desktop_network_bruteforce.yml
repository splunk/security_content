description: This search looks for RDP application network traffic and filters any
  source/destination pair generating more than twice the standard deviation of the
  average traffic.
how_to_implement: You must ensure that your network traffic data is populating the
  Network_Traffic data model.
id: a98727cc-286b-4ff2-b898-41df64695923
known_false_positives: RDP gateways may have unusually high amounts of traffic from
  all other hosts' RDP applications in the network.
