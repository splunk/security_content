description: The following analytic identifies potential Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
  brute force attacks by monitoring network traffic for RDP application activity.
  It detects anomalies by filtering source and destination pairs that generate traffic
  exceeding twice the standard deviation of the average traffic. This method leverages
  the Network_Traffic data model to identify unusual patterns indicative of brute
  force attempts. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attacker attempting
  to gain unauthorized access to systems via RDP. If confirmed malicious, this could
  lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further network compromise.

how_to_implement: You must ensure that your network traffic data is populating the
  Network_Traffic data model.
known_false_positives: RDP gateways may have unusually high amounts of traffic from
  all other hosts' RDP applications in the network.
