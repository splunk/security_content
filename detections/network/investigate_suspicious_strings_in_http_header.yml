description: This search helps an analyst investigate a notable event related to a
  potential Apache Struts exploitation. To investigate, we will want to isolate and
  analyze the "payload" or the commands that were passed to the vulnerable hosts by
  creating a few regular expressions to carve out the commands focusing on common
  keywords from the payload, such as cmd.exe, /bin/bash and whois. The search returns
  these suspicious strings found in the HTTP logs of the system of interest.
search: '`stream_http` | search src_ip=$src_ip$ | search dest_ip=$dest_ip$ | eval
  cs_content_type_length = len(cs_content_type) | search cs_content_type_length >
  100 | rex field="cs_content_type" (?<suspicious_strings>cmd.exe) | eval suspicious_strings_found=if(match(cs_content_type,
  "application"), "True", "False")  | rename suspicious_strings_found AS "Suspicious
  Content-Type Found" | fields "Suspicious Content-Type Found", dest_ip, src_ip, suspicious_strings,
  cs_content_type, cs_content_type_length, url'
how_to_implement: This particular search leverages data extracted from Stream:HTTP.
  You must configure the http stream using the Splunk Stream App on your Splunk Stream
  deployment server to extract the cs_content_type field.
