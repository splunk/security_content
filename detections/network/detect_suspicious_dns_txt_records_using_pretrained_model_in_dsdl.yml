description: The following analytic uses a pre trained deep learning model to detect
  suspicious DNS TXT records. The model is trained independently and is then made
  available for download. The DNS TXT records are categorized into commonly identified
  types like email, verification, http using regular expressions https://www.tide-project.nl/blog/wtmc2020/.
  The TXT records that do not match regular expressions for well known types are labeled
  as 1 for "unknown/suspicious" and otherwise 0 for "not suspicious". The deep learning
  model we have developed uses DNS TXT responses to analyze patterns of character
  sequences to predict if a DNS TXT is suspicious or not. The higher the pred_is_unknown_proba,
  the more likely the DNS TXT record is suspicious. The threshold for flagging a domain
  as suspicious is set at 0.5.

how_to_implement: 'Steps to deploy detect suspicious DNS TXT records model into Splunk
  App DSDL. This detection depends on the Splunk app for Data Science and Deep Learning
  which can be found here - `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4607/` and the Network
  Resolution datamodel which can be found here - `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/`.
  The detection uses a pre-trained deep learning model that needs to be deployed in
  DSDL app. Follow the steps for deployment here - `https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/How-to-deploy-pre-trained-Deep-Learning-models-for-ESCU`.

  * Download the `artifacts .tar.gz` file from the link - `https://seal.splunkresearch.com/detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz`.

  * Download the `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.ipynb`
  Jupyter notebook from `https://github.com/splunk/security_content/notebooks`.

  * Login to the Jupyter Lab assigned for  `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl`
  container. This container should be listed on Containers page for DSDL app.

  * Below steps need to be followed inside Jupyter lab.

  * Upload the `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz`
  file into `app/model/data` path using the upload option in the jupyter notebook.

  * Untar the artifact `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz`
  using `tar -xf app/model/data/detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz
  -C app/model/data`.

  * Upload detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.ipynb`
  into Jupyter lab notebooks folder using the upload option in Jupyter lab.

  * Save the notebook using the save option in Jupyter notebook.

  * Upload `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.json`
  into `notebooks/data` folder.'
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if DNS TXT record contents are
  similar to benign DNS TXT record contents.
