description: The following analytic identifies the use of cleartext protocols that
  risk leaking sensitive information. It detects network traffic on legacy protocols
  such as Telnet (port 23), POP3 (port 110), IMAP (port 143), and non-anonymous FTP
  (port 21). The detection leverages the Network_Traffic data model to identify TCP
  traffic on these ports. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can expose credentials
  and other sensitive data to interception. If confirmed malicious, attackers could
  capture authentication details, leading to unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.action!=blocked AND
  All_Traffic.transport="tcp" AND (All_Traffic.dest_port="23" OR All_Traffic.dest_port="143"
  OR All_Traffic.dest_port="110" OR (All_Traffic.dest_port="21" AND All_Traffic.user

  | `protocols_passing_authentication_in_cleartext_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic, and
  populating the Network_Traffic data model. For more accurate result it's better
  to limit destination to organization private and public IP range, like All_Traffic.dest
  IN(192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8, x.x.x.x/22)
known_false_positives: Some networks may use kerberized FTP or telnet servers, however,
  this is rare.
