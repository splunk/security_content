name: Zeek x509 Certificate with Punycode

status: experimental
type: Hunting
description: The following analytic utilizes the Zeek x509 log. Modify the zeek_x509
  macro with your index and sourcetype as needed. You will need to ensure the full
  x509 is logged as the potentially malicious punycode is nested under subject alternative
  names. In this particular analytic, it will identify punycode within the subject
  alternative name email and other fields. Note, that OtherFields is meant to be BOOL
  (true,false), therefore we may never see xn-- in that field. Upon identifying punycode,
  manually copy and paste, or add CyberChef recipe to query, and decode the punycode
  manually.

search: '`zeek_x509` | rex field=san.email{} "\@(?<domain_detected>xn--.*)" | rex
  field=san.other_fields{} "\@(?<domain_detected>xn--.*)" | stats values(domain_detected)
  by  basic_constraints.ca source host | `zeek_x509_certificate_with_punycode_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic requires x509 certificate data to be logged
  entirely. In particular, for CVE-2022-3602, the punycode will be within the leaf
  certificate. The analytic may be modified to look for all xn--, or utilize a network
  IDS/monitoring tool like Zeek or Suricata to drill down into cert captured. Note
  for Suricata, the certificate is base64 encoded and will need to be decoded to capture
  the punycode (punycode will need to be decoded after).
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization works with
  international businesses. Filter as needed.
