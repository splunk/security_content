name: Zeek x509 Certificate with Punycode
id: 029d6fe4-a5fe-43af-827e-c78c50e81d81

status: experimental
type: Hunting
description: The following analytic detects the presence of punycode within x509 certificates
  using Zeek x509 logs. It identifies punycode in the subject alternative name email
  and other fields by searching for the "xn--" prefix. This activity is significant
  as punycode can be used in phishing attacks or to bypass domain filters, posing
  a security risk. If confirmed malicious, attackers could use these certificates
  to impersonate legitimate domains, potentially leading to unauthorized access or
  data breaches.
data_source: []
search: '`zeek_x509` | rex field=san.email{} "\@(?<domain_detected>xn--.*)" | rex
  field=san.other_fields{} "\@(?<domain_detected>xn--.*)" | stats values(domain_detected)
  by  basic_constraints.ca source host | `zeek_x509_certificate_with_punycode_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic requires x509 certificate data to be logged
  entirely. In particular, for CVE-2022-3602, the punycode will be within the leaf
  certificate. The analytic may be modified to look for all xn--, or utilize a network
  IDS/monitoring tool like Zeek or Suricata to drill down into cert captured. Note
  for Suricata, the certificate is base64 encoded and will need to be decoded to capture
  the punycode (punycode will need to be decoded after).
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization works with
  international businesses. Filter as needed.
