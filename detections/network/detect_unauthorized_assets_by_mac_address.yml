description: The following analytic identifies unauthorized devices attempting to
  connect to the organization's network by inspecting DHCP request packets. It detects
  this activity by comparing the MAC addresses in DHCP requests against a list of
  known authorized devices stored in the assets_by_str lookup. This activity is
  significant for a SOC because unauthorized devices can pose security risks, including
  potential data breaches or network disruptions. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized network access, potentially leading
  to further exploitation or data exfiltration.

how_to_implement: This search uses the Network_Sessions data model shipped with Enterprise
  Security. It leverages the Assets and Identity framework to populate the assets_by_str
  lookup located in SA-IdentityManagement, which will contain a list of known authorized
  organizational assets including their MAC addresses. Ensure that all inventoried
  systems have their MAC address populated.
known_false_positives: This search might be prone to high false positives. Please
  consider this when conducting analysis or investigations. Authorized devices may
  be detected as unauthorized. If this is the case, verify the MAC address of the
  system responsible for the false positive and add it to the Assets and Identity
  framework with the proper information.
