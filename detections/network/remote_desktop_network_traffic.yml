description: The following analytic detects unusual Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
  traffic on TCP/3389 by filtering out known RDP sources and destinations, focusing
  on atypical connections within the network. This detection leverages network traffic
  data to identify potentially unauthorized RDP access. Monitoring this activity is
  crucial for a SOC as unauthorized RDP access can indicate an attacker's attempt
  to control networked systems, leading to data theft, ransomware deployment, or further
  network compromise. If confirmed malicious, this activity could result in significant
  data breaches or complete system and network control loss.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.dest_port=3389 AND
  All_Traffic.dest_category!=common_rdp_destination AND All_Traffic.src_category!=common_rdp_source
  AND All_Traffic.action="allowed" by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest All_Traffic.dest_port
  | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `remote_desktop_network_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to identify systems
  that commonly originate remote desktop traffic and that commonly receive remote
  desktop traffic. You can use the included support search "Identify Systems Creating
  Remote Desktop Traffic" to identify systems that originate the traffic and the search
  "Identify Systems Receiving Remote Desktop Traffic" to identify systems that receive
  a lot of remote desktop traffic. After identifying these systems, you will need
  to add the "common_rdp_source" or "common_rdp_destination" category to that system
  depending on the usage, using the Enterprise Security Assets and Identities framework.  This
  can be done by adding an entry in the assets.csv file located in SA-IdentityManagement/lookups.
known_false_positives: Remote Desktop may be used legitimately by users on the network.
