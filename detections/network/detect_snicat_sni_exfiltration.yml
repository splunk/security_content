type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies the use of SNICat tool commands within
  the TLS SNI field, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts. It leverages
  Zeek SSL data to detect specific SNICat commands such as LIST, LS, SIZE, LD, CB,
  EX, ALIVE, EXIT, WHERE, and finito in the server_name field. This activity is significant
  as SNICat is a known tool for covert data exfiltration using TLS. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data undetected, posing a severe
  threat to data confidentiality and integrity.
data_source: []
search: '`zeek_ssl` | rex field=server_name "(?<snicat>(LIST|LS|SIZE|LD|CB|CD|EX|ALIVE|EXIT|WHERE|finito)-[A-Za-z0-9]{16}\.)"
  | stats count by src_ip dest_ip server_name snicat | where count>0 | table src_ip
  dest_ip server_name snicat | `detect_snicat_sni_exfiltration_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Zeek SSL data into Splunk. Zeek data should
  also be getting ingested in JSON format.  We are detecting when any of the predefined
  SNICat commands are found within the server_name (SNI) field. These commands are
  LIST, LS, SIZE, LD, CB, EX, ALIVE, EXIT, WHERE, and finito.  You can go further
  once this has been detected, and run other searches to decode the SNI data to prove
  or disprove if any data exfiltration has taken place.
