description: This search looks for commands that the SNICat tool uses in the TLS SNI
  field.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Zeek SSL data into Splunk. Zeek data should
  also be getting ingested in JSON format.  We are detecting when any of the predefined
  SNICat commands are found within the server_name (SNI) field. These commands are
  LIST, LS, SIZE, LD, CB, EX, ALIVE, EXIT, WHERE, and finito.  You can go further
  once this has been detected, and run other searches to decode the SNI data to prove
  or disprove if any data exfiltration has taken place.
