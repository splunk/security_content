description: This search is used to detect DNS tunneling, by calculating the sum of
  the length of DNS queries and DNS answers. The search also filters out potential
  false positives by filtering out queries made to internal systems and the queries
  originating from internal DNS, Web, and Email servers. Endpoints using DNS as a
  method of transmission for data exfiltration, command and control, or evasion of
  security controls can often be detected by noting an unusually large volume of DNS
  traffic.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, we must ensure that DNS data
  is being ingested and mapped to the appropriate fields in the Network_Resolution
  data model. Fields like src_category are automatically provided by the Assets and
  Identity Framework shipped with Splunk Enterprise Security. You will need to ensure
  you are using the Assets and Identity Framework and populating the src_category
  field. You will also need to enable the `cim_corporate_web_domain_search()` macro
  which will essentially filter out the DNS queries made to the corporate web domains
  to reduce alert fatigue.

known_false_positives: It's possible that normal DNS traffic will exhibit this behavior.
  If an alert is generated, please investigate and validate as appropriate. The threshold
  can also be modified to better suit your environment.
