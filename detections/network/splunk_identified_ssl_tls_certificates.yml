type: Hunting
description: The following analytic uses tags of SSL, TLS and certificate to identify
  the usage of the Splunk default certificates being utilized in the environment.
  Recommended guidance is to utilize valid TLS certificates which documentation may
  be found in Splunk Docs - https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.6/Security/AboutsecuringyourSplunkconfigurationwithSSL.
data_source: []
search: tag IN (ssl, tls, certificate) ssl_issuer_common_name=*splunk* | stats values(src)
  AS "Host(s) with Default Cert" count by ssl_issuer ssl_subject_common_name ssl_subject_organization
  ssl_subject host sourcetype | `splunk_identified_ssl_tls_certificates_filter`
how_to_implement: Ingestion of SSL/TLS data is needed and to be tagged properly as
  ssl, tls or certificate. This data may come from a proxy, zeek, or Splunk Streams.
  Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook that walks an analyst through the
  process of running these hunting searches in the references list of this detection.
  In order to use this workbook, a user will need to run a curl command to post the
  file to their SOAR instance such as "curl -u username:password https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template
  -d @splunk_psa_0622.json". A user should then create an empty container or case,
  attach the workbook, and begin working through the tasks.
known_false_positives: False positives will not be present as it is meant to assist
  with identifying default certificates being utilized.
