description: The following analytic detects DNS queries to common Ngrok domains, indicating
  potential use of the Ngrok reverse proxy tool. It leverages the Network Resolution
  datamodel to identify queries to domains such as "*.ngrok.com" and "*.ngrok.io".
  While Ngrok usage is not inherently malicious, it has been increasingly adopted
  by adversaries for covert communication and data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow attackers to bypass network defenses, establish persistent
  connections, and exfiltrate sensitive data, posing a significant threat to the network's
  security.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Network_Resolution where DNS.query IN ("*.ngrok.com","*.ngrok.io",
  "ngrok.*.tunnel.com", "korgn.*.lennut.com") by DNS.src DNS.query DNS.answer |  `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ngrok_reverse_proxy_on_network_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Network Resolution Datamodel will need to have data mapped to
  it regarding DNS queries. Modify query as needed to use another source.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on organizations that
  allow the use of Ngrok. Filter or monitor as needed.
