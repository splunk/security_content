- Network_Resolution
description: The following analytic identifies the 4 most common Ngrok used domains based on DNS queries under the Network Resolution datamodel. 
  It's possible these domains may be ran against the Web datamodel or ran with a direct query across network/proxy traffic. 
  The sign of someone using Ngrok is not malicious, however, more recenctly it has become an adversary tool.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Network_Resolution where DNS.query IN ("*.ngrok.com","*.ngrok.io", "ngrok.*.tunnel.com", "korgn.*.lennut.com")
  by DNS.src DNS.query DNS.answer
  |  `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `ngrok_reverse_proxy_on_network_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Network Resolution Datamodel will need to have data mapped to it regarding DNS queries. Modify query as needed to use another source.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on organizations that allow the use of Ngrok. Filter or monitor as needed.
