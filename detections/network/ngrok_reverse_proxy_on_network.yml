description: The following analytic identifies the 4 most common Ngrok used domains
  based on DNS queries under the Network Resolution datamodel. It's possible these
  domains may be ran against the Web datamodel or ran with a direct query across network/proxy
  traffic. The sign of someone using Ngrok is not malicious, however, more recenctly
  it has become an adversary tool.
data_source: 
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Network_Resolution where DNS.query IN ("*.ngrok.com","*.ngrok.io",
  "ngrok.*.tunnel.com", "korgn.*.lennut.com") by DNS.src DNS.query DNS.answer |  `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ngrok_reverse_proxy_on_network_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Network Resolution Datamodel will need to have data mapped to
  it regarding DNS queries. Modify query as needed to use another source.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on organizations that
  allow the use of Ngrok. Filter or monitor as needed.
