description: This search detects Zerologon attempts via Zeek DCE-RPC data.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Zeek DCE-RPC data into Splunk.
  Zeek data should also be getting ingested in JSON format.  We are detecting
  when all three RPC operations (NetrServerReqChallenge, NetrServerAuthenticate3, NetrServerPasswordSet2) are splunk_security_essentials_app
  via bro:rpc:json.  These three operations are then correlated on the Zeek UID field.
