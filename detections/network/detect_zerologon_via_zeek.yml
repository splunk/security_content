description: This search detects attempts to run exploits for the Zerologon CVE-2020-1472
  vulnerability via Zeek RPC
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Zeek DCE-RPC data into Splunk. Zeek data should
  also be getting ingested in JSON format.  We are detecting when all three RPC operations
  (NetrServerReqChallenge, NetrServerAuthenticate3, NetrServerPasswordSet2) are splunk_security_essentials_app
  via bro:rpc:json.  These three operations are then correlated on the Zeek UID field.
