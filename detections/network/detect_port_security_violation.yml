description: By enabling Port Security on a Cisco switch you can restrict input to
  an interface by limiting and identifying MAC addresses of the workstations that
  are allowed to access the port. When you assign secure MAC addresses to a secure
  port, the port does not forward packets with source addresses outside the group
  of defined addresses. If you limit the number of secure MAC addresses to one and
  assign a single secure MAC address, the workstation attached to that port is assured
  the full bandwidth of the port. If a port is configured as a secure port and the
  maximum number of secure MAC addresses is reached, when the MAC address of a workstation
  attempting to access the port is different from any of the identified secure MAC
  addresses, a security violation occurs.
search: '`cisco_networks` (facility="PM" mnemonic="ERR_DISABLE" disable_cause="psecure-violation")
  OR (facility="PORT_SECURITY" mnemonic="PSECURE_VIOLATION" OR mnemonic="PSECURE_VIOLATION_VLAN")
  | eval src_interface=src_int_prefix_long+src_int_suffix | stats min(_time) AS firstTime
  max(_time) AS lastTime values(disable_cause) AS disable_cause values(src_mac) AS
  src_mac values(src_vlan) AS src_vlan values(action) AS action count by host src_interface
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_port_security_violation_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must be configured with Port Security and Error Disable
  for this to work (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12-2/25ew/configuration/guide/conf/port_sec.html)
  and log with a severity level of minimum "5 - notification". The search also requires
  that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)
  is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.
known_false_positives: This search might be prone to high false positives if you have
  malfunctioning devices connected to your ethernet ports or if end users periodically
  connect physical devices to the network.
