description: The following analytic detects port security violations on Cisco switches.
  It leverages logs from Cisco network devices, specifically looking for events with
  mnemonics indicating port security violations. This activity is significant because
  it indicates an unauthorized device attempting to connect to a secured port, potentially
  bypassing network access controls. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to gain unauthorized access to the network, leading to data exfiltration, network
  disruption, or further lateral movement within the environment.

how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must be configured with Port Security and Error Disable
  for this to work (see 
  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12-2/25ew/configuration/guide/conf/port_sec.html)
  and log with a severity level of minimum "5 - notification". The search also requires
  that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)
  is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.
known_false_positives: This search might be prone to high false positives if you have
  malfunctioning devices connected to your ethernet ports or if end users periodically
  connect physical devices to the network.
