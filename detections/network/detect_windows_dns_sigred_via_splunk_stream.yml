name: Detect Windows DNS SIGRed via Splunk Stream

description: "The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the SIGRed vulnerability
  (CVE-2020-1350) in Windows DNS servers. It leverages Splunk Stream DNS and TCP data
  to identify DNS SIG and KEY records, as well as TCP payloads exceeding 65KB. This
  activity is significant because SIGRed is a critical wormable vulnerability that
  allows remote code execution. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized
  access, execute arbitrary code, and potentially disrupt services, leading to severe
  data breaches and infrastructure compromise. Immediate investigation and remediation
  are crucial to mitigate these risks."

search: '`stream_dns` | spath "query_type{}" | search "query_type{}" IN (SIG,KEY)
  | spath protocol_stack | search protocol_stack="ip:tcp:dns" | append [search `stream_tcp`
  bytes_out>65000] | `detect_windows_dns_sigred_via_splunk_stream_filter` | stats
  count by flow_id | where count>1 | fields - count'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Splunk Stream DNS and Splunk Stream TCP. We
  are detecting SIG and KEY records via stream:dns and TCP payload over 65KB in size
  via stream:tcp.  Replace the macro definitions ('stream:dns' and 'stream:tcp') with
  configurations for your Splunk environment.
