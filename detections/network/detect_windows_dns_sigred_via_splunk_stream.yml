name: Detect Windows DNS SIGRed via Splunk Stream

status: experimental
type: TTP
description: "Ensure that the following prerequisites are met: (i) Both Splunk Stream DNS and TCP data are ingested. (ii) The macros 'stream:dns' and 'stream:tcp' are replaced with the appropriate configurations that are specific to your Splunk environment. The following analytic detects SIGRed exploitation attempts. SIGRed is a critical wormable vulnerability found in Windows DNS servers, known as CVE-2020-1350, which allows remote code execution. The detection is made by using an experimental search that focuses on identifying specific indicators that might suggest the presence of the SIGRed exploit such as DNS SIG records, KEY records, and TCP payloads greater than 65KB. This detection is important because it detects and responds to potential SIGRed exploitation attempts and minimizes the risk of a successful attack and its impact on the organization's infrastructure and data. False positives might occur due to the experimental nature of this analytic. Next steps include reviewing and investigating each case thoroughly given the potential for unauthorized Windows DNS server access, data breaches, and service disruptions. Additionally, you must stay updated with Microsoft's guidance on the SIGRed vulnerability."

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Splunk Stream DNS and Splunk Stream TCP. We
  are detecting SIG and KEY records via stream:dns and TCP payload over 65KB in size
  via stream:tcp.  Replace the macro definitions ('stream:dns' and 'stream:tcp') with
  configurations for your Splunk environment.
