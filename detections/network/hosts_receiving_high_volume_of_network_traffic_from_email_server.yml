description: The following analytic identifies hosts receiving an unusually high volume of network traffic from an email server. It leverages the Network_Traffic data model to sum incoming bytes to clients from email servers, comparing current traffic against historical averages and standard deviations. This activity is significant as it may indicate data exfiltration by a malicious actor using the email server. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized data access and potential data breaches, compromising sensitive information and impacting organizational security.

how_to_implement: This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.  Your email servers must be categorized as "email_server" for the search to work, as well. You may need to adjust the deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples values based on the network traffic in your environment. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.
known_false_positives: The false-positive rate will vary based on how you set the deviation_threshold and data_samples values. Our recommendation is to adjust these values based on your network traffic to and from your email servers.
