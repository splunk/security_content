description: The following analytic detects ARP Poisoning attacks by monitoring for
  Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) errors on Cisco network devices. It leverages logs
  from Cisco devices, specifically looking for events where the ARP inspection feature
  has disabled an interface due to suspicious activity. This activity is significant
  because ARP Poisoning can allow attackers to intercept, modify, or disrupt network
  traffic, leading to potential data breaches or denial of service. If confirmed malicious,
  this could enable attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising the
  integrity and confidentiality of network communications.

how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must be configured with DHCP Snooping (see 
  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-0_2_EX/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg_chapter_01101.html)
  and Dynamic ARP Inspection (see 
  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-2_2_e/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg_chapter_01111.html)
  and log with a severity level of minimum "5 - notification". The search also requires
  that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)
  is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.
known_false_positives: This search might be prone to high false positives if DHCP
  Snooping or ARP inspection has been incorrectly configured, or if a device normally
  sends many ARP packets (unlikely).
