description: The following analytic detects network traffic associated with known
  remote access software applications, such as AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, and TeamViewer.
  It leverages Palo Alto traffic logs mapped to the Network_Traffic data model in
  Splunk. This activity is significant because adversaries often use remote access
  tools to maintain unauthorized access to compromised environments. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow attackers to control systems remotely, exfiltrate
  data, or deploy additional malware, posing a severe threat to the organization's
  security.
data_source:
- Palo Alto Network Traffic
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(All_Traffic.dest_port) as dest_port latest(user) as user from
  datamodel=Network_Traffic by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest, All_Traffic.app |
  `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | lookup remote_access_software remote_appid AS app OUTPUT isutility, description
  as signature, comment_reference as desc, category | search isutility = True | `remote_access_software_usage_exceptions` | `detect_remote_access_software_usage_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic was developed with Palo Alto traffic logs.
  Ensure that the logs are being ingested into Splunk and mapped to the Network_Traffic
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process. The "exceptions" macro leverages 
  both an Assets and Identities lookup, as well as a KVStore collection called 
  "remote_software_exceptions" that lets you track and maintain device-
  based exceptions for this set of detections.
known_false_positives: It is possible that legitimate remote access software is used
  within the environment. Ensure that the lookup is reviewed and updated with any
  additional remote access software that is used within the environment.
  Known false positives can be added to the remote_access_software_usage_exception 
  lookup to globally suppress these situations across all remote access content
