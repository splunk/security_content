description: The following analytic detects when a known remote access software application traffic is detected from within the environment. Adversaries use these utilities to retain remote access capabilities to the environment. Utilities in the lookup include AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, TeamViewer and much more. Review the lookup for the entire list and add any others.
data_source: 
- Palo Alto Network Traffic
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(All_Traffic.dest_port) as dest_port latest(user) as user from datamodel=Network_Traffic by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest, All_Traffic.app
  | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | lookup remote_access_software remote_appid AS app OUTPUT isutility, description as signature, comment_reference as desc, category
  | search isutility = True
  | `detect_remote_access_software_usage_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic was developed with Palo Alto traffic logs. Ensure that the logs are being ingested into Splunk and mapped to the Network_Traffic data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible that legitimate remote access software is used within the environment. Ensure that the lookup is reviewed and updated with any additional remote access software that is used within the environment.
