description: The following analytic detects network traffic associated with known remote access software applications, such as AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, and TeamViewer. It leverages Palo Alto traffic logs mapped to the Network_Traffic data model in Splunk. This activity is significant because adversaries often use remote access tools to maintain unauthorized access to compromised environments. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to control systems remotely, exfiltrate data, or deploy additional malware, posing a severe threat to the organization's security.
data_source:
- Palo Alto Network Traffic
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(All_Traffic.dest_port) as dest_port latest(user) as user from datamodel=Network_Traffic by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest, All_Traffic.app | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | lookup remote_access_software remote_appid AS app OUTPUT isutility, description as signature, comment_reference as desc, category | search isutility = True | `remote_access_software_usage_exceptions` | `detect_remote_access_software_usage_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic was developed with Palo Alto traffic logs. Ensure that the logs are being ingested into Splunk and mapped to the Network_Traffic data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process. The "exceptions" macro leverages both an Assets and Identities lookup, as well as a KVStore collection called "remote_software_exceptions" that lets you track and maintain device- based exceptions for this set of detections.
known_false_positives: It is possible that legitimate remote access software is used within the environment. Ensure that the lookup is reviewed and updated with any additional remote access software that is used within the environment. Known false positives can be added to the remote_access_software_usage_exception.csv lookup to globally suppress these situations across all remote access content
