description: This search looks for network traffic on common ports where a higher
  layer protocol does not match the port that is being used. For example, this search
  should identify cases where protocols other than HTTP are running on TCP port 80.
  This can be used by attackers to circumvent firewall restrictions, or as an attempt
  to hide malicious communications over ports and protocols that are typically allowed
  and not well inspected.
how_to_implement: Running this search properly requires a technology that can inspect
  network traffic and identify common protocols. Technologies such as Bro and Palo
  Alto Networks firewalls are two examples that will identify protocols via inspection,
  and not just assume a specific protocol based on the transport protocol and ports.
