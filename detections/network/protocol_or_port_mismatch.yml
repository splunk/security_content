description: The following analytic identifies network traffic where the higher layer
  protocol does not match the expected port, such as non-HTTP traffic on TCP port
  80. It leverages data from network traffic inspection technologies like Bro or Palo
  Alto Networks firewalls. This activity is significant because it may indicate attempts
  to bypass firewall restrictions or conceal malicious communications. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to evade detection, maintain persistence,
  or exfiltrate data through commonly allowed ports, posing a significant threat to
  network security.

how_to_implement: Running this search properly requires a technology that can inspect
  network traffic and identify common protocols. Technologies such as Bro and Palo
  Alto Networks firewalls are two examples that will identify protocols via inspection,
  and not just assume a specific protocol based on the transport protocol and ports.
