description: This search looks for network traffic on TCP/3389, the default port used
  by remote desktop. While remote desktop traffic is not uncommon on a network, it
  is usually associated with known hosts. This search allows for whitelisting both
  source and destination hosts to remove them from the output of the search so you
  can focus on the uncommon uses of remote desktop on your network.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to identify systems
  that commonly originate remote desktop traffic and that commonly receive remote
  desktop traffic. You can use the included support search "Identify Systems Creating
  Remote Desktop Traffic" to identify systems that originate the traffic and the search
  "Identify Systems Receiving Remote Desktop Traffic" to identify systems that receive
  a lot of remote desktop traffic. After identifying these systems, you will need
  to add the "common_rdp_source" or "common_rdp_destination" category to that system
  depending on the usage, using the Enterprise Security Assets and Identities framework.  This
  can be done by adding an entry in the assets.csv file located in SA-IdentityManagement/lookups.
