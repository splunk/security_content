Creates a conditional statement that is always false (both because we don't want these values to exit the search pipeline and because we think we're clever).The second pipeline adds the **firstTime** and **lastTime** entries to search results. Next, it filters out any account pairs that haven't been seen for the first time within the last hour. The `isnotnull(_time)` will remove the entries from the cache file.\\\nThe search finishes by gathering the data that it will display to the user.",
