search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Resolution
  where nodename=DNS "DNS.message_type"="QUERY" "DNS.record_type"="ANY" by "DNS.dest"
  | `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")` | where count>200 | `large_volume_of_dns_any_queries_filter`'
known_false_positives: Legitimate ANY requests may trigger this search, however it
  is unusual to see a large volume of them under typical circumstances. You may modify
  the threshold in the search to better suit your environment.
