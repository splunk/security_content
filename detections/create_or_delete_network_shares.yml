eli5: In this search, we are looking for the command-line execution of net.exe with
  command-line parameters such as `net`, `share`, or `delete` that may correspond to
  the creation/deletion of windows drive shares. Net.exe is a built-in command-line tool
  on Windows that can be used to create, delete, and manage shared resources on the computer,
  both locally and remotely. Though this tool is used by Microsoft administrators to manage the network shares,
  attackers also leverage it to create and delete (hidden) file shares by appending
  "$" after the name of the share. Since the creation/deletion of hidden shares is a
  special case of detecting share creation/deletion we have commented out
  the regex that adds the additional matching criteria that will return only events that
  have creation/deletion associated to hidden shares. To look for hidden shares, use a
  regular expression to look for a `(name_file_share)$`.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
