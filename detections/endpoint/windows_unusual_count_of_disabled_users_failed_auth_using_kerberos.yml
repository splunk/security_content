description: 'The following analytic identifies a source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with multiple disabled domain users using the Kerberos protocol. It leverages EventCode
  4768, which is generated when the Key Distribution Center issues a Kerberos Ticket
  Granting Ticket (TGT) and detects failure code `0x12` (credentials revoked). This
  behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying attack targeting
  disabled accounts, potentially leading to initial access or privilege escalation.
  If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized access or elevate privileges
  within the Active Directory environment.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple disabled domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, multi-user systems missconfigured
  systems.
