description: This analytic detects a potential usage of secretsdump.py tool for dumping
  credentials (ntlm hash) from a copy of ntds.dit and SAM.Security,SYSTEM registrry
  hive. This technique was seen in some attacker that dump ntlm hashes offline after
  having a copy of ntds.dit and SAM/SYSTEM/SECURITY registry hive.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
