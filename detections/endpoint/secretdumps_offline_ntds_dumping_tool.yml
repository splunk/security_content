description: The following analytic detects the potential use of the secretsdump.py
  tool to dump NTLM hashes from a copy of ntds.dit and the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY
  registry hives. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on specific command-line patterns and process names associated with secretsdump.py.
  This activity is significant because it indicates an attempt to extract sensitive
  credential information offline, which is a common post-exploitation technique. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to obtain NTLM hashes, facilitating
  further lateral movement and potential privilege escalation within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
