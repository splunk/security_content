description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that disable Windows Defender Signature Retirement. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
  data model, specifically monitoring changes to the DisableSignatureRetirement registry
  setting. This activity is significant because disabling signature retirement can
  prevent Windows Defender from removing outdated antivirus signatures, potentially
  reducing its effectiveness in detecting threats. If confirmed malicious, this action
  could allow an attacker to evade detection by using older, less relevant signatures,
  thereby compromising the system's security posture.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\NIS\\Consumers\\IPS\\DisableSignatureRetirement" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001"
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_disable_win_defender_signature_retirement_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
