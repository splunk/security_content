description: The following analytic identifies a renamed instance of hh.exe (HTML
  Help) executing a Compiled HTML Help (CHM). This particular technique will load
  Windows script code from a compiled help file. CHM files may contain nearly any
  file type embedded, but only execute html/htm. Upon a successful execution, the
  following script engines may be used for execution - JScript, VBScript, VBScript.Encode,
  JScript.Encode, JScript.Compact. Analyst may identify vbscript.dll or jscript.dll
  loading into hh.exe upon execution. The "htm" and "html" file extensions were the
  only extensions observed to be supported for the execution of Shortcut commands
  or WSH script code. During investigation, identify script content origination. Validate
  it is the legitimate version of hh.exe by reviewing the PE metadata. hh.exe is natively
  found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_hh` by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_html_help_renamed_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely a renamed instance of hh.exe will be used
  legitimately, filter as needed.
