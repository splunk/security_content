description: The following analytic identifies a renamed instance of hh.exe (HTML
  Help) executing a Compiled HTML Help (CHM). This particular technique will load
  Windows script code from a compiled help file. CHM files may contain nearly any
  file type embedded, but only execute html/htm. Upon a successful execution, the
  following script engines may be used for execution - JScript, VBScript, VBScript.Encode,
  JScript.Encode, JScript.Compact. Analyst may identify vbscript.dll or jscript.dll
  loading into hh.exe upon execution. The "htm" and "html" file extensions were the
  only extensions observed to be supported for the execution of Shortcut commands
  or WSH script code. During investigation, identify script content origination. Validate
  it is the legitimate version of hh.exe by reviewing the PE metadata. hh.exe is natively
  found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name!=hh.exe
  AND Processes.original_file_name=HH.EXE by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_html_help_renamed_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely a renamed instance of hh.exe will be used
  legitimately, filter as needed.
