description: 'The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the command
  sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs will output
  to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable on critical endpoints or all.
  \

  This analytic identifies `copy` or `[System.IO.File]::Copy` being used to capture
  the SAM, SYSTEM or SECURITY hives identified in script block. This will catch the
  most basic use cases for credentials being taken for offline cracking. \

  During triage, review parallel processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It
  will be important to understand the timeline of events around this activity. Review
  the entire logged PowerShell script block.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives as the scope is limited to SAM, SYSTEM
  and SECURITY hives.
