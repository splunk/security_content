description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments that utilize the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet and the `Win32_UserAccount`
  parameter to query local user accounts. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt by adversaries to enumerate
  user accounts for situational awareness or Active Directory discovery. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to further reconnaissance, privilege escalation,
  or lateral movement within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="powershell.exe")
  (Processes.process=*Get-WmiObject* AND Processes.process=*Win32_UserAccount*) by
  Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `getwmiobject_user_account_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this PowerShell commandlet
  for troubleshooting.
