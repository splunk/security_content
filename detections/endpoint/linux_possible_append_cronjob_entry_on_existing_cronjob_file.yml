description: 'The following analytic detects potential tampering with cronjob files
  on a Linux system by identifying ''echo'' commands that append code to existing
  cronjob files. It leverages logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line executions. This activity
  is significant because adversaries often use it for persistence or privilege escalation.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute unauthorized code
  automatically, leading to system compromises and unauthorized data access, thereby
  impacting business operations and data integrity.'
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process = "*echo*" AND Processes.process IN("*/etc/cron*", "*/var/spool/cron/*",
  "*/etc/anacrontab*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_possible_append_cronjob_entry_on_existing_cronjob_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may arise from legitimate actions by administrators
  or network operators who may use these commands for automation purposes. Therefore,
  it's recommended to adjust filter macros to eliminate such false positives.
