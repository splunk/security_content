status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious DLL modules loaded by calc.exe
  that are not in windows %systemroot%\system32 or %systemroot%\sysWoW64 folder. This
  technique is well used by Qakbot malware to execute its malicious DLL file via dll
  side loading technique in calc process execution. This TTP detection is a good indicator
  that a suspicious dll was loaded in a public or non-common installation folder of
  Windows Operating System that needs further investigation.
data_source:

search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 Image = "*\calc.exe" AND NOT (Image IN ("*:\\windows\\system32\\*",
  "*:\\windows\\sysWow64\\*")) AND NOT(ImageLoaded IN("*:\\windows\\system32\\*",
  "*:\\windows\\sysWow64\\*", "*:\\windows\\WinSXS\\*")) | stats count min(_time)

  process_name dest EventCode Signed ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_dll_side_loading_in_calc_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on processes that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem`
  node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the
  latest TA for the endpoint product.
