description: The following analytic detects suspicious DLL modules loaded by calc.exe that are not located in the %systemroot%\system32 or %systemroot%\sysWoW64 directories. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify DLL side-loading, a technique often used by Qakbot malware to execute malicious DLLs. This activity is significant as it indicates potential malware execution through a trusted process, which can bypass security controls. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, maintain persistence, and escalate privileges within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 Image = "*\calc.exe" AND NOT (Image IN ("*:\\windows\\system32\\*", "*:\\windows\\sysWow64\\*")) AND NOT(ImageLoaded IN("*:\\windows\\system32\\*", "*:\\windows\\sysWow64\\*", "*:\\windows\\WinSXS\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded OriginalFileName Product process_name dest EventCode Signed ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_dll_side_loading_in_calc_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on processes that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
