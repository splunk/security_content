description: The following analytic identifies the use of suspicious command-line
  parameters associated with Impacket tools, such as `wmiexec.py`, `smbexec.py`, `dcomexec.py`,
  and `atexec.py`, which are used for lateral movement and remote code execution.
  It detects these activities by analyzing process execution logs from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line patterns. This activity
  is significant because Impacket tools are commonly used by adversaries and Red Teams
  to move laterally within a network. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to execute commands remotely, potentially leading to further compromise and data
  exfiltration.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=cmd.exe
  (Processes.process = "*/Q /c * \\\\127.0.0.1\\*$*" AND Processes.process IN ("*2>&1*","*2&gt;&amp;1*"))
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `impacket_lateral_movement_commandline_parameters_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although uncommon, Administrators may leverage Impackets tools
  to start a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use
  cases.
