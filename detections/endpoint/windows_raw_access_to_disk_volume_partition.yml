description: This analytic is to look for suspicious raw access read to device disk partition of the host machine.
  This technique was seen in several attacks by adversaries or threat actor to wipe, encrypt or overwrite the boot sector of each partition  
  as part of their impact payload for example the "hermeticwiper" malware. 
  This detection is a good indicator that there is a process try to read or write on boot sector.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=9 Device = \\Device\\HarddiskVolume* NOT (Image IN("*\\Windows\\System32\\*", "*\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\*")) 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image Device ProcessGuid ProcessId EventDescription EventCode Computer 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_raw_access_to_disk_volume_partition_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the raw access read event (like sysmon eventcode 9), process name and process guid from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: This event is really notable but we found minimal number of normal application from system32 folder like 
  svchost.exe accessing it too. In this case we used 'system32' and 'syswow64' path as a filter for this detection.
