description: This analytic is to look for suspicious raw access read to device disk
  partition of the host machine. This technique was seen in several attacks by adversaries
  or threat actor to wipe, encrypt or overwrite the boot sector of each partition
  as part of their impact payload for example the "hermeticwiper" malware. This detection
  is a good indicator that there is a process try to read or write on boot sector.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 9
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=9 Device = \\Device\\HarddiskVolume* NOT (Image IN("*\\Windows\\System32\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by dest signature signature_id process_guid process_name process_path Device | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_raw_access_to_disk_volume_partition_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the raw access read event (like sysmon eventcode 9), process name and
  process guid from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: This event is really notable but we found minimal number of
  normal application from system32 folder like svchost.exe accessing it too. In this
  case we used 'system32' and 'syswow64' path as a filter for this detection.
