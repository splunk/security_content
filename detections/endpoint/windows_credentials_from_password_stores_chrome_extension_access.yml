- Windows Event Log Security 4663
description: The following analytic detects non-Chrome processes attempting to access
  the Chrome extensions file. It leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically
  event code 4663, to identify this behavior. This activity is significant because
  adversaries may exploit this file to extract sensitive information from the Chrome
  browser, posing a security risk. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  access to stored credentials and other sensitive data, potentially compromising
  the security of the affected system and broader network.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 object_file_path="*\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User
  Data\\Default\\Local Extension Settings\\*" AND NOT (process_path IN ("*:\\Windows\\explorer.exe",
  "*\\chrome.exe")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by
  object_file_name object_file_path process_name process_path  process_id EventCode
  dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_credentials_from_password_stores_chrome_extension_access_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Uninstall chrome browser extension application may access this
  file and folder path to removed chrome installation in the target host. Filter is
  needed.
