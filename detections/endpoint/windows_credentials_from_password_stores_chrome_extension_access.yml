description: This analytic focuses on identifying non-chrome processes that attempt to access the Chrome extensions file. 
  This file contains crucial settings and information related to the browser's extensions installed on the computer. 
  Adversaries and malware authors have been known to exploit this file to extract sensitive information from the Chrome browser on targeted hosts. 
  Detecting such anomalous behavior provides valuable insights for analyzing suspicious processes beyond the commonly observed chrome.exe and explorer.exe executables. 
  By monitoring for access to the Chrome extensions file by non-chrome processes, we can enhance our ability to detect potential threats and protect sensitive information stored within the browser.

how_to_implement:  To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Uninstall chrome browser extension application may access this file and folder path to removed chrome installation in the target host. Filter is needed.
