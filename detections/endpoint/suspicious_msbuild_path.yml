description: The following analytic identifies msbuild.exe executing from a non-standard
  path. Msbuild.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319
  and C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319. Instances of Visual Studio
  will run a copy of msbuild.exe. A moved instance of MSBuild is suspicious, however
  there are instances of build applications that will move or use a copy of MSBuild.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_msbuild`
  AND (Processes.process_path!=c:\\windows\\microsoft.net\\framework*\\v*\\*) by Processes.dest Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `suspicious_msbuild_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications may use a moved copy of msbuild.exe,
  triggering a false positive. Baselining of MSBuild.exe usage is recommended to better
  understand it's path usage. Visual Studio runs an instance out of a path that will
  need to be filtered on.
