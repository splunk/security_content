description: The following analytic detects the execution of msbuild.exe from a non-standard
  path. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process execution logs that deviate from typical msbuild.exe locations. This
  activity is significant because msbuild.exe is commonly abused by attackers to execute
  malicious code, and running it from an unusual path can indicate an attempt to evade
  detection. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to execute
  arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise and further malicious activities.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications may use a moved copy of msbuild.exe,
  triggering a false positive. Baselining of MSBuild.exe usage is recommended to better
  understand it's path usage. Visual Studio runs an instance out of a path that will
  need to be filtered on.
