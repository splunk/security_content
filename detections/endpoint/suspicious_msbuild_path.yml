description: The following analytic identifies msbuild.exe executing from a non-standard
  path. Msbuild.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319
  and C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319. Instances of Visual Studio
  will run a copy of msbuild.exe. A moved instance of MSBuild is suspicious, however
  there are instances of build applications that will move or use a copy of MSBuild.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications may use a moved copy of msbuild.exe,
  triggering a false positive. Baselining of MSBuild.exe usage is recommended to better
  understand it's path usage. Visual Studio runs an instance out of a path that will
  need to be filtered on.
