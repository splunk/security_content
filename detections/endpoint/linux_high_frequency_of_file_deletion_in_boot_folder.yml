name: Linux High Frequency Of File Deletion In Boot Folder

type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects a high frequency of file deletions in
  the /boot/ folder on Linux systems. It leverages filesystem event logs to identify
  when 200 or more files are deleted within an hour by the same process. This behavior
  is significant as it may indicate the presence of wiper malware, such as Industroyer2,
  which targets critical system directories. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could lead to system instability or failure, hindering the boot process and potentially
  causing a complete system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Filesystem.file_name) as
  deletedFileNames values(Filesystem.file_path) as deletedFilePath dc(Filesystem.file_path)
  as numOfDelFilePath count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where Filesystem.action=deleted Filesystem.file_path = "/boot/*" by _time span=1h  Filesystem.dest
  Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.action | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` |
  where  numOfDelFilePath >= 200 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_high_frequency_of_file_deletion_in_boot_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: linux package installer/uninstaller may cause this event. Please
  update you filter macro to remove false positives.
