name: Linux High Frequency Of File Deletion In Boot Folder

description: The following analytic detects a high frequency of file deletions in the /boot/ folder on Linux systems. It leverages filesystem event logs to identify when 200 or more files are deleted within an hour by the same process. This behavior is significant as it may indicate the presence of wiper malware, such as Industroyer2, which targets critical system directories. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to system instability or failure, hindering the boot process and potentially causing a complete system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Filesystem.file_name) as deletedFileNames values(Filesystem.file_path) as deletedFilePath dc(Filesystem.file_path) as numOfDelFilePath count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.action=deleted Filesystem.file_path = "/boot/*" by _time span=1h  Filesystem.dest Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.action | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | where  numOfDelFilePath >= 200 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_high_frequency_of_file_deletion_in_boot_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: linux package installer/uninstaller may cause this event. Please update you filter macro to remove false positives.
