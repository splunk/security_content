description: The following analytic identifies the use of the w32tm.exe utility with
  the /stripchart function, which is indicative of DCRat malware delaying its payload
  execution. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on specific command-line arguments used by w32tm.exe. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate an attempt to evade detection by delaying malicious
  actions such as C2 communication and beaconing. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could allow an attacker to maintain persistence and execute further malicious activities
  undetected.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
