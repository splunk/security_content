description: The following analytic identifies DCRat delay time tactics using w32tm.
  This technique was seen in DCRAT malware where it uses stripchart function of w32tm.exe
  application to delay the execution of its payload like c2 communication , beaconing
  and execution. This anomaly detection may help the analyst to check other possible
  event like the process who execute this command that may lead to DCRat attack.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name = w32tm.exe Processes.process= "* /stripchart *" Processes.process=
  "* /computer:localhost *" Processes.process= "* /period:*" Processes.process= "*
  /dataonly *" Processes.process= "* /samples:*" by  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_system_time_discovery_w32tm_delay_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
