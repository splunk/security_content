description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the dxdiag.exe process
  with specific command-line arguments, which is used to gather system information.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process creation events and command-line details. This activity is significant
  because dxdiag.exe is rarely used in corporate environments and its execution may
  indicate reconnaissance efforts by malicious actors. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could allow attackers to collect detailed system information, aiding in
  further exploitation or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_dxdiag` AND Processes.process
  = "* /t *" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `system_info_gathering_using_dxdiag_application_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This commandline can be used by a network administrator to
  audit host machine specifications. Thus, a filter is needed.
