description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious dxdiag.exe process command-line
  execution. Dxdiag is used to collect the system info of the target host. This technique
  has been used by Remcos RATS, various actors, and other malware to collect information
  as part of the recon or collection phase of an attack. This behavior should rarely
  be seen in a corporate network, but this command line can be used by a network administrator
  to audit host machine specifications. Thus in some rare cases, this detection will
  contain false positives in its results. To triage further, analyze what commands
  were passed after it pipes out the result to a file for further processing.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_dxdiag` AND Processes.process
  = "* /t *" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `system_info_gathering_using_dxdiag_application_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem`
  node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the
  latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: This commandline can be used by a network administrator to
  audit host machine specifications. Thus, a filter is needed.
