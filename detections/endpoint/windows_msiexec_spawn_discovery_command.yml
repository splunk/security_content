description: The following analytic detects MSIExec spawning multiple discovery commands,
  such as Cmd.exe or PowerShell.exe. This behavior is identified using data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where MSIExec
  is the parent process. This activity is significant because MSIExec typically does
  not spawn child processes other than itself, making this behavior highly suspicious.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use these discovery commands to gather
  system information, potentially leading to further exploitation or lateral movement
  within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=msiexec.exe
  Processes.process_name IN ("powershell.exe","cmd.exe", "nltest.exe","ipconfig.exe","systeminfo.exe")

  | `windows_msiexec_spawn_discovery_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present with MSIExec spawning Cmd or
  PowerShell. Filtering will be needed. In addition, add other known discovery processes
  to enhance query.
