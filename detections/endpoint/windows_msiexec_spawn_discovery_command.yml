author: Michael Haag, Splunk
type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies MSIExec spawning multiple discovery
  commands, including spawning Cmd.exe or PowerShell.exe. Typically, child processes
  are not common from MSIExec other than MSIExec spawning itself.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=msiexec.exe
  Processes.process_name IN ("powershell.exe","cmd.exe", "nltest.exe","ipconfig.exe","systeminfo.exe")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_msiexec_spawn_discovery_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present with MSIExec spawning Cmd or
  PowerShell. Filtering will be needed. In addition, add other known discovery processes
  to enhance query.
