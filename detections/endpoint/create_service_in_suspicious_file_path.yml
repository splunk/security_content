  IN ("C:\\Windows\\*", "C:\\Program File*", "C:\\Programdata\\*", "%systemroot%\\*"))
  Service_Type = "user mode service" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by EventCode Service_File_Name Service_Name Service_Start_Type Service_Type
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `create_service_in_suspicious_file_path_filter`'
