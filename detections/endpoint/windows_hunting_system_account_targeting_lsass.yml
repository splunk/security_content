description: The following analytic identifies processes attempting to access Lsass.exe,
  which may indicate credential dumping or applications needing credential access.
  It leverages Sysmon EventCode 10 to detect such activities by analyzing fields like
  TargetImage, GrantedAccess, and SourceImage. This behavior is significant as unauthorized
  access to Lsass.exe can lead to credential theft, posing a severe security risk.
  If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain access to sensitive credentials, potentially
  leading to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe | stats count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, TargetImage, GrantedAccess, SourceImage,
  SourceProcessId, SourceUser, TargetUser  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_hunting_system_account_targeting_lsass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Enabling EventCode 10 TargetProcess lsass.exe is required.
known_false_positives: False positives will occur based on GrantedAccess and SourceUser,
  filter based on source image as needed. Utilize this hunting analytic to tune out
  false positives in TTP or anomaly analytics.
