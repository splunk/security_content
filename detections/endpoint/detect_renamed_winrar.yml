description: The following analtyic identifies renamed instances of `WinRAR.exe`.
  In most cases, it is not common for WinRAR to be used renamed, however it is common
  to be installed by a third party application and executed from a non-standard path.
  During triage, validate additional metadata from the binary that this is `WinRAR`.
  Review parallel processes and file modifications.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.original_file_name="WinRAR.exe"
  (Processes.process_name!="rar.exe" OR Processes.process_name!="winrar.exe") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_renamed_winrar_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Unknown. It is possible third party applications use renamed
  instances of WinRAR.
