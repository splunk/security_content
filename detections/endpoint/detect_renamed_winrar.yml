description: The following analytic identifies instances where `WinRAR.exe` has been
  renamed and executed. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names and original file names within the Endpoint data
  model. This activity is significant because renaming executables is a common tactic
  used by attackers to evade detection. If confirmed malicious, this could indicate
  an attempt to bypass security controls, potentially leading to unauthorized data
  extraction or further system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.original_file_name=WinRAR.exe
  (Processes.process_name!=rar.exe OR Processes.process_name!=winrar.exe) by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_renamed_winrar_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Unknown. It is possible third party applications use renamed
  instances of WinRAR.
