description: The following analytic detects potential unauthorized modifications to Linux cronjobs using text editors like "nano", "vi" or "vim". It identifies this behavior by tracking command-line executions that interact with paths related to cronjob configuration, a common Linux scheduling utility. Cronjob files may be manipulated by attackers for privilege escalation or persistent access, making such changes critical to monitor.\
  The identified behavior is significant for a Security Operations Center (SOC) as it could indicate an ongoing attempt at establishing persistent access or privilege escalation, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.\

  In case of a true positive, the impact could be severe. An attacker with escalated privileges or persistent access could carry out damaging actions, such as data theft, sabotage, or further network penetration.\

  To implement this analytic, ensure ingestion of logs tracking process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. Utilize the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase if you're using Sysmon.\

  Known false positives include legitimate administrative tasks, as these commands may also be used for benign purposes. Careful tuning and filtering based on known benign activity in your environment can minimize these instances.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name IN("nano","vim.basic")
  OR Processes.process IN ("*nano *", "*vi *", "*vim *")) AND Processes.process IN("*/etc/cron*",
  "*/var/spool/cron/*", "*/etc/anacrontab*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name

  | `linux_possible_cronjob_modification_with_editor_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this commandline
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
