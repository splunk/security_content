description: The following analytic identifies a process command line related to the
  discovery of cache domain credential logon count in the registry. This Technique
  was being abused by several post exploitation tool like Winpeas where it query CachedLogonsCount
  registry value in Winlogon registry. This value can be good information about the
  login caching setting on the Windows OS target host. A value of 0 means login caching
  is disable and values > 50 caches only 50 login attempts. By default all versions
  of Windows 10 save cached logins except Windows Server 2008.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
