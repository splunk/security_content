description: The following analytic identifies a process command line querying the
  CachedLogonsCount registry value in the Winlogon registry. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  executions and registry queries. Monitoring this activity is significant as it can
  indicate the use of post-exploitation tools like Winpeas, which gather information
  about login caching settings. If confirmed malicious, this activity could help attackers
  understand login caching configurations, potentially aiding in credential theft
  or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  `process_reg` AND Processes.process
  = "* query *" AND Processes.process = "*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon*"
  AND Processes.process = "*CACHEDLOGONSCOUNT*" by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

  | `windows_cached_domain_credentials_reg_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
