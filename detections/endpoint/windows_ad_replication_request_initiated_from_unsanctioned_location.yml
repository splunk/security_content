description: The following analytic identifies unauthorized Active Directory replication requests initiated from non-domain controller locations. It leverages EventCode 4662 to detect when a computer account with replication permissions creates a handle to domainDNS, filtering out known domain controller IP addresses. This activity is significant as it may indicate a DCSync attack, where an attacker with privileged access can request password hashes for any or all users within the domain. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential full domain compromise.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting eventcode `4662`. The Advanced Security Audit policy settings `Audit Directory Services Access` within `DS Access` needs to be enabled, as well as the following SACLs applied to the domain root and all descendant objects. The principals `everybody`,  `Domain Computers`, and  `Domain Controllers` auditing the permissions `Replicating Directory Changes`, `Replicating Directory Changes All`, and `Replicating Directory Changes In Filtered Set` Assets and Identities will also need to be configured, with the category of domain_controller added for domain controllers.
