description: This alert was written to detect activity associated with the DCSync attack performed by computer accounts.
 When a domain controller receives a replication request, the account permissions are validated, however no checks are performed to validate the request was initiated by a Domain Controller.
 Once an attacker gains control of an account with the necessary privileges, they can request password hashes for any or all users within the domain.
 This alert detects when a computer account account creates a handle to domainDNS with the necessary replication permissions. These requests are then filtered to exclude where the events originate 
 from a known domain controller IP address.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting eventcode `4662`.
 The Advanced Security Audit policy settings `Audit Directory Services Access`
 within `DS Access` needs to be enabled, as well as the following SACLs applied to the domain root
 and all descendant objects. The principals `everybody`,  `Domain Computers`, and  `Domain Controllers`
 auditing the permissions `Replicating Directory Changes`, `Replicating Directory Changes All`, and
 `Replicating Directory Changes In Filtered Set`
 Assets and Identities will also need to be configured, with the category of domain_controller added for domain controllers. 
known_false_positives: Genuine DC promotion may trigger this alert.
