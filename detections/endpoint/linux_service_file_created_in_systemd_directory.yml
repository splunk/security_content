description: The following analytic detects the creation of suspicious service files
  within the systemd directories on Linux platforms. It leverages logs containing
  file name, file path, and process GUID data from endpoints. This activity is significant
  for a SOC as it may indicate an adversary attempting to establish persistence on
  a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to system compromise
  or data exfiltration, allowing attackers to maintain control over the system and
  execute further malicious activities.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_name = *.service
  Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/systemd/system*", "*/lib/systemd/system*", "*/usr/lib/systemd/system*",
  "*/run/systemd/system*", "*~/.config/systemd/*", "*~/.local/share/systemd/*","*/etc/systemd/user*",
  "*/lib/systemd/user*", "*/usr/lib/systemd/user*", "*/run/systemd/user*") by Filesystem.dest
  Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.file_path
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `linux_service_file_created_in_systemd_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may arise when administrators or network operators
  create files in systemd directories for legitimate automation tasks. Therefore,
  it's important to adjust filter macros to account for valid activities. To implement
  this search successfully, it's crucial to ingest appropriate logs, preferably using
  the Linux Sysmon Add-on from Splunkbase for those using Sysmon.
