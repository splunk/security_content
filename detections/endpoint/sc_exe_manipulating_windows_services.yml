datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search looks for arguments to sc.exe indicating the creation or
  modification of a Windows service.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name = sc.exe (Processes.process="* create *" OR Processes.process="*
  config *") by Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `sc_exe_manipulating_windows_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Using sc.exe to manipulate Windows services is uncommon. However,
  there may be legitimate instances of this behavior. It is important to validate
  and investigate as appropriate.
