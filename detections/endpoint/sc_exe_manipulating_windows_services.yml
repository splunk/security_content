description: The following analytic detects the creation or modification of Windows
  services using the sc.exe command. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This
  activity is significant because manipulating Windows services can be a method for
  attackers to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary code.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to maintain long-term
  access, disrupt services, or gain control over critical system functions, posing
  a severe threat to the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name = sc.exe (Processes.process="* create *" OR Processes.process="*
  config *") by Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `sc_exe_manipulating_windows_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Using sc.exe to manipulate Windows services is uncommon. However,
  there may be legitimate instances of this behavior. It is important to validate
  and investigate as appropriate.
