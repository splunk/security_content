description: The following analytic detects the execution of a command to disable an existing scheduled task using 'schtasks.exe' with the '/change' and '/disable' parameters. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. Disabling scheduled tasks is significant as it is a common tactic used by adversaries, including malware like IcedID, to disable security applications and evade detection. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to persist undetected, disable critical security defenses, and further compromise the targeted host.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
