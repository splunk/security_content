description: This search looks for PowerShell processes started with parameters used
  to bypass the local execution policy for scripts. These parameters are often observed
  in attacks leveraging PowerShell scripts as they override the default PowerShell
  execution policy.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.

known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons to bypass the PowerShell execution
  policy. The PowerShell script being run with this parameter should be validated
  to ensure that it is legitimate.
