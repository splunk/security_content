datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search looks for PowerShell processes started with parameters used
  to bypass the local execution policy for scripts. These parameters are often observed
  in attacks leveraging PowerShell scripts as they override the default PowerShell
  execution policy.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process_id) as
  process_id, values(Processes.parent_process_id) as parent_process_id values(Processes.process)
  as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_powershell` (Processes.process="* -ex*" OR Processes.process="* bypass
  *") by Processes.process_id, Processes.user, Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `malicious_powershell_process___execution_policy_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons to bypass the PowerShell execution
  policy. The PowerShell script being run with this parameter should be validated
  to ensure that it is legitimate.
