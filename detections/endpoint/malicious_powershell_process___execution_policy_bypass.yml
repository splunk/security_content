description: The following analytic detects PowerShell processes initiated with parameters
  that bypass the local execution policy for scripts. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions containing
  specific flags like "-ex" or "bypass." This activity is significant because bypassing
  execution policies is a common tactic used by attackers to run malicious scripts
  undetected. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code, potentially leading to further system compromise, data exfiltration, or persistent
  access within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process_id) as
  process_id, values(Processes.parent_process_id) as parent_process_id values(Processes.process)
  as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_powershell` (Processes.process="* -ex*" OR Processes.process="* bypass
  *") by Processes.process_id, Processes.user, Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `malicious_powershell_process___execution_policy_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons to bypass the PowerShell execution
  policy. The PowerShell script being run with this parameter should be validated
  to ensure that it is legitimate.
