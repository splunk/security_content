description: The following analytic identifies the execution of RemCom.exe, an open-source alternative to PsExec, used for lateral movement and remote command execution. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, original file names, and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it indicates potential lateral movement within the network. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute commands remotely, potentially leading to further compromise and control over additional systems within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on Administrative use. Filter as needed.
