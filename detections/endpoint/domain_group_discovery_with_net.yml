description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `net.exe` with command-line
  arguments used to query domain groups, specifically `group /domain`. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
  and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
  reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to enumerate domain groups, which is a common
  step in Active Directory Discovery. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
  allow attackers to gain insights into the domain structure, aiding in further attacks
  such as privilege escalation or lateral movement.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="net.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="net1.exe") (Processes.process=*group* AND Processes.process=*/do*)
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `domain_group_discovery_with_net_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
