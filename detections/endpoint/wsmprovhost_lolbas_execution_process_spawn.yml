description: The following analytic identifies `Wsmprovhost.exe` spawning a LOLBAS execution process. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data to detect when `Wsmprovhost.exe` spawns child processes that are known LOLBAS (Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts) executables. This activity is significant because it may indicate an adversary using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to execute code on remote endpoints, a common technique for lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may trigger this behavior, filter as needed.
