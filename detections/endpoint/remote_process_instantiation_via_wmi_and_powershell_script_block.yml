datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of the `Invoke-WmiMethod` commandlet with arguments utilized
  to start a process on a remote endpoint by abusing WMI. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may abuse WMI and this commandlet for lateral movement and remote code execution.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (Message="*Invoke-WmiMethod*" AND Message="*-CN*"
  AND Message="*-Class Win32_Process*" AND Message="*-Name create*") | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Message ComputerName
  User | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `remote_process_instantiation_via_wmi_and_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup instructions
  can be found https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WWMI and powershell.exe to start
  a process on remote systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set
  of hosts or users.
