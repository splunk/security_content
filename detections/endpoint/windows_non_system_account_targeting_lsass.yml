name: Windows Non-System Account Targeting Lsass

type: TTP
datamodel: []
description: The following analytic identifies non SYSTEM accounts requesting access
  to lsass.exe. This behavior may be related to credential dumping or applications
  requiring access to credentials. Triaging this event will require understanding
  the GrantedAccess from the SourceImage. In addition, whether the account is privileged
  or not. Review the process requesting permissions and review parallel processes.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe NOT (SourceUser="NT AUTHORITY\\*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, TargetImage,
  GrantedAccess, SourceImage, SourceProcessId, SourceUser, TargetUser | rename Computer
  as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_non_system_account_targeting_lsass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Enabling EventCode 10 TargetProcess lsass.exe is required.
known_false_positives: False positives will occur based on legitimate application
  requests, filter based on source image as needed.
