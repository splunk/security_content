name: Windows Non-System Account Targeting Lsass

status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies non-SYSTEM accounts requesting access
  to lsass.exe. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 10 logs to monitor access
  attempts to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe) by non-SYSTEM
  users. This activity is significant as it may indicate credential dumping attempts
  or unauthorized access to sensitive credentials. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could potentially extract credentials from memory, leading to privilege escalation
  or lateral movement within the network. Immediate investigation is required to determine
  the legitimacy of the access request and to mitigate any potential threats.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe NOT (SourceUser="NT AUTHORITY\\*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, parent_process_name,
  parent_process_path ,parent_process_id, TargetImage, GrantedAccess, SourceUser,
  TargetUser | rename TargetUser as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_non_system_account_targeting_lsass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Enabling EventCode 10 TargetProcess lsass.exe is required.
known_false_positives: False positives will occur based on legitimate application
  requests, filter based on source image as needed.
