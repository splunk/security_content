description: This analytic identifies suspicious modification of ACL permission to
  a files or folder to make it available to everyone. This technique may be used by
  the adversary to evade ACLs or protected files access. This changes is commonly
  configured by the file or directory owner with appropriate permission. This behavior
  is a good indicator if this command seen on a machine utilized by an account with
  no permission to do so.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "cacls.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "icacls.exe" OR Processes.process_name = "xcacls.exe"
  AND (Processes.process = "*/G everyone:*"  OR Processes.process = "*/G SYSTEM:*")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed cacls.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: administrators may use this command. Filter as needed.
