description: This analytic identifies suspicious modification of ACL permission to
  a files or folder to make it available to everyone. This technique may be used by
  the adversary to evade ACLs or protected files access. This changes is commonly
  configured by the file or directory owner with appropriate permission. This behavior
  is a good indicator if this command seen on a machine utilized by an account with
  no permission to do so.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrators may use this command. Filter as needed.
