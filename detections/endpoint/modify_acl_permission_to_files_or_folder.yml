description: The following analytic detects the modification of ACL permissions to
  files or folders, making them accessible to everyone. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on processes like "cacls.exe," "icacls.exe,"
  and "xcacls.exe" with specific command-line arguments. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate an adversary attempting to evade ACLs or access protected files.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data,
  potentially leading to data breaches or further system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name = "cacls.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "icacls.exe" OR Processes.process_name = "xcacls.exe")
  AND Processes.process = "*/G*" AND (Processes.process = "* everyone:*"  OR Processes.process
  = "* SYSTEM:*" OR Processes.process = "* S-1-1-0:*") by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `modify_acl_permission_to_files_or_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrators may use this command. Filter as needed.
