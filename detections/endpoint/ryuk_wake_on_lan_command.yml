description: The following analytic detects the use of Wake-on-LAN commands associated
  with Ryuk ransomware. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on specific process and command-line activities. This behavior
  is significant as Ryuk ransomware uses Wake-on-LAN to power on devices in a compromised
  network, increasing its encryption success rate. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could lead to widespread ransomware encryption across multiple endpoints, causing
  significant operational disruption and data loss. Immediate isolation and thorough
  investigation of the affected endpoints are crucial to mitigate the impact.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process="*8 LAN*"
  OR Processes.process="*9 REP*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `ryuk_wake_on_lan_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited to no known false positives.
