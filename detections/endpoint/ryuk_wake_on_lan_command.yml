description: The following analytic detects the use of Wake-on-LAN commands associated with Ryuk ransomware. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific process and command-line activities. This behavior is significant as Ryuk ransomware uses Wake-on-LAN to power on devices in a compromised network, increasing its encryption success rate. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to widespread ransomware encryption across multiple endpoints, causing significant operational disruption and data loss. Immediate isolation and thorough investigation of the affected endpoints are crucial to mitigate the impact.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited to no known false positives.
