type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the deletion of SSL certificates on a
  Linux machine. It leverages filesystem event logs to identify when files with extensions
  .pem or .crt are deleted from the /etc/ssl/certs/ directory. This activity is significant
  because attackers may delete or modify SSL certificates to disable security features
  or evade defenses on a compromised system. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could indicate an attempt to disrupt secure communications, evade detection, or
  execute a destructive payload, potentially leading to significant security breaches
  and data loss.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.action=deleted Filesystem.file_path
  = "/etc/ssl/certs/*" Filesystem.file_path IN ("*.pem", "*.crt") by _time span=1h
  Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.dest Filesystem.process_guid
  Filesystem.action | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_deletion_of_ssl_certificate_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
