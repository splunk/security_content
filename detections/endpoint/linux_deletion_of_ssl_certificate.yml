status: production
type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of ssl certificate in a linux machine.
  attacker may delete or modify ssl certificate to impair some security features or
  act as defense evasion in compromised linux machine. This Anomaly can be also a
  good indicator of a malware trying to wipe or delete several files in a compromised
  host as part of its destructive payload like what acidrain malware does in linux
  or router machines. This detection can be a good pivot to check what process and
  user tries to delete this type of files which is not so common and need further
  investigation.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.action=deleted Filesystem.file_path
  = "/etc/ssl/certs/*" Filesystem.file_path IN ("*.pem", "*.crt") by _time span=1h
  Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.dest Filesystem.process_guid
  Filesystem.action | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`  
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_deletion_of_ssl_certificate_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
