description: The following analytic detects the deletion of SSL certificates on a Linux machine. It leverages filesystem event logs to identify when files with extensions .pem or .crt are deleted from the /etc/ssl/certs/ directory. This activity is significant because attackers may delete or modify SSL certificates to disable security features or evade defenses on a compromised system. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate an attempt to disrupt secure communications, evade detection, or execute a destructive payload, potentially leading to significant security breaches and data loss.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.action=deleted Filesystem.file_path = "/etc/ssl/certs/*" Filesystem.file_path IN ("*.pem", "*.crt") by _time span=1h Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.dest Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.action | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_deletion_of_ssl_certificate_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
