description: The following analytic detects a process creating a `.lnk` file in suspicious locations such as `C:\User*` or `*\Local\Temp\*`. It leverages filesystem and process activity data from the Endpoint data model to identify this behavior. This activity is significant because creating `.lnk` files in these directories is a common tactic used by spear phishing tools to establish persistence or execute malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to maintain persistence, execute arbitrary code, or further compromise the system.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records filesystem and process activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint data model. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black, or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon.
known_false_positives: This detection should yield little or no false positive results. It is uncommon for LNK files to be executed from temporary or user directories.
