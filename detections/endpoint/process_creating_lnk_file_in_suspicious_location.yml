description: This search looks for a process launching an `*.lnk` file under `C:\User*`
  or `*\Local\Temp\*`. This is common behavior used by various spear phishing tools.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records filesystem and process activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint data model. This is typically populated
  via endpoint detection-and-response products, such as Carbon Black, or endpoint
  data sources, such as Sysmon.

known_false_positives: This detection should yield little or no false positive results.
  It is uncommon for LNK files to be executed from temporary or user directories.
