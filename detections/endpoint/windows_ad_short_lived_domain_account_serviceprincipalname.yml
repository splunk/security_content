description: The following analytic identifies the addition of a Service Principal Name to a domain account that is quickly deleted within 5 minutes or less. While this event may be part of a legitimate action part of certain administrative operations,
  it may also be evidence of a persistence attack. Domain accounts with Service Principal Names are vulnerable to a technique called Kerberoasting that enables attackers to potentially obtain the cleartext password 
  of the account by performing offline cracking. An adversary who has obtained privileged access to a domain environment may add an SPN to a privileged account to then leverage the Kerberoasting technique and attempt
  to obtain its clertext password. To clean things up, the adversary may delete the SPN which will trigger this detection.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting eventcode 
 `5136`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes` 
 within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. Additionally, a SACL needs to be created for AD objects in order to ingest attribute modifications.
known_false_positives: A Service Principal Name should only be added to an account when an application requires it. Adding an SPN and quickly deleting it
  is less common but may be part of legitimate action. Filter as needed.
