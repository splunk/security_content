description: The following analytic identifies the addition and quick deletion of
  a Service Principal Name (SPN) to a domain account within 5 minutes. This detection
  leverages EventCode 5136 from the Windows Security Event Log, focusing on changes
  to the servicePrincipalName attribute. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  an attempt to perform Kerberoasting, a technique used to crack the cleartext password
  of a domain account offline. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or escalate privileges within
  the domain environment.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=5136 AttributeLDAPDisplayName=servicePrincipalName
  | transaction ObjectDN AttributeValue startswith=(EventCode=5136 OperationType="%%14674")
  endswith=(EventCode=5136 OperationType="%%14675") | eval short_lived=case((duration<300),"TRUE")
  | search short_lived = TRUE | rename ObjectDN as user | `windows_ad_short_lived_domain_account_serviceprincipalname_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting eventcode
  `5136`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes`
  within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. Additionally, a SACL needs to be created
  for AD objects in order to ingest attribute modifications.
known_false_positives: A Service Principal Name should only be added to an account
  when an application requires it. Adding an SPN and quickly deleting it is less common
  but may be part of legitimate action. Filter as needed.
