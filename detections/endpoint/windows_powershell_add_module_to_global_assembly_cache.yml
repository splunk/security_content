description: The following PowerShell Script Block analytic identifies the native
  ability to add a DLL to the Windows Global Assembly Cache. Each computer where the
  Common Language Runtime is installed has a machine-wide code cache called the Global
  Assembly Cache. The Global Assembly Cache stores assemblies specifically designated
  to be shared by several applications on the computer. By adding a DLL to the GAC,
  this allows an adversary to call it via any other means across the operating systems.
  This is native and built into Windows. Per the Microsoft blog, the more high fidelity
  method may be to look for W3WP.exe spawning PowerShell that includes the same CommandLine
  as identified in this analytic.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN("*system.enterpriseservices.internal.publish*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer user_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_powershell_add_module_to_global_assembly_cache_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on developers or third
  party utilities adding items to the GAC.
