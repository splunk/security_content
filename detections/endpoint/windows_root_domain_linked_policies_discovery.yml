type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the use of the `[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator in PowerShell to query Active Directory for root domain linked policies. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this activity. This behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt by adversaries or Red Teams to gain situational awareness and perform Active Directory Discovery. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to map out domain policies, potentially aiding in further exploitation or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*[adsisearcher]*" ScriptBlockText = "*.SearchRooT*" ScriptBlockText = "*.gplink*" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer user_id | rename Computer as dest, user_id as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_root_domain_linked_policies_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
