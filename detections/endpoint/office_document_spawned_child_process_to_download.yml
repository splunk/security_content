description: The following analytic identifies Office applications spawning child
  processes to download content via HTTP/HTTPS. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where Office applications
  like Word or Excel initiate network connections, excluding common browsers. This
  activity is significant as it often indicates the use of malicious documents to
  execute living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) for payload delivery. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration,
  or further malware deployment, posing a severe threat to the organization's security.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Default browser not in the filter list.
