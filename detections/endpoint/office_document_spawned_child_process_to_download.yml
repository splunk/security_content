description: this search is to detect potential malicious office document executing
  lolbin child process to download payload or other malware. Since most of the attacker
  abused the capability of office document to execute living on land application to
  blend it to the normal noise in the infected machine to cover its track.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=1 parent_process_name IN ("powerpnt.exe", "winword.exe",
  "excel.exe", "visio.exe") process_name = "*.exe" cmdline IN ("*http:*","*https:*")  NOT(OriginalFileName
  IN("*\\firefox.exe", "*\\chrome.exe","*\\iexplore.exe","*\\msedge.exe")) | stats

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances office application and browser may be
  used.
