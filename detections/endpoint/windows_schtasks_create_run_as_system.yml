description: The following analytic detects the creation of a new scheduled task using
  Schtasks.exe to run as the SYSTEM user. This detection leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process
  details. This activity is significant as it often indicates an attempt to gain elevated
  privileges or maintain persistence within the environment. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could execute code with SYSTEM-level privileges, potentially leading
  to data theft, ransomware deployment, or further system compromise. Immediate investigation
  and mitigation are crucial to prevent further damage.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_schtasks` Processes.process="*/create
  *" AND Processes.process="*/ru *" AND Processes.process="*system*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_schtasks_create_run_as_system_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to legitimate applications
  creating a task to run as SYSTEM. Filter as needed based on parent process, or modify
  the query to have world writeable paths to restrict it.
