description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a new task to start
  and run as an elevated user - SYSTEM using Schtasks.exe. This behavior is commonly
  used by adversaries to spawn a process in an elevated state. If a true positive
  is found, it suggests an attacker is attempting to persist within the environment
  or potentially deliver additional malicious payloads, leading to data theft, ransomware,
  or other damaging outcomes. Upon triage, review the scheduled task's source and
  the command to be executed. Capture and inspect any relevant on-disk artifacts,
  and look for concurrent processes to identify the attack source. This approach helps
  analysts detect potential threats earlier and mitigate the risks.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_schtasks` Processes.process="*/create
  *" AND Processes.process="*/ru *" AND Processes.process="*system*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_schtasks_create_run_as_system_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to legitimate applications
  creating a task to run as SYSTEM. Filter as needed based on parent process, or modify
  the query to have world writeable paths to restrict it.
