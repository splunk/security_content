description: The following analytic detects any Windows Office Product spawning `rundll32.exe` without a `.dll` file extension. This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process and parent process relationships. This activity is significant as it is a known tactic of the IcedID malware family, which can lead to unauthorized code execution. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or further malware deployment. Immediate investigation and containment are recommended.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present, filter as needed.
