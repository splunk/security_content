name: Office Product Spawning Rundll32 with no DLL

type: TTP
description: The following detection identifies the latest behavior utilized by IcedID
  malware family. This detection identifies any Windows Office Product spawning `rundll32.exe`
  without a `.dll` file extension. In malicious instances, the command-line of `rundll32.exe`
  will look like `rundll32 ..\oepddl.igk2,DllRegisterServer`. In addition, Threat
  Research has released a detection identifying the use of `DllRegisterServer` on
  the command-line of `rundll32.exe`. In this instance, we narrow our detection down
  to the Office suite as a parent process. During triage, review all file modifications.
  Capture and analyze the `DLL` that was dropped to disk. The Office Product will
  have reached out to a remote destination, capture and block the IPs or domain. Review
  additional parallel processes for further activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present,
  filter as needed.
