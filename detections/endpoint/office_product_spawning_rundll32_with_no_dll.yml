name: Office Product Spawning Rundll32 with no DLL

type: TTP
description: The following detection identifies the latest behavior utilized by IcedID
  malware family. This detection identifies any Windows Office Product spawning `rundll32.exe`
  without a `.dll` file extension. In malicious instances, the command-line of `rundll32.exe`
  will look like `rundll32 ..\oepddl.igk2,DllRegisterServer`. In addition, Threat
  Research has released a detection identifying the use of `DllRegisterServer` on
  the command-line of `rundll32.exe`. In this instance, we narrow our detection down
  to the Office suite as a parent process. During triage, review all file modifications.
  Capture and analyze the `DLL` that was dropped to disk. The Office Product will
  have reached out to a remote destination, capture and block the IPs or domain. Review
  additional parallel processes for further activity.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("winword.exe","excel.exe","powerpnt.exe","mspub.exe","visio.exe","onenote.exe","onenotem.exe","onenoteviewer.exe","onenoteim.exe",
  "msaccess.exe", "Graph.exe","winproj.exe") `process_rundll32` (Processes.process!=*.dll*) by Processes.dest

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `office_product_spawning_rundll32_with_no_dll_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present,
  filter as needed.
