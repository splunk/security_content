description: This analytic is to look for suspicious modification or creation of registry
  to have service entry. This technique is abused by adversaries or threat actor to
  persist, gain privileges in the machine or even lateral movement. This technique
  can be executed using reg.exe application or using windows API like for example
  the CrashOveride malware. This detection is a good indicator that a process is trying
  to create a service entry using registry ImagePath.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path="*\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services*"
  Registry.registry_value_name = ImagePath by _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user

  process proc_guid registry_path registry_value_name registry_value_data | `windows_service_creation_using_registry_entry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Third party tools may used this technique to create services
  but not so common.
