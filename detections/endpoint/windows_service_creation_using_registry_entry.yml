description: The following analytic detects when reg.exe modify registry keys that
  define Windows services and their configurations in Windows to detect potential
  threats earlier and mitigate the risks. This detection is made by a Splunk query
  that searches for specific keywords in the process name, parent process name, user,
  and process ID. This detection is important because it suggests that an attacker
  has modified the registry keys that define Windows services and their configurations,
  which can allow them to maintain access to the system and potentially move laterally
  within the network. It is a common technique used by attackers to gain persistence
  on a compromised system and its impact can lead to data theft, ransomware, or other
  damaging outcomes. False positives can occur since legitimate uses of reg.exe to
  modify registry keys for Windows services can also trigger this alert. Next steps
  include reviewing the process and user context of the reg.exe activity and identify
  any other concurrent processes that might be associated with the attack upon triage.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  WHERE (Registry.registry_path="*\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services*" Registry.registry_value_name
  = ImagePath) BY _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | where isnotnull(registry_value_data)
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_creation_using_registry_entry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the offical
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
known_false_positives: Third party tools may used this technique to create services
  but not so common.
