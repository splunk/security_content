description: The following analytic identifies suspicious modifications in the registry
  entry, specifically targeting paths used by malware like REVIL. It detects changes
  in registry paths such as `SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Facebook_Assistant` and `SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\BlackLivesMatter`.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on registry modifications linked to process GUIDs. This activity is significant
  as it indicates potential malware persistence mechanisms, often used by advanced
  persistent threats (APTs) and ransomware. If confirmed malicious, this could allow
  attackers to maintain persistence, encrypt files, and store critical ransomware-related
  information on compromised hosts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
