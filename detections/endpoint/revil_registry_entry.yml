  notes file name in the compromised host.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Registry.registry_key_name)

how_to_implement: to successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Image, TargetObject registry key, registry Details from your endpoints.
