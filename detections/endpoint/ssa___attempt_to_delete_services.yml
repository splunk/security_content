description: This analytic identifies suspicious series of attempt to kill multiple
  services on a system using either `net.exe` or `sc.exe`. This technique is use by
  adversaries to terminate security services or other related services to continue
  there objective and evade detections.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed sc.exe may be used.
