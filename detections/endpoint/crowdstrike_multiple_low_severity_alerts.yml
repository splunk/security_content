description: The following analytic detects multiple CrowdStrike LOW severity alerts, indicating a series of minor suspicious activities or policy violations. These alerts are not immediately critical but should be reviewed to prevent potential threats. They often highlight unusual behavior or low-level risks that, if left unchecked, could escalate into more significant security issues. Regular monitoring and analysis of these alerts are essential for maintaining robust security.

how_to_implement: To implement CrowdStrike stream JSON logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "CrowdStrike:Event:Streams:JSON" event stream. Process and store the JSON logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.
