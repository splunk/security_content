description: This analytic identifies potential adversaries that modify the security
  permission of a specific file or directory. This technique is commonly seen in APT
  tradecraft, ransomware and coinminer scripts to evade detections and restrict access
  to their component files.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed icacls.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: network administrator may use this windows utility but this
  is not a common practice.
