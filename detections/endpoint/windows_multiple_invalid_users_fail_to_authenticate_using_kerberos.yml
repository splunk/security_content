description: 'The following analytic identifies a source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique invalid domain users using the Kerberos protocol. This detection
  leverages EventCode 4768, specifically looking for failure code 0x6, indicating
  the user is not found in the Kerberos database. This activity is significant as
  it may indicate a Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain
  initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the Active Directory environment,
  posing a significant security risk.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple invalid domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, multi-user systems and missconfigured
  systems.
