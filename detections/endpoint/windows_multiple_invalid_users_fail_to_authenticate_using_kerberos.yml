description: 'The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique invalid domain users using the Kerberos protocol. This behavior could
  represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory
  environment using Kerberos to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Active
  Directory environments can be very different depending on the organization. Users
  should test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed. As
  attackers progress in a breach, mistakes will be made. In certain scenarios, adversaries
  may execute a password spraying attack using an invalid list of users. Event 4768
  is generated every time the Key Distribution Center issues a Kerberos Ticket Granting
  Ticket (TGT). Failure code 0x6 stands for `client not found in Kerberos database`
  (the attempted user is not a valid domain user).\

  This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting
  exercises. This detection will only trigger on domain controllers, not on member
  servers or workstations.\

  The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by
  providing fields like source ip and attempted user accounts.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple invalid domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, multi-user systems and missconfigured
  systems.
