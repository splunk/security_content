date: '2024-09-30'
description: The following analytic identifies a source endpoint failing to authenticate with 30 unique invalid domain users using the Kerberos protocol. This detection leverages EventCode 4768, specifically looking for failure code 0x6, indicating the user is not found in the Kerberos database. This activity is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the Active Directory environment, posing a significant security risk.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
id: 001266a6-9d5b-11eb-829b-acde48001122
known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple invalid domain users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, multi-user systems and missconfigured systems.
