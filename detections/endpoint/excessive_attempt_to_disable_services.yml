description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious series of command-line
  executions attempting to disable multiple services. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on processes where "sc.exe" is used
  with parameters like "config" or "Disabled" within a short time frame. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate an adversary's attempt to disable security or
  other critical services to further compromise the system. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to the attacker achieving persistence, evading detection, or disabling
  security mechanisms, thereby increasing the risk of further exploitation.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where   Processes.process_name =
  "sc.exe" AND Processes.process="*config*" OR Processes.process="*Disabled*" by Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest Processes.user _time span=1m | where
  count >=4 | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_attempt_to_disable_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
