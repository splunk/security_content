description: This analytic will identify suspicious series of command-line to disable
  several services. This technique is seen where the adversary attempts to disable
  security app services or other malware services to complete the objective on the
  compromised system.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where   Processes.process_name =
  "sc.exe" AND Processes.process="*config*" OR Processes.process="*Disabled*" by Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest Processes.user _time span=1m | where
  count >=5 | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_attempt_to_disable_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed sc.exe may be used.
