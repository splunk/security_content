description: The following analytic detects the use of the decompile parameter with the HTML Help application (HH.exe). This behavior is identified through Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line executions involving the decompile parameter. This activity is significant because it is an uncommon command and has been associated with APT41 campaigns, where it was used to unpack HTML help files for further malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this technique could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to further compromise and persistence within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, filter as needed.
