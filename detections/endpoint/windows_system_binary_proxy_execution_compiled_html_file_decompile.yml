description: The following analytic detects the use of the decompile parameter with
  the HTML Help application (HH.exe). This behavior is identified through Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line executions involving
  the decompile parameter. This activity is significant because it is an uncommon
  command and has been associated with APT41 campaigns, where it was used to unpack
  HTML help files for further malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this technique
  could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to further
  compromise and persistence within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_hh` Processes.process=*-decompile*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, filter as needed.
