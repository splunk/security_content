description: 'The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the command
  sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs will output
  to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable on critical endpoints or all.
  

  This analytic identifies PowerShell cmdlet - `get-localgroup` being ran. Typically,
  by itself, is not malicious but may raise suspicion based on time of day, endpoint
  and username. 

  During triage, review parallel processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It
  will be important to understand the timeline of events around this activity. Review
  the entire logged PowerShell script block.'
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*get-localgroup*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Opcode Computer UserID EventCode
  ScriptBlockText  | rename Computer as dest, UserID as user
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_get_localgroup_discovery_with_script_block_logging_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune as needed.
