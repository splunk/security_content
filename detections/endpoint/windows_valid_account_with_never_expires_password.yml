description: The following analytic detects the use of net.exe to update user account
  policies to set passwords as non-expiring. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving "/maxpwage:unlimited".
  This activity is significant as it can indicate an attempt to maintain persistence,
  escalate privileges, evade defenses, or facilitate lateral movement. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to maintain long-term access to
  compromised accounts, potentially leading to further exploitation and unauthorized
  access to sensitive information.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_net` AND Processes.process="* accounts *" AND Processes.process="*
  /maxpwage:unlimited" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_valid_account_with_never_expires_password_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This behavior is not commonly seen in production environment
  and not advisable, filter as needed.
