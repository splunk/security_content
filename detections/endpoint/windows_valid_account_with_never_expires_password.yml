datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies net.exe updating user account policies
  for password requirement with non-expiring password. This technique was seen in
  several adversaries and malware like Azorult to maintain the foothold (persistence),
  gaining privilege escalation, defense evasion and possible for lateral movement
  for specific users or created user account on the targeted host. This TTP detections
  is a good pivot to see further what other events that users executes on the machines.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_net` AND Processes.process="* accounts *" AND Processes.process="*
  /maxpwage:unlimited" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_valid_account_with_never_expires_password_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: This behavior is not commonly seen in production environment
  and not advisable, filter as needed.
