description: The following analytic detects the creation of sqlite3.dll files in the
  %temp% folder. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 11 to identify when these files are
  written to the temporary directory. This activity is significant because it is associated
  with IcedID malware, which uses the sqlite3 module to parse browser databases and
  steal sensitive information such as banking details, credit card information, and
  credentials. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to significant data
  theft and compromise of user accounts.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11 (TargetFilename = "*\\sqlite32.dll" OR TargetFilename
  = "*\\sqlite64.dll") (TargetFilename = "*\\temp\\*") | stats count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id process_name file_name
  file_path action process_guid| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `sqlite_module_in_temp_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
