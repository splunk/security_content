name: Linux Add Files In Known Crontab Directories

description: The following analytic detects unauthorized file creation in known crontab
  directories on Unix-based systems. It leverages filesystem data to identify new
  files in directories such as /etc/cron* and /var/spool/cron/*. This activity is
  significant as it may indicate an attempt by threat actors or malware to establish
  persistence on a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to execute arbitrary code at scheduled intervals, potentially leading to further
  system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/cron*",
  "*/var/spool/cron/*") by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name
  Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_add_files_in_known_crontab_directories_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create file in crontab
  folders for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false
  positives.
