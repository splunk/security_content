description: this search is to detect a suspicious office product process that spawn
  cmd child process. This is commonly seen in a ms office product having macro to
  execute shell command to download or execute malicious lolbin relative to its malicious
  code. This is seen in trickbot spear phishing doc where it execute shell cmd to
  run mshta payload.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "winword.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name= "excel.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name
  = "powerpnt.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name= "onenote.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name

  | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `office_product_spawn_cmd_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: IT or network admin may create an document automation that
  will run shell script.
