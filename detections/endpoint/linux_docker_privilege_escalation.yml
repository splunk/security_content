description: Docker is an open source containerization platform. It helps programmers
  to bundle applications into containers, which are standardized executable parts
  that include the application source code along with the OS libraries and dependencies
  needed to run that code in any setting. The user can add mount the root directory
  into a container and edit the /etc/password file to add a super user. This requires
  the user to be privileged enough to run docker, i.e. being in the docker group or
  being root.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN("*docker*-v*/*:*","*docker*--volume*/*:*")
  OR Processes.process IN("*docker*exec*sh*","*docker*exec*bash*") by Processes.dest

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.
