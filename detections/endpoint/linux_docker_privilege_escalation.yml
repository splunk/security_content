description: The following analytic detects attempts to escalate privileges on a Linux system using Docker. It identifies processes where Docker commands are used to mount the root directory or execute shell commands within a container. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names, command-line arguments, and parent processes. This activity is significant because it can allow an attacker with Docker privileges to modify critical system files, such as /etc/passwd, to create a superuser. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise and persistent unauthorized access.

- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN("*docker*-v*/*:*","*docker*--volume*/*:*") OR Processes.process IN("*docker*exec*sh*","*docker*exec*bash*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_docker_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system administrative usage. Filter as needed.
