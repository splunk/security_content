description: The following analytic detects attempts to escalate privileges on a Linux
  system using Docker. It identifies processes where Docker commands are used to mount
  the root directory or execute shell commands within a container. This detection
  leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names,
  command-line arguments, and parent processes. This activity is significant because
  it can allow an attacker with Docker privileges to modify critical system files,
  such as /etc/passwd, to create a superuser. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
  to full system compromise and persistent unauthorized access.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN("*docker*-v*/*:*","*docker*--volume*/*:*")
  OR Processes.process IN("*docker*exec*sh*","*docker*exec*bash*") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_docker_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.
