description: Docker is an open source containerization platform. It helps programmers to bundle applications into containers, 
  which are standardized executable parts that include the application source code along with the OS libraries and dependencies needed to run 
  that code in any setting. The user can add mount the root directory into a container and edit the /etc/password file to add a super user.
  This requires the user to be privileged enough to run docker, i.e. being in the docker group or being root.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN("*docker*-v*/*:*","*docker*--volume*/*:*") OR Processes.process IN("*docker*exec*sh*","*docker*exec*bash*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name

  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_docker_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system administrative usage. Filter as needed.
