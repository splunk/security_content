- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies rundll32.exe with no command line arguments
  and performing a network connection. It is unusual for rundll32.exe to execute with
  no command line arguments present. This particular behavior is common with malicious
  software, including Cobalt Strike. During investigation, triage any network connections
  and parallel processes. Identify any suspicious module loads related to credential
  dumping or file writes. Rundll32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and
  C:\Windows\syswow64.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=rundll32.exe by _time span=1h  Processes.process_id

  | regex process="(rundll32\.exe.{0,4}$)" | join  process_id [| tstats `security_content_summariesonly`
  count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Ports where Ports.dest_port !="0" by Ports.process_id

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `port` node.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of rundll32, triggering a false positive.
