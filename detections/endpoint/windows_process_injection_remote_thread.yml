- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious remote thread execution in some process being abused by threat actor and malware like 
  qakbot. Qakbot is one of the malware using this technique to load its malicious dll module or malicious code in the targeted host. 
  This TTP can be a good pivot to verify what is the behavior of the targeted Image process after this detection trigger. 
  look for network connection, child process execution, file access and many more that helps to verify the indication of malware infection.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 TargetImage IN ("*\\Taskmgr.exe", "*\\calc.exe", "*\\notepad.exe", "*\\rdpclip.exe", "*\\explorer.exe", "*\\wermgr.exe", "*\\ping.exe", "*\\OneDriveSetup.exe", "*\\dxdiag.exe", "*\\mobsync.exe", "*\\msra.exe", "*\\xwizard.exe") 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by  TargetImage TargetProcessId SourceProcessId  EventCode StartAddress SourceImage Computer 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_process_injection_remote_thread_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts like remote thread EventCode=8 of sysmon.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
