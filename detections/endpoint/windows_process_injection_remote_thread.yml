description: The following analytic detects suspicious remote thread execution in
  processes such as Taskmgr.exe, calc.exe, and notepad.exe, which may indicate process
  injection by malware like Qakbot. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 8 to
  identify remote thread creation in specific target processes. This activity is significant
  as it often signifies an attempt by malware to inject malicious code into legitimate
  processes, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain
  persistence on the compromised host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 TargetImage IN ("*\\Taskmgr.exe", "*\\calc.exe", "*\\notepad.exe",
  "*\\rdpclip.exe", "*\\explorer.exe", "*\\wermgr.exe", "*\\ping.exe", "*\\OneDriveSetup.exe",
  "*\\dxdiag.exe", "*\\mobsync.exe", "*\\msra.exe", "*\\xwizard.exe","*\\cmd.exe",
  "*\\powershell.exe") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by  TargetImage TargetProcessId SourceProcessId  EventCode StartAddress SourceImage
  dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_process_injection_remote_thread_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts like remote thread EventCode=8 of
  sysmon. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon
  TA.
