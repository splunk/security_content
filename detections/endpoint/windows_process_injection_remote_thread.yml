status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious remote thread execution
  in some process being abused by threat actor and malware like qakbot. Qakbot is
  one of the malware using this technique to load its malicious dll module or malicious
  code in the targeted host. This TTP can be a good pivot to verify what is the behavior
  of the targeted Image process after this detection trigger. look for network connection,
  child process execution, file access and many more that helps to verify the indication
  of malware infection.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 TargetImage IN ("*\\Taskmgr.exe", "*\\calc.exe", "*\\notepad.exe",
  "*\\rdpclip.exe", "*\\explorer.exe", "*\\wermgr.exe", "*\\ping.exe", "*\\OneDriveSetup.exe",
  "*\\dxdiag.exe", "*\\mobsync.exe", "*\\msra.exe", "*\\xwizard.exe","*\\cmd.exe", "*\\powershell.exe") | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by  TargetImage TargetProcessId SourceProcessId  EventCode
  StartAddress SourceImage dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_process_injection_remote_thread_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts like remote thread EventCode=8 of
  sysmon. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon
  TA.
