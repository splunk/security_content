description: 'The following analytic is designed to detect anomalous behavior associated
  with the BlackLotus Campaign, a sophisticated bootkit attack reported by ESET and
  further investigated in a blog by Microsoft, which provided hunting queries for
  security analysts. The primary focus of this analytic is to identify instances of
  Winlogon.exe, a critical Windows process, connecting to public IP space, which is
  indicative of potential malicious activity.\ The BlackLotus Campaign is a bootkit-based
  attack that compromises system integrity by infecting the Master Boot Record (MBR)
  and Volume Boot Record (VBR). This malware variant can bypass traditional security
  measures, load before the operating system, and maintain persistence on the target
  system.\

  Winlogon.exe is a critical Windows process responsible for managing user logon and
  logoff processes. Under normal circumstances, Winlogon.exe should not be connecting
  to public IP addresses. However, if it does, it may indicate that the process has
  been compromised as part of the BlackLotus Campaign or another malicious operation.\

  This analytic monitors network connections made by Winlogon.exe and triggers an
  alert if it detects connections to public IP space. By identifying such anomalous
  behavior, security analysts can investigate further and respond swiftly to potential
  threats.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present and filtering will be required.
  Legitimate IPs will be present and need to be filtered.
