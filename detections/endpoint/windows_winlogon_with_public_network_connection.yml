description: 'The following analytic detects instances of Winlogon.exe, a critical
  Windows process, connecting to public IP addresses. This behavior is identified
  using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on network connections
  made by Winlogon.exe. Under normal circumstances, Winlogon.exe should not connect
  to public IPs, and such activity may indicate a compromise, such as the BlackLotus
  bootkit attack. This detection is significant as it highlights potential system
  integrity breaches. If confirmed malicious, attackers could maintain persistence,
  bypass security measures, and compromise the system at a fundamental level.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present and filtering will be required.
  Legitimate IPs will be present and need to be filtered.
