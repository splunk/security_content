description: 'Monitor for signs that Ntdsutil is being used to Extract Active Directory
  database - NTDS.dit, typically used for offline password cracking. It may be used
  in normal circumstances with no command line arguments or shorthand variations of
  more common arguments. Ntdsutil.exe is typically seen run on a Windows Server. Typical
  command used to dump ntds.dit \

  ntdsutil "ac i ntds" "ifm" "create full C:\Temp" q q \

  This technique uses "Install from Media" (IFM), which will extract a copy of the
  Active Directory database. A successful export of the Active Directory database
  will yield a file modification named ntds.dit to the destination.'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=ntdsutil.exe
  Processes.process=*ntds* Processes.process=*create*) by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ntdsutil_export_ntds_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Highly possible Server Administrators will troubleshoot with
  ntdsutil.exe, generating false positives.
