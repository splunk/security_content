description: Awk is mostly used for processing and scanning patterns. 
  It checks one or more files to determine whether any lines fit the specified patterns, 
  and if so, it does the appropriate action. If sudo right is given to AWK binary for the user, then the user 
  can run system commands as root and possibly get a root shell.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*sudo*" AND Processes.process="*awk*"  AND Processes.process="*BEGIN*system*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_awk_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system administrative usage. Filter as needed.
