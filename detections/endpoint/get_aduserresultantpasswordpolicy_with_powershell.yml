description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` running
  the `Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy` cmdlet, which is used to obtain the password
  policy in a Windows domain. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity
  is significant as it indicates potential enumeration of domain policies, a common
  tactic for situational awareness and Active Directory discovery by adversaries.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to understand password policies,
  aiding in further attacks such as password spraying or brute force attempts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
