description: The following analytic detects the execution of a suspicious `bcdedit`
  command that reconfigures a host from safe mode back to normal boot. This detection
  leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on command-line executions
  involving `bcdedit.exe` with specific parameters. This activity is significant as
  it may indicate the presence of ransomware, such as BlackMatter, which manipulates
  boot configurations to facilitate encryption processes. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to maintain control over the boot process, potentially
  leading to further system compromise and data encryption.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
