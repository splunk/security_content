description: 'The following analytic identifies a single source endpoint failing to
  authenticate with 30 unique valid users using the NTLM protocol. It leverages EventCode
  4776 from Domain Controller logs, focusing on error code 0xC000006A, which indicates
  a bad password. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying
  attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
  information or further compromise of the Active Directory environment.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Credential
  Validation` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid domain users
  is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
  If this detection triggers on a host other than a Domain Controller, the behavior
  could represent a password spraying attack against the host's local accounts.
