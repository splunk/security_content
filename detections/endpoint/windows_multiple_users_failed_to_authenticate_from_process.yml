- Windows Event Log Security 4625
date: '2024-09-30'
description: The following analytic detects a source process failing to authenticate with 30 unique users, indicating a potential Password Spraying attack. It leverages Windows Event 4625 with Logon Type 2, collected from domain controllers, member servers, and workstations. This activity is significant as it may represent an adversary attempting to gain initial access or elevate privileges within an Active Directory environment. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or further compromise of the network, posing a severe security risk.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Event Logs from domain controllers aas well as member servers and workstations. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A process failing to authenticate with multiple users is not a common behavior for legitimate user sessions. Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
