- Endpoint
description: The following detection identifies control.exe loading either a .cpl
  or .inf from a writable directory. This is related to CVE-2021-40444. During triage,
  review parallel processes, parent and child, for further suspicious behaviors. In
  addition, capture file modifications and analyze.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=control.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=CONTROL.EXE) AND Processes.process IN ("*\\appdata\\*",
  "*\\windows\\temp\\*", "*\\programdata\\*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.original_file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `control_loading_from_world_writable_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives will be present as control.exe does
  not natively load from writable paths as defined. One may add .cpl or .inf to the
  command-line if there is any false positives. Tune as needed.
