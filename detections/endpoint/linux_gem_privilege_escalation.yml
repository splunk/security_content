description: The following analytic detects the execution of the RubyGems utility
  with elevated privileges, specifically when it is used to run system commands as
  root. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on command-line executions that include "gem open -e" and "sudo". This
  activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt,
  allowing a user to execute commands as the root user. If confirmed malicious, this
  could lead to full system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain root access
  and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*gem*open*-e*"
  AND Processes.process="*-c*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_gem_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
