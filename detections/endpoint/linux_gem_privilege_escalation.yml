description: RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that
  provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained
  format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems,
  and a server for distributing them. If sudo right is given to GEM utility for the
  user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*gem*open*-e*"
  AND Processes.process="*-c*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_gem_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
