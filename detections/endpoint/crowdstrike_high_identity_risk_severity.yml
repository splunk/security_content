description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for High Identity Risk Severity with a risk score of 70 or higher. These alerts indicate significant vulnerabilities in user identities, such as suspicious behavior or compromised credentials. Promptly investigating and addressing these alerts is crucial to prevent potential security breaches and ensure the integrity and protection of sensitive information and systems.

how_to_implement: To implement crowdstrike:identities logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "crowdstrike:identities" event stream. Process and store the logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.
