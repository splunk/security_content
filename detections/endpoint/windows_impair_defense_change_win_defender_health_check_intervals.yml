description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that change the health check interval of Windows Defender. It leverages data from
  the Endpoint datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to the "ServiceKeepAlive"
  registry path with a value of "0x00000001". This activity is significant because
  altering Windows Defender settings can impair its ability to perform timely health
  checks, potentially leaving the system vulnerable. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow an attacker to disable or delay security scans, increasing the risk
  of undetected malware or other malicious activities.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\ServiceKeepAlive" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001" by Registry.registry_key_name
  Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action
  Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_change_win_defender_health_check_intervals_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
