description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to change the health check interval of Windows Defender.
  Specifically, a value of 1 typically signifies that Windows Defender would perform health checks at a much higher frequency than the default settings. 
  However, it's important to note that modifying this value to 1 might not necessarily conform to the actual behavior, as certain registry settings may 
  have specific accepted values or a defined range that differs from a simple binary representation.
  Changing registry values, especially those related to system services, should be approached cautiously. 
  Incorrect modifications can potentially impact system stability or performance. Always ensure you understand the implications and 
  have a backup before altering registry settings.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows Defender\\ServiceKeepAlive"

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
