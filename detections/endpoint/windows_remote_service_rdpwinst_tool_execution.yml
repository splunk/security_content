description: The following analytic identifies RDPWInst.exe tool, which is a RDP wrapper
  library tool designed to enable remote desktop host support and concurrent RDP session
  on reduced functionality system. Unfortunately, this open project was abused by
  adversaries to enable RDP connection to the targeted host for remote access and
  potentially be for lateral movement.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name="RDPWInst.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name="RDPWInst.exe")
  AND Processes.process IN ("* -i*", "* -s*", "* -o*", "* -w*", "* -r*") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_service_rdpwinst_tool_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This tool was designed for home usage and not commonly seen
  in production environment. Filter as needed.
