description: The following analytic detects the execution of the RDPWInst.exe tool,
  which is an RDP wrapper library used to enable remote desktop host support and concurrent
  RDP sessions. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, original file names, and specific command-line
  arguments. This activity is significant because adversaries can abuse this tool
  to establish unauthorized RDP connections, facilitating remote access and potential
  lateral movement within the network. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and further compromise of the targeted host.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name="RDPWInst.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name="RDPWInst.exe")
  AND Processes.process IN ("* -i*", "* -s*", "* -o*", "* -w*", "* -r*") by Processes.dest

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_service_rdpwinst_tool_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This tool was designed for home usage and not commonly seen
  in production environment. Filter as needed.
