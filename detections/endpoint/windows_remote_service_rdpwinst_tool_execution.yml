description: The following analytic identifies RDPWInst.exe tool, which is a RDP wrapper
  library tool designed to enable remote desktop host support and concurrent RDP session
  on reduced functionality system. Unfortunately, this open project was abused by
  adversaries to enable RDP connection to the targeted host for remote access and
  potentially be for lateral movement.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name="RDPWInst.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name="RDPWInst.exe")
  AND Processes.process IN ("* -i*", "* -s*", "* -o*", "* -w*", "* -r*") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_service_rdpwinst_tool_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: This tool was designed for home usage and not commonly seen
  in production environment. Filter as needed.
