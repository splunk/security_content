description: "This search looks for executions of cmd.exe spawned by a process that
is often abused by attackers and that does not typically launch cmd.exe.
This is a SPL2 implementation of the rule `Detect Prohibited Applications Spawning cmd.exe` by @bpatel."
how_to_implement: "You must be ingesting sysmon logs. 
This search has been modified to process raw sysmon data from attack_range's nxlogs on DSP."

eli5: "Obtaining access to the Command-Line Interface (CLI) is typically a primary
         attacker goal. Once an attacker has obtained the ability to execute code on a target
         system, they will often further manipulate the system via commands passed to the
         CLI. It is also unusual for many applications to spawn a command shell during normal
         operation, while it is often observed if an application has been compromised in
         some way. As such, it is often beneficial to look for cmd.exe being executed by
         processes that are often targeted for exploitation, or that would not spawn cmd.exe
         in any other circumstances. A lookup file is provided to easily modify the processes
         that are being watched for execution of cmd.exe."
known_false_positives: "There are circumstances where an application may legitimately
                          execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface. Investigate and modify
                          the lookup file, as appropriate."
