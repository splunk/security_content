type: Hunting
description: The following analytic identifies drivers being loaded across the fleet.
  It leverages a PowerShell script input deployed to critical systems to capture driver
  data. This detection is significant as it helps monitor for unauthorized or malicious
  drivers that could compromise system integrity. If confirmed malicious, such drivers
  could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain
  persistence within the environment.
data_source: []
search: '`driverinventory` | stats values(Path) min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime count by host DriverType | rename host as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_driver_inventory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To capture the drivers by host, utilize the referenced Gist to create
  the inputs, props and transforms. Otherwise, this hunt query will not work.
known_false_positives: Filter and modify the analytic as you'd like. Filter based
  on path. Remove the system32\drivers and look for non-standard paths.
