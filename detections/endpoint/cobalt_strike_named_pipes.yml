description: 'The following analytic detects the use of default or publicly known
  named pipes associated with Cobalt Strike. It leverages Sysmon EventID 17 and 18
  to identify specific named pipes commonly used by Cobalt Strike''s Artifact Kit
  and Malleable C2 Profiles. This activity is significant because Cobalt Strike is
  a popular tool for adversaries to conduct post-exploitation tasks, and identifying
  its named pipes can reveal potential malicious activity. If confirmed malicious,
  this could indicate an active Cobalt Strike beacon, leading to unauthorized access,
  data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network.'
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 17
- Sysmon EventID 18
search: '`sysmon` EventID=17 OR EventID=18 PipeName IN (\\msagent_*, \\DserNamePipe*,
  \\srvsvc_*, \\postex_*, \\status_*, \\MSSE-*, \\spoolss_*, \\win_svc*, \\ntsvcs*,
  \\winsock*, \\UIA_PIPE*)  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by dest, process_name, process_id process_path, PipeName | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `cobalt_strike_named_pipes_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: The idea of using named pipes with Cobalt Strike is to blend
  in. Therefore, some of the named pipes identified and added may cause false positives.
  Filter by process name or pipe name to reduce false positives.
