description: The following analytic identifies `wmic.exe` loading a remote XSL (eXtensible
  Stylesheet Language) script. This originally was identified by Casey Smith, dubbed
  Squiblytwo, as an application control bypass. Many adversaries will utilize this
  technique to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file. This technique can also
  execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its Regsvr32 "Squiblydoo" counterpart,
  leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in Windows
  Management Instrumentation provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch. Upon identifying
  a suspicious execution, review for confirmed network connnection and script download.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` Processes.process
  IN ("*http://*", "*https://*") Processes.process="*/format:*" by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id
  Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wmic_xsl_execution_via_url_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives are limited as legitimate applications typically
  do not download files or xsl using WMIC. Filter as needed.
