description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry key for setting up a proxy server. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, focusing on changes to the "Internet Settings\\ProxyServer" registry path. This activity is significant as it can indicate malware or adversaries configuring a proxy to facilitate unauthorized communication with Command and Control (C2) servers. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to establish persistent, covert channels for data exfiltration or further exploitation of the compromised host.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path = "*\\Internet Settings\\ProxyServer" by  Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid Registry.action Registry.user Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | where isnotnull(registry_value_data) | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_proxyserver_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
