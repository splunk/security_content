description: The following analytic identifies an excessive number of taskhost.exe and taskhostex.exe processes running within a short time frame. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and their counts. This behavior is significant as it is commonly associated with post-exploitation tools like Meterpreter and Koadic, which use multiple instances of these processes for actions such as discovery and lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an ongoing attack, allowing attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, or move laterally within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators, administrative actions or certain applications may run many instances of taskhost and taskhostex concurrently.  Filter as needed.
