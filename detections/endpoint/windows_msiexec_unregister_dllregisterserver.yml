description: The following analytic detects the use of msiexec.exe with the /z switch
  parameter, which is used to unload DLLRegisterServer. This detection leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution
  logs, including command-line arguments. This activity is significant because unloading
  DLLRegisterServer can be indicative of an attempt to deregister a DLL, potentially
  disrupting legitimate services or hiding malicious activity. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to disable security controls, evade detection, or disrupt
  system functionality, leading to further compromise of the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_msiexec` Processes.process
  IN ("*/z*", "*-z*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_msiexec_unregister_dllregisterserver_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This analytic will need to be tuned for your environment based
  on legitimate usage of msiexec.exe. Filter as needed.
