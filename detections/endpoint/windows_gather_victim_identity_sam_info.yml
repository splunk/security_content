description: The following analytic identifies a process that loads the samlib.dll
  module. This module is being abused by adversaries, threat actors and red teamers
  to access information of SAM objects or access credentials information in DC. This
  hunting query can be a good indicator that a process is capable of accessing the
  SAM object.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  (ImageLoaded = "*\\samlib.dll" AND OriginalFileName
  = "samlib.dll") OR (ImageLoaded = "*\\samcli.dll" AND OriginalFileName = "SAMCLI.DLL")
  AND NOT (Image IN("C:\\Windows\\*", "C:\\Program File*", "%systemroot%\\*")) | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded process_name
  dest EventCode Signed ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_gather_victim_identity_sam_info_filter`'
how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
  will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to
  work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
known_false_positives: this module can be loaded by a third party application. Filter
  is needed.
