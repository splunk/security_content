description: The following analytic detects processes loading the samlib.dll or samcli.dll
  modules, which are often abused to access Security Account Manager (SAM) objects
  or credentials on domain controllers. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode
  7 to identify these DLLs being loaded outside typical system directories. Monitoring
  this activity is crucial as it may indicate attempts to gather sensitive identity
  information. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to obtain
  credentials, escalate privileges, or further infiltrate the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  (ImageLoaded = "*\\samlib.dll" AND OriginalFileName
  = "samlib.dll") OR (ImageLoaded = "*\\samcli.dll" AND OriginalFileName = "SAMCLI.DLL")
  AND NOT (Image IN("C:\\Windows\\*", "C:\\Program File*", "%systemroot%\\*")) | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded process_name
  dest EventCode Signed ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_gather_victim_identity_sam_info_filter`'
how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
  will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to
  work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
known_false_positives: this module can be loaded by a third party application. Filter
  is needed.
