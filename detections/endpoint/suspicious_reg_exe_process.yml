description: This search looks for reg.exe being launched from a command prompt not
  started by the user. When a user launches cmd.exe, the parent process is usually
  explorer.exe. This search filters out those instances.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It's possible for system administrators to write scripts that
  exhibit this behavior. If this is the case, the search will need to be modified
  to filter them out.
