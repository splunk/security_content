description: This search looks for reg.exe being launched from a command prompt not
  started by the user. When a user launches cmd.exe, the parent process is usually
  explorer.exe. This search filters out those instances.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
known_false_positives: It's possible for system administrators to write scripts that
  exhibit this behavior. If this is the case, the search will need to be modified
  to filter them out.
