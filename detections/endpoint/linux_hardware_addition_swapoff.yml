description: This analytic looks for process execution to disable the swapping of
  paging devices. This technique was seen in Awfulshred malware that disables the
  swapping of the specified devices and files. This anomaly detection can be a good
  indicator that a process or a user tries to disable this Linux feature in a targeted
  host.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "swapoff"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_hardware_addition_swapoff_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: administrator may disable swapping of devices in a linux host.
  Filter is needed.
