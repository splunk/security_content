description: The following analytic detects suspicious modifications to system firewall
  rules, specifically allowing execution of applications from notable and potentially
  malicious file paths. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving firewall rule
  changes. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting
  to bypass firewall restrictions to execute malicious files. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to execute unauthorized code, potentially leading to
  further system compromise, data exfiltration, or persistence within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may utilize an
  automated or manual execution of this firewall rule that may generate false positives.
  Filter as needed.
