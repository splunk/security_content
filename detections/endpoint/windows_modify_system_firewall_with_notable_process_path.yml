description: The following analytic detects a potential suspicious modification of firewall
  rule allowing to execute specific application in public and suspicious windows process file path. This technique was identified when
  an adversary and red teams to bypassed firewall file execution restriction in a
  targetted host. Take note that this event or command can run by administrator during
  testing or allowing legitimate tool or application.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may utilize an
  automated or manual execution of this firewall rule that may generate false positives.
  Filter as needed.
