description: The following analytics identifies the resizing of shadowstorage by ransomware
  malware to avoid the shadow volumes being made again. this technique is an alternative
  by ransomware attacker than deleting the shadowstorage which is known alert in defensive
  team. one example of ransomware that use this technique is CLOP ransomware where
  it drops a .bat file that will resize the shadowstorage to minimum size as much
  as possible

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network admin can resize the shadowstorage for valid purposes.
