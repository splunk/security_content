description: 'The following analytic detects the creation of suspicious scheduled
  tasks in Windows, specifically tasks created using schtasks.exe with the -create
  flag and an XML parameter in the command-line. This technique is commonly employed
  by threat actors, adversaries, and red teamers to establish persistence or achieve
  privilege escalation on targeted hosts. Notably, malware like Trickbot and Winter-Vivern
  have been observed using XML files to create scheduled tasks. Monitoring and investigating
  this activity is crucial to mitigate potential security risks. It is important to
  be aware that scripts or administrators may trigger this analytic, leading to potential
  false positives. To minimize false positives, adjust the filter based on the parent
  process or application.

  When a true positive is detected, it suggests an attacker''s attempt to gain persistence
  or execute additional malicious payloads, potentially resulting in data theft, ransomware,
  or other damaging outcomes. During triage, review the source of the scheduled task,
  the command to be executed, and capture any relevant on-disk artifacts. Analyze
  concurrent processes to identify the source of the attack. This analytic enables
  analysts to detect and respond to potential threats early, mitigating the associated
  risks effectively.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible scripts or administrators may trigger this analytic.
  Filter as needed based on parent process, application.
