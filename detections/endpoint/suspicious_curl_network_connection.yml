description: The following analytic detects the use of the curl command contacting
  suspicious remote domains, such as s3.amazonaws.com, which is indicative of Command
  and Control (C2) activity or downloading further implants. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution
  logs and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  the presence of MacOS adware or other malicious software attempting to establish
  persistence or exfiltrate data. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to maintain control over the compromised system and deploy additional payloads.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Filter as needed.
