description: The following analytic detects the use of 'schtasks.exe' to start a Scheduled
  Task on a remote endpoint. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) data, focusing on process details such as process name, parent process, and
  command-line executions. This activity is significant as adversaries often abuse
  Task Scheduler for lateral movement and remote code execution. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially
  leading to further compromise of the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=schtasks.exe) (Processes.process=*/s* AND Processes.process=*/run*)
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `scheduled_task_initiation_on_remote_endpoint_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may start scheduled tasks on remote systems,
  but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
