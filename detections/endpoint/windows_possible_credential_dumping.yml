description: 'The following analytic detects potential credential dumping by identifying
  specific GrantedAccess permission requests and CallTrace DLLs targeting the LSASS
  process. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 10 logs, focusing on access requests to lsass.exe
  and call traces involving debug and native API DLLs like dbgcore.dll, dbghelp.dll,
  and ntdll.dll. This activity is significant as credential dumping can lead to unauthorized
  access to sensitive credentials. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain elevated
  privileges and persist within the environment, posing a severe security risk.'
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*\\lsass.exe granted_access IN ("0x01000",
  "0x1010", "0x1038", "0x40", "0x1400", "0x1fffff", "0x1410", "0x143a", "0x1438",
  "0x1000") CallTrace IN ("*dbgcore.dll*", "*dbghelp.dll*", "*ntdll.dll*", "*kernelbase.dll*",
  "*kernel32.dll*") NOT SourceUser IN ("NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM", "NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK
  SERVICE") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest,
  SourceImage, GrantedAccess, TargetImage, SourceProcessId, SourceUser, TargetUser
  | rename SourceUser as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_possible_credential_dumping_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Enabling EventCode 10 TargetProcess lsass.exe is required.
known_false_positives: False positives will occur based on GrantedAccess 0x1010 and
  0x1400, filter based on source image as needed or remove them. Concern is Cobalt
  Strike usage of Mimikatz will generate 0x1010 initially, but later be caught.
