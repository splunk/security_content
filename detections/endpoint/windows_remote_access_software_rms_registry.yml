description: The following analytic detects the creation or modification of Windows
  registry entries related to the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) Remote Admin tool.
  It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, focusing on registry paths
  containing "SYSTEM\\Remote Manipulator System." This activity is significant because
  RMS, while legitimate, is often abused by adversaries, such as in the Azorult malware
  campaigns, to gain unauthorized remote access. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow attackers to remotely control the targeted host, leading to potential data
  exfiltration, system manipulation, or further network compromise.

- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\SYSTEM\\Remote
  Manipulator System*" by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_access_software_rms_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
