description: Windows Active Directory contains numerous objects that grant elevated access to the domain they reside in. These objects should be rarely accessed by normal users or processes. Access attempts to one or more of these objects may be evidence of attacker enumeration of Active Directory.

how_to_implement: Enable Audit Directory Service Access via GPO and collect event code 4662. The required SACLs need to be created for the relevant objects. Be aware Splunk filters this event by default on the Windows TA.
known_false_positives: Service accounts or applications that routinely query Active Directory for information.
