description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  specifically targeting the "WppTracingLevel" setting within Windows Defender. This
  detection leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model to identify changes
  in the registry path associated with Windows Defender tracing levels. Such modifications
  are significant as they can impair the diagnostic capabilities of Windows Defender,
  potentially hiding malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  allow an attacker to evade detection and maintain persistence within the environment,
  leading to further compromise and data exfiltration.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\Reporting\\WppTracingLevel" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001"
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_change_win_defender_tracing_level_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
