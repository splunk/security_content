description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry specifically targeting the "WppTracingLevel" setting within Windows Defender. This detection leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model to identify changes in the registry path associated with Windows Defender tracing levels. Such modifications are significant as they can impair the diagnostic capabilities of Windows Defender, potentially hiding malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to evade detection and maintain persistence within the environment, leading to further compromise and data exfiltration.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows Defender\\Reporting\\WppTracingLevel" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001" by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_change_win_defender_tracing_level_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro to tune the search.
