  configuration discovery on the endpoint.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records registry activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the processes node. This is typically
  populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black, or
  endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is usually
  generated via logs that report reads and writes to the registry or that are populated
  via Windows event logs, after enabling process tracking in your Windows audit settings.
known_false_positives: It is uncommon for normal users to execute a series of commands
  used for network discovery. System administrators often use scripts to execute these
  commands. These can generate false positives.
