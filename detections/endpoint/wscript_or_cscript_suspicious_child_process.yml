description: This analytic identifies a suspicious spawned process by WScript or CScript
  process. This technique was a common technique used by adversaries and malware to
  execute different LOLBIN, other scripts like PowerShell or spawn a suspended process
  to inject its code as a defense evasion. This TTP may detect some normal script
  that using several application tool that are in the list of the child process it
  detects but a good pivot and indicator that a script is may execute suspicious code.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("cscript.exe", "wscript.exe") Processes.process_name IN ("regsvr32.exe", "rundll32.exe","winhlp32.exe","certutil.exe","msbuild.exe","cmd.exe","powershell*","wmic.exe","mshta.exe")

  | `wscript_or_cscript_suspicious_child_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Administrators may create vbs or js script that use several
  tool as part of its execution. Filter as needed.
