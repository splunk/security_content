description: The following analytic leverages Event ID 4104 to identify the execution of the PowerView powershell commandlets `Get-ObjectAcl` or `Get-DomainObjectAcl`. This commandlets
  are used to enumerate Access Control List permissions given to Active Directory objects. In an active directory environment, an object is an entity that represents an available resource within 
  the organizations network, such as domain controllers, users, groups, computers, shares, etc.  Maintaining Active Directory permissions is complicated and hard to manage, especially in complex 
  and large environments with multiple domains. Weak permissions may allow adversaries and red teamers to escalate their privileges in Active Directory. PowerView is a common tool leveraged
  by attackers to identify and exploit configuration weaknesses.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.=
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerView for legitimate purposes, filter as needed.
