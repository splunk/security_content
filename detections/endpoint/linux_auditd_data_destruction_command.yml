description: The following analytic detects the execution of a Unix shell command
  designed to wipe root directories on a Linux host. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on the 'rm' command with force recursive deletion and the '--no-preserve-root' option. This activity is significant as it
  indicates potential data destruction attempts, often associated with malware like
  Awfulshred. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to severe data loss,
  system instability, and compromised integrity of the affected Linux host. Immediate
  investigation and response are crucial to mitigate potential damage.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_execve_process` | rename host as
  dest | where LIKE (process_exec, "%rm %") AND LIKE (process_exec, "% -rf %") AND
  LIKE (process_exec, "%--no-preserve-root%") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by argc process_exec dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_data_destruction_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
