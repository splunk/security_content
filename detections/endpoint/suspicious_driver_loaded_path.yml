description: This analytic will detect suspicious driver loaded paths. This technique
  is commonly used by malicious software like coin miners (xmrig) to register its
  malicious driver from notable directories where executable or drivers do not commonly
  exist. During triage, validate this driver is for legitimate business use. Review
  the metadata and certificate information. Unsigned drivers from non-standard paths
  is not normal, but occurs. In addition, review driver loads into `ntoskrnl.exe`
  for possible other drivers of interest. Long tail analyze drivers by path (outside
  of default, and in default) for further review.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=6 ImageLoaded = "*.sys" NOT (ImageLoaded IN("*\\WINDOWS\\inf","*\\WINDOWS\\System32\\drivers\\*",
  "*\\WINDOWS\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\*")) |  stats  min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Computer ImageLoaded Hashes IMPHASH Signature
  Signed | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_driver_loaded_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the driver loaded and Signature from your endpoints. If you are using
  Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives will be present. Some applications
  do load drivers
