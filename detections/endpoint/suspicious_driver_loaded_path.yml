description: The following analytic detects the loading of drivers from suspicious
  paths, which is a technique often used by malicious software such as coin miners
  (e.g., xmrig). It leverages Sysmon EventCode 6 to identify drivers loaded from non-standard
  directories. This activity is significant because legitimate drivers typically reside
  in specific system directories, and deviations may indicate malicious activity.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute code at the kernel
  level, potentially leading to privilege escalation, persistence, or further system
  compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 6
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=6 ImageLoaded = "*.sys" NOT (ImageLoaded IN("*\\WINDOWS\\inf","*\\WINDOWS\\System32\\drivers\\*",
  "*\\WINDOWS\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\*")) |  stats  min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by dest ImageLoaded Hashes IMPHASH Signature
  Signed| rename ImageLoaded as file_name | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_driver_loaded_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the driver loaded and Signature from your endpoints. If you are using
  Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives will be present. Some applications
  do load drivers
