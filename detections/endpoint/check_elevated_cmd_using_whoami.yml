description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the 'whoami' command
  with specific parameters to check for elevated privileges. It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and command-line
  telemetry. This activity is significant because it is commonly used by attackers,
  such as FIN7, to perform reconnaissance on a compromised host. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could indicate an attacker is assessing their privilege level, potentially
  leading to further privilege escalation or persistence within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process = "*whoami*"
  Processes.process = "*/group*" Processes.process = "* find *" Processes.process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
