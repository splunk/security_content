type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious whoami execution to check if the
  cmd or shell instance process is with elevated privileges. This technique was seen
  in FIN7 js implant where it execute this as part of its data collection to the infected
  machine to check if the running shell cmd process is elevated or not. This TTP is
  really a good alert for known attacker that recon on the targetted host. This command
  is not so commonly executed by a normal user or even an admin to check if a process
  is elevated.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process = "*whoami*"
  Processes.process = "*/group*" Processes.process = "* find *" Processes.process
  = "*12288*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `check_elevated_cmd_using_whoami_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
