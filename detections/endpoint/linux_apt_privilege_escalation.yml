description: The following analytic detects the use of the Advanced Package Tool (APT) with elevated privileges via sudo on Linux systems. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry to identify processes where APT commands are executed with sudo rights. This activity is significant because it indicates a user can run system commands as root, potentially leading to unauthorized root shell access. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary commands, and gain full control over the affected system, posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*apt*" AND Processes.process="*APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_apt_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
