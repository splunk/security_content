description: The following analytic detects the deletion of Linux service unit configuration
  files by suspicious processes. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  telemetry, focusing on processes executing the 'rm' command targeting '.service'
  files. This activity is significant as it may indicate malware attempting to disable
  critical services or security products, a common defense evasion tactic. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to service disruption, security tool incapacitation,
  or complete system compromise, severely impacting the integrity and availability
  of the affected Linux host.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "rm"  AND
  Processes.process = "*rm *"  AND Processes.process = "*.service" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_indicator_removal_service_file_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network admin can delete services unit configuration file as
  part of normal software installation. Filter is needed.
