description: This analytic looks for suspicious linux processes that delete service unit configuration files. 
  This technique was seen in several malware to delete service configuration files to corrupt a services or security product as part of its defense evasion. 
  This TTP detection can be a good indicator of possible malware try to kill several services or a wiper like AwfulShred shell script that wipes the 
  targeted linux host
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name = "rm"  AND Processes.process = "*rm *"  AND Processes.process = "*.service"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id 
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `linux_indicator_removal_service_file_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: network admin can delete services unit configuration file as part of normal software installation. Filter is needed.
