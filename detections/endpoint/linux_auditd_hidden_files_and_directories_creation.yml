description: "The following analytic detects suspicious creation of hidden files and
  directories, which may indicate an attacker's attempt to conceal malicious activities
  or unauthorized data. Hidden files and directories are often used to evade detection
  by security tools and administrators, providing a stealthy means for storing malware,
  logs, or sensitive information. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized creation of
  hidden files and directories, this analytic helps identify potential attempts to hide
  or unauthorized creation of hidden files and directories, this analytic helps identify
  potential attempts to hide malicious operations, enabling security teams to uncover
  and address hidden threats effectively."

how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
