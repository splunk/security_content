- Endpoint
description: The following hunting analytic identifies the use of `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group`
  being used with PowerShell to identify local groups on the endpoint. \ Typically,
  by itself, is not malicious but may raise suspicion based on time of day, endpoint
  and username. \ During triage, review parallel processes and identify any further
  suspicious behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=powershell.exe
  OR processes.process_name=cmd.exe) (Processes.process="*Get-WMIObject*" AND Processes.process="*Win32_Group*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`  |
  `get_wmiobject_group_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune as needed.
