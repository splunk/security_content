description: The following analytic detects the use of the `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group`
  command executed via PowerShell to enumerate local groups on an endpoint. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  names and command-line executions. Identifying local groups can be a precursor to
  privilege escalation or lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow an attacker to map out group memberships, aiding in further exploitation
  or unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=powershell.exe
  OR processes.process_name=cmd.exe) (Processes.process="*Get-WMIObject*" AND Processes.process="*Win32_Group*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

  `get_wmiobject_group_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune as needed.
