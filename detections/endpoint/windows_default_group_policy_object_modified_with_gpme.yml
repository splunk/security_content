description: The following analytic detects modifications to default Group Policy
  Objects (GPOs) using the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME). It leverages the
  Endpoint data model to identify processes where `mmc.exe` executes `gpme.msc` with
  specific GUIDs related to default GPOs. This activity is significant because default
  GPOs, such as the `Default Domain Controllers Policy` and `Default Domain Policy`,
  are critical for enforcing security policies across the domain. If malicious, such
  modifications could allow an attacker to gain further access, establish persistence,
  or deploy malware across numerous hosts, severely compromising the network's security.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=mmc.exe
  (Processes.process =*gpme.msc*) AND (Processes.process = "*31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9*"
  OR Processes.process = "*6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04fB984F9*"  ) by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_default_group_policy_object_modified_with_gpme_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: The default Group Policy Objects within an AD network may be
  legitimately updated for administrative operations, filter as needed.
