description: This analytic look for a spawned runas.exe process with a administrator
  user option parameter. This parameter was abused by adversaries, malware author
  or even red teams to gain elevated privileges in target host. This is a good hunting
  query to figure out privilege escalation tactics that may used for different stages
  like lateral movement but take note that administrator may use this command in purpose
  so its better to see other event context before and after this analytic.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_runas` AND Processes.process
  = "*/user:*" AND Processes.process = "*admin*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `runas_execution_in_commandline_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may utilize an
  automated or manual execute this command that may generate false positives. filter
  is needed.
