description: The following analytic identifies a process command line related to the discovery of possible Security Support Providers in the registry. 
  This technique is being abused by adversaries or post exploitation tools like winpeas to gather LSA protection and configuration in the registry in the targeted host. 
  This registry entry can contain several information related to LSA that validates users for local and remote sign-ins and enforces local security policies.
  Understanding LSA protection may give a good information in accessing LSA content in memory which is commonly attack by adversaries and tool like mimikatz to 
  scrape password hashes or clear plain text passwords.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_reg` AND Processes.process = "* query *" AND Processes.process = "*\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA*" Processes.process IN ("*RunAsPPL*" , "*LsaCfgFlags*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid 
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_security_support_provider_reg_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
