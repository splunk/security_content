description: The following analytic identifies command-line activity querying the
  registry for Security Support Providers (SSPs) related to Local Security Authority
  (LSA) protection and configuration. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on processes accessing specific LSA registry
  paths. Monitoring this activity is crucial as adversaries and post-exploitation
  tools like winpeas may use it to gather information on LSA protections, potentially
  leading to credential theft. If confirmed malicious, attackers could exploit this
  to scrape password hashes or plaintext passwords from memory, significantly compromising
  system security.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_reg` AND Processes.process
  = "* query *" AND Processes.process = "*\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA*"
  Processes.process IN ("*RunAsPPL*" , "*LsaCfgFlags*") by Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_security_support_provider_reg_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
