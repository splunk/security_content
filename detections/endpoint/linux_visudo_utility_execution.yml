type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to looks for suspicious commandline that add entry to
  /etc/sudoers by using visudo utility tool in linux platform. This technique may
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain elevated privilege
  to targeted or compromised host. /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what commands
  as what users on what machines and can also control special things such as whether
  you need a password for particular commands. The file is composed of aliases (basically
  variables) and user specifications (which control who can run what).
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = visudo
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_visudo_utility_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
