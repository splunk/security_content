description: This analytic is to look for possible execution of SysReq hack to enable
  all functions of kernel system requests of the Linux system host. This technique
  was seen in AwfulShred malware wiper to reboot the compromised host by using the
  linux magic sysreq key. This kernel configuration can be triggered by piping out
  bitmask '1' to /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq. This TTP detection can be a good indicator
  of possible suspicious processes running on the Linux host since this command is
  not so common shell commandline.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN ("dash",
  "sudo", "bash")  Processes.process =  "* echo 1 &gt; *" Processes.process = "*/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_unix_shell_enable_all_sysrq_functions_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
