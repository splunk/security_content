description: 'The following analytic detects the usage of specific Exchange PowerShell
  modules, such as New-MailboxExportRequest, New-ManagementRoleAssignment, New-MailboxSearch,
  and Get-Recipient. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104)
  to identify these commands. This activity is significant because these modules can
  be exploited by adversaries who have gained access via ProxyShell or ProxyNotShell
  vulnerabilities. If confirmed malicious, attackers could export mailbox contents,
  assign management roles, conduct mailbox searches, or view recipient objects, potentially
  leading to data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access to sensitive
  information.'
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN ("*New-MailboxExportRequest*",
  "*New-ManagementRoleAssignment*", "*New-MailboxSearch*", "*Get-Recipient*", "Search-Mailbox")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Opcode Computer
  UserID EventCode ScriptBlockText | rename Computer as dest |rename UserID as user
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `exchange_powershell_module_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this PowerShell commandlet
  for troubleshooting.
