author: Shannon Davis, Splunk
status: experimental
type: TTP
description: |-
  The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the Baron Samedit vulnerability (CVE-2021-3156) by identifying the use of the "sudoedit -s \\" command. This detection leverages logs from Linux systems, specifically searching for instances of the sudoedit command with the "-s" flag followed by a double quote. This activity is significant because it indicates an attempt to exploit a known vulnerability that allows attackers to gain root privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to complete system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and potential data breaches.
data_source: []
search: '`linux_hosts` "sudoedit -s \\" | `detect_baron_samedit_cve_2021_3156_filter`'
how_to_implement: Splunk Universal Forwarder running on Linux systems, capturing logs
  from the /var/log directory. The vulnerability is exposed when a non privledged
  user tries passing in a single \ character at the end of the command while using
  the shell and edit flags.
