description: The following analytic identifies the loading of the malicious SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll
  by SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe and subsequent DNS queries to avsvmcloud.com.
  It uses Sysmon EventID 7 for DLL loading and Event ID 22 for DNS queries, correlating
  these events within a 12-14 day period. This activity is significant as it indicates
  potential Sunburst malware infection, a known supply chain attack. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized network access, data exfiltration, and
  further compromise of the affected systems.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '(`sysmon` EventCode=7 ImageLoaded=*SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll)
  OR (`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName=*avsvmcloud.com) | eventstats dc(EventCode)
  AS dc_events | where dc_events=2 | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  values(ImageLoaded) AS ImageLoaded values(QueryName) AS QueryName by host | rename
  host as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `sunburst_correlation_dll_and_network_event_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 7, Driver
  loaded. Please tune your sysmon config that you DriverLoad event for SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll
  is captured by Sysmon. Additionally, you need sysmon logs for Event ID 22, DNS Query.
  We suggest to run this detection at least once a day over the last 14 days.
