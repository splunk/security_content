description: The following analytic identifies the execution of RAR utilities to archive
  files on a system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names, GUIDs, and command-line arguments. This activity
  is significant as threat actors, including red-teamers and malware like DarkGate,
  use RAR archiving to compress and exfiltrate collected data from compromised hosts.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to the unauthorized transfer of
  sensitive information to command and control servers, posing a severe risk to data
  confidentiality and integrity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
