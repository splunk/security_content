description: The following analytic identifies a process execute a rar utilities to archive files. 
  This method has been exploited by various threat actors, including red-teamers and malware like DarkGate, 
  to gather and compress collected data on compromised hosts. Subsequently, these archives are transmitted to 
  command and control servers as part of their data exfiltration techniques.
  These adversaries leverage RAR archiving to consolidate and compress collected data on compromised hosts. 
  Once the data is compiled into these archives, it serves as a means for these entities to effectively exfiltrate sensitive information. 
  This process involves transferring the archived data to command and control servers, 
  facilitating the extraction and retrieval of critical information from compromised systems.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
