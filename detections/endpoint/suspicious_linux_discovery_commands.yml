description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of suspicious bash commands
  commonly used in scripts like AutoSUID, LinEnum, and LinPeas for system discovery
  on a Linux host. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, specifically
  looking for a high number of distinct commands executed within a short time frame.
  This activity is significant as it often precedes privilege escalation or other
  malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain detailed system
  information, identify vulnerabilities, and potentially escalate privileges, posing
  a severe threat to the environment.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Unless an administrator is using these commands to troubleshoot
  or audit a system, the execution of these commands should be monitored.
