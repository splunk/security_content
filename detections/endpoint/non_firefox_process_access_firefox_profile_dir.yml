description: This search is to detect an anomaly event of a non-firefox process accessing
  the files in the profile folder. This folder contains all the sqlite database of
  the firefox browser related to users login, history, cookies and etc. Most of the
  RAT, trojan spy as well as FIN7 jssloader try to parse the those sqlite database
  to collect information on the compromised host. This SACL Event (4663) needs to
  be enabled to the firefox profile directory to use this. Since this is monitoring
  the access to the folder, we have obsevered noise and hence added `sqlite db browser`
  and `explorer.exe` to make this detection more stable.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4663
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 NOT (process_name IN ("*\\firefox.exe",
  "*\\explorer.exe", "*sql*")) Object_Name="*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles*"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Object_Name Object_Type
  process_name Access_Mask Accesses process_id EventCode dest user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `non_firefox_process_access_firefox_profile_dir_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: other browser not listed related to firefox may catch by this
  rule.
