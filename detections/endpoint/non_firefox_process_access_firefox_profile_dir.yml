description: The following analytic detects non-Firefox processes accessing the Firefox
  profile directory, which contains sensitive user data such as login credentials,
  browsing history, and cookies. It leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically
  event code 4663, to monitor access attempts. This activity is significant because
  it may indicate attempts by malware, such as RATs or trojans, to harvest user information.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized
  access to user accounts, and further compromise of the affected system.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4663
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 NOT (ProcessName IN ("*\\firefox.exe",
  "*\\explorer.exe", "*sql*")) ObjectName="*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles*"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ObjectName ObjectType
  ProcessName AccessMask EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `non_firefox_process_access_firefox_profile_dir_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: other browser not listed related to firefox may catch by this
  rule.
