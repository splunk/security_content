description: The following analytic identifies modifications to the registry path
  .wav\\OpenWithProgIds, associated with the Snake Malware campaign. It leverages
  data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel to detect changes in this specific registry
  location. This activity is significant because Snake's WerFault.exe uses this registry
  path to decrypt an encrypted blob containing critical components like the AES key,
  IV, and paths for its kernel driver and loader. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow the attacker to load and execute Snake's kernel driver, leading to potential
  system compromise and persistent access.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Registry.registry_key_name)
  as registry_key_name values(Registry.registry_path) as registry_path min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path="*\\.wav\\OpenWithProgIds\\*"  by
  Registry.dest  Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name

  | `windows_snake_malware_registry_modification_wav_openwithprogids_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and will require tuning based
  on program Ids in large organizations.
