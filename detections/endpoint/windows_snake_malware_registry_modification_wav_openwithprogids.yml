description: The follow analytic identifies the registry being modified at .wav\\OpenWithProgIds\, which is related to the Snake Malware campaign. Upon execution, Snake's WerFault.exe will attempt to decrypt an encrypted blob within the Windows
  registry that is typically found at HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\.wav\OpenWithProgIds. The encrypted data includes the AES key, IV, and path that is used to find and decrypt the file containing Snake's kernel driver and kernel driver loader.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Registry.registry_key_name)
  as registry_key_name values(Registry.registry_path) as registry_path min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path="*\\.wav\\OpenWithProgIds\\*"  by Registry.dest  Registry.user

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and will require tuning based on program Ids in large organizations.
