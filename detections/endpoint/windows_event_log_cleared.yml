description: The following analytic detects the clearing of Windows event logs by
  identifying Windows Security Event ID 1102 or System log event 104. This detection
  leverages Windows event logs to monitor for log clearing activities. Such behavior
  is significant as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
  If confirmed malicious, this action could hinder forensic investigations and allow
  attackers to persist undetected, making it crucial to investigate further and correlate
  with other alerts and data sources.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 1102
- Windows Event Log System 104
search: '(`wineventlog_security` EventCode=1102) OR (`wineventlog_system` EventCode=104)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest name EventCode
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_event_log_cleared_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows event logs from your hosts. In addition, the Splunk Windows TA is needed.
known_false_positives: It is possible that these logs may be legitimately cleared
  by Administrators. Filter as needed.
