description: The following analytic utilizes Windows Security Event ID 1102 or System
  log event 104 to identify when a Windows event log is cleared. Note that this analytic
  will require tuning or restricted to specific endpoints based on criticality. During
  triage, based on time of day and user, determine if this was planned. If not planned,
  follow through with reviewing parallel alerts and other data sources to determine
  what else may have occurred.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '(`wineventlog_security` EventCode=1102) OR (`wineventlog_system` EventCode=104)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest name EventCode
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_event_log_cleared_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows event logs from your hosts. In addition, the Splunk Windows TA is needed.
known_false_positives: It is possible that these logs may be legitimately cleared
  by Administrators. Filter as needed.
