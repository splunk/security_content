description: The following analytic detects a suspicious `rundll32.exe` process making HTTP connections and performing DNS queries to web domains. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 22 logs to identify these activities. This behavior is significant as it is commonly associated with IcedID malware, where `rundll32.exe` checks internet connectivity and communicates with C&C servers to download configurations and other components. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to establish persistence, download additional payloads, and exfiltrate sensitive data, posing a severe threat to the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 process_name="rundll32.exe" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(query) as query values(answer) as answer values(QueryResults) as query_results values(QueryStatus) as query_status by process_name process_guid Computer | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rundll32_dnsquery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name and eventcode = 22 dnsquery executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
