description: This search is to detect a suspicious rundll32.exe process having a http
  connection and do a dns query in some web domain. This technique was seen in IcedID
  malware where the rundll32 that execute its payload will contact amazon.com to check
  internet connect and to communicate to its C&C server to download config and other
  file component.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 process_name="rundll32.exe" | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(query) as query values(answer) as answer values(QueryResults) as query_results values(QueryStatus) as query_status by process_name process_guid Computer | rename Computer as dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rundll32_dnsquery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and eventcode = 22 dnsquery executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
