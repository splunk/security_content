description: The following analytic detects a suspicious `rundll32.exe` process making
  HTTP connections and performing DNS queries to web domains. It leverages Sysmon
  EventCode 22 logs to identify these activities. This behavior is significant as
  it is commonly associated with IcedID malware, where `rundll32.exe` checks internet
  connectivity and communicates with C&C servers to download configurations and other
  components. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to establish
  persistence, download additional payloads, and exfiltrate sensitive data, posing
  a severe threat to the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 process_name="rundll32.exe" | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(query) as query values(answer) as answer
  values(QueryResults) as query_results values(QueryStatus) as query_status by process_name
  process_guid Computer | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rundll32_dnsquery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and eventcode = 22 dnsquery executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
