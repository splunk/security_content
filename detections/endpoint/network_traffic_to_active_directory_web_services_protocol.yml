description: The following analytic identifies network traffic directed to the Active
  Directory Web Services Protocol (ADWS) on port 9389. It leverages network traffic
  logs, focusing on source and destination IP addresses, application names, and destination
  ports. This activity is significant as ADWS is used to manage Active Directory,
  and unauthorized access could indicate malicious intent. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could manipulate Active Directory, potentially leading to privilege
  escalation, unauthorized access, or persistent control over the environment.
search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.dest_port=9389
  by All_Traffic.src_ip, All_Traffic.dest_ip, All_Traffic.app, All_Traffic.user, All_Traffic.dest_port
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")`
  | `network_traffic_to_active_directory_web_services_protocol_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from network traffic
  logs. The logs must contain the source and destination IP addresses, the application
  name, and the destination port. The logs must be processed using the appropriate
  Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the network traffic data source.
  The logs must also be mapped to the `Network_Traffic` data model. Use the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data
  modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as the destination port is
  specific to Active Directory Web Services Protocol, however we recommend utilizing
  this analytic to hunt for non-standard processes querying the ADWS port. Filter
  by App or dest_ip to AD servers and remove known proceses querying ADWS.
