description: This analytic identifies when Microsoft HTML Application Host (mshta.exe)
  utility is used to make remote http connections. Adversaries may use mshta.exe to
  proxy the download and execution of remote .hta files. The analytic identifies command
  line arguments of http and https being used. This technique is commonly used by
  malicious software to bypass preventative controls. The search will return the first
  time and last time these command-line arguments were used for these executions,
  as well as the target system, the user, process "rundll32.exe" and its parent process.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_mshta` (Processes.process="*http://*"
  OR Processes.process="*https://*") by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.dest  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_mshta_url_in_command_line_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible legitimate applications may perform this behavior
  and will need to be filtered.
