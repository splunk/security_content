description: The following analytic detects a potential deletion of firewall rules, indicating a possible security breach or unauthorized access attempt. 
  It identifies actions where firewall rules are removed using commands like netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule, which can expose the network to external 
  threats by disabling critical security measures. Monitoring these activities helps maintain network integrity and prevent malicious attacks.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=12 TargetObject = "*\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\FirewallRules\\*" EventType=DeleteValue 
  |  rename Computer as dest
  |  rename User as user
  |  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode EventType TargetObject Image user dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_modify_registry_delete_firewall_rules_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the offical
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
known_false_positives: network admin may add/remove/modify public inbound firewall
  rule that may cause this rule to be triggered.
