description: This search is to detect a execution of jscript using cscript process.
  Commonly when a user run jscript file it was executed by wscript.exe application.
  This technique was seen in FIN7 js implant to execute its malicious script using
  cscript process. This behavior is uncommon and a good artifacts to check further
  anomalies within the network
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "cscript.exe" AND Processes.parent_process = "*//e:jscript*") OR (Processes.process_name
  = "cscript.exe" AND Processes.process = "*//e:jscript*") by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `jscript_execution_using_cscript_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
