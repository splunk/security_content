description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify commandlets used by the PowerView hacking tool leveraged to discover Windows endpoints with Kerberos Constrained Delegation.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may leverage use this technique for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (Message = "*Get-DomainComputer*" OR Message = "*Get-NetComputer*")
  AND (Message = "*-TrustedToAuth*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by EventCode Message ComputerName User | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_powerview_constrained_delegation_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following  analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may leverage PowerView for system management or troubleshooting.
