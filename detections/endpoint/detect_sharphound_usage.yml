description: The following analytic detects the usage of the SharpHound binary by
  identifying its original filename, `SharpHound.exe`, and the process name. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process metadata and command-line executions. SharpHound is a tool used for Active
  Directory enumeration, often by attackers during the reconnaissance phase. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to map out the network, identify
  high-value targets, and plan further attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation
  and lateral movement within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=sharphound.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=SharpHound.exe) by Processes.dest Processes.user

  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_sharphound_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is specific to a
  file attribute not used by anything else. Filter as needed.
