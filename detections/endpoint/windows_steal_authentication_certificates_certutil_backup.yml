description: The following analytic detects CertUtil.exe performing a backup of the Certificate Store. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line executions involving CertUtil with backup parameters. This activity is significant because it may indicate an attempt to steal authentication certificates, which are critical for secure communications. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use the stolen certificates to impersonate users, decrypt sensitive data, or gain unauthorized access to systems, leading to severe security breaches.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be generated based on normal certificate store backups. Leave enabled to generate Risk, as this is meant to be an anomaly analytic. If CS backups are not normal, enable as TTP.
