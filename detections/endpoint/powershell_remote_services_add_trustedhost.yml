description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious PowerShell script execution via EventCode 4104 
  that contains command to add or modify the trustedhost configuration in Windows OS. 
  This behavior raises concerns due to the nature of modifications made to the 'TrustedHost' configuration, 
  which typically involves adjusting settings crucial for remote connections and security protocols. 
  Alterations in this area could potentially indicate attempts to manipulate trusted hosts or systems 
  for unauthorized remote access, a tactic commonly observed in various unauthorized access or compromise attempts.

  | `powershell_remote_services_add_trustedhost_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: user and network administrator may used this function to add trusted host.
