description: This detection identifies Microsoft Exchange Server's Unified Messaging
  services, umworkerprocess.exe and umservice.exe, spawning a child process, indicating
  possible exploitation of CVE-2021-26857 vulnerability. The query filters out werfault.exe
  and wermgr.exe mostly due to potential false positives, however, if there is an
  excessive amount of "wermgr.exe" or "WerFault.exe" failures, it may be due to the
  active exploitation. During triage, identify any additional suspicious parallel
  processes. Identify any recent out of place file modifications. Review Exchange
  logs following Microsofts guide. To contain, perform egress filtering or restrict
  public access to Exchange. In final, patch the vulnerablity and monitor.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name="umworkerprocess.exe"
  OR Processes.parent_process_name="UMService.exe" (Processes.process_name!="wermgr.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name!="werfault.exe") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process

  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `unified_messaging_service_spawning_a_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Tune out child processes as needed to limit volume
  of false positives.
