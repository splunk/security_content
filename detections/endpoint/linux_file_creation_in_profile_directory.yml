type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic looks for suspicious file creation in /etc/profile.d directory
  to automatically execute scripts by shell upon boot up of a linux machine. This
  technique is commonly abused by adversaries, malware and red teamers as a persistence
  mechanism to the targeted or compromised host. This Anomaly detection is a good
  indicator that someone wants to run a code after boot up which can be done also
  by the administrator or network operator for automation purposes.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/profile.d/*")
  by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.process_guid
  Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_file_creation_in_profile_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create file in profile.d
  folders for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false
  positives.
