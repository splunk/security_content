name: Linux File Creation In Profile Directory

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the creation of files in the /etc/profile.d
  directory on Linux systems. It leverages filesystem data to identify new files in
  this directory, which is often used by adversaries for persistence by executing
  scripts upon system boot. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt
  to maintain long-term access to the compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges each time
  the system boots, potentially leading to further compromise and data exfiltration.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/profile.d/*")
  by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.process_guid
  Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_file_creation_in_profile_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create file in profile.d
  folders for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false
  positives.
