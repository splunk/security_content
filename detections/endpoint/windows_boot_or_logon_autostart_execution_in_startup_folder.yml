- Endpoint
description: This analytic will identify suspicious files dropped or created in the Windows %startup% folder. 
  This technique is a common way to gain persistence on a targeted host. Threat actor, adversaries and red teamer 
  abuse this folder path to automatically execute their malicious sample upon boot or restart of the infected host. 
  This TTP detection is a good indicator that a suspicious process wants to gain persistence on the targeted host. We suggest to 
  verify the process name by using the process guid field, the file created and also the user and the computer name for further investigation.
search: '|tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where Filesystem.file_path = "*\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\*" 
  by Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.process_id Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.user Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.dest
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_boot_or_logon_autostart_execution_in_startup_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow creation of script or exe in this path.
