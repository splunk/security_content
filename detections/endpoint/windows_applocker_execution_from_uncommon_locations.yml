description: The following analytic identifies the execution of applications or scripts
  from uncommon or suspicious file paths, potentially indicating malware or unauthorized
  activity. It leverages Windows AppLocker event logs and uses statistical analysis
  to detect anomalies. By calculating the average and standard deviation of execution
  counts per file path, it flags paths with execution counts significantly higher
  than expected. This behavior is significant as it can uncover malicious activities
  or policy violations. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to execute unauthorized code, leading to potential system compromise or data breaches.
search: '`applocker` | spath input=UserData_Xml | rename RuleAndFileData.* as *, Computer
  as dest, TargetUser AS user | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by dest, PolicyName, RuleId, user, TargetProcessId, FilePath, FullFilePath
  | eventstats avg(count) as avg, stdev(count) as stdev | eval upperBound=(avg+stdev*2),
  anomaly=if(count > upperBound, "Yes", "No") | where anomaly="Yes" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_applocker_execution_from_uncommon_locations_filter`'
how_to_implement: The analytic is designed to be run against Windows AppLocker event
  logs collected from endpoints with AppLocker enabled. If using Microsoft Defender
  for Endpoint (MDE), modify the analytic to use EventTypes/ActionTypes that match
  the block events for AppLocker. The analytic requires the AppLocker event logs to
  be ingested into Splunk. Note that, an additional method to reduce any false positives
  would be to add the specific EventCodes - 8003 or 8004 and filter from there. Upon
  tuning, modify to Anomaly or TTP.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate users are executing
  applications from file paths that are not permitted by AppLocker. It is recommended
  to investigate the context of the application execution to determine if it is malicious
  or not. Modify the threshold as needed to reduce false positives.
