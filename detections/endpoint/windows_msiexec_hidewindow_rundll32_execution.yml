description: The following analytic detects the execution of the msiexec.exe process
  with the /HideWindow and rundll32 command-line parameters. It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events
  and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because it is a known tactic
  used by malware like QakBot to mask malicious operations under legitimate system
  processes. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to download
  additional payloads, execute malicious code, or establish communication with remote
  servers, thereby evading detection and maintaining persistence.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Other possible 3rd party msi software installers use this technique
  as part of its installation process.
