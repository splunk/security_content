description: The following analytic identifies a msiexec.exe process with hidewindow rundll32 process commandline.  
  One such tactic involves utilizing system processes like "msiexec," "hidewindow," and "rundll32" through command-line execution. 
  By leveraging these legitimate processes, QakBot masks its malicious operations, hiding behind seemingly normal system activities. 
  This clandestine approach allows the trojan to carry out unauthorized tasks discreetly, such as downloading additional payloads, 
  executing malicious code, or establishing communication with remote servers. This obfuscation through trusted system processes 
  enables QakBot to operate stealthily, evading detection by security mechanisms and perpetuating its harmful actions without raising suspicion.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Other possible 3rd party msi software installers use this technique as part of its installation process.
