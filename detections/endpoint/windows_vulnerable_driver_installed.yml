description: The following analytic detects the loading of known vulnerable Windows
  drivers, which may indicate potential persistence or privilege escalation attempts.
  It leverages Windows System service install EventCode 7045 to identify driver loading 
  events and cross-references them with a list of vulnerable drivers. This activity is 
  significant as attackers often exploit vulnerable drivers to gain elevated privileges 
  or maintain persistence on a system. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers 
  to execute arbitrary code with high privileges, leading to further system compromise 
  and potential data exfiltration. This detection is a Windows Event Log adaptation of 
  the Sysmon driver loaded detection written by Michael Haag.
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ServiceType="kernel mode driver" | table _time dest EventCode ImagePath ServiceName ServiceType | lookup loldrivers driver_name AS ImagePath OUTPUT is_driver driver_description | search is_driver = TRUE  | `windows_vulnerable_driver_installed_filter`'
how_to_implement: Ensure the Splunk is collecting XmlWinEventLog:System events and the EventCode 7045 is being ingested. 
known_false_positives: False positives will be present. Drill down into the driver
  further by version number and cross reference by signer. Review the reference material
  in the lookup. In addition, modify the query to look within specific paths, which
  will remove a lot of "normal" drivers.
