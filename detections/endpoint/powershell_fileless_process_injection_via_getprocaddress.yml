description: 'The following analytic detects the use of `GetProcAddress` in PowerShell
  script blocks, leveraging PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This
  method captures the full command sent to PowerShell, which is then logged in Windows
  event logs. The presence of `GetProcAddress` is unusual for typical PowerShell scripts
  and often indicates malicious activity, as many attack toolkits use it to achieve
  code execution. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to
  execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise. Analysts should
  review parallel processes and the entire logged script block for further investigation.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
