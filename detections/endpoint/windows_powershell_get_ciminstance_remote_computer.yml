- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: This analytic identifies the use of Get-CimInstance cmdlet with the -ComputerName parameter, which indicates that the cmdlet is being used to retrieve information from a remote computer. This can be useful for detecting instances of remote access, such as when an attacker uses PowerShell to connect to a remote system and gather information. By monitoring for this cmdlet with the -ComputerName parameter, security analysts can identify potential malicious activity on remote systems and take appropriate action to mitigate any threats.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: This is meant to be a low risk RBA anomaly analytic or to be used for hunting. Enable this with a low risk score and let it generate risk in the risk index.
