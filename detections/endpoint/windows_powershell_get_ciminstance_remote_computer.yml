description: The following analytic detects the use of the Get-CimInstance cmdlet
  with the -ComputerName parameter, indicating an attempt to retrieve information
  from a remote computer. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging to identify
  this specific command execution. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  unauthorized remote access or information gathering by an attacker. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow the attacker to collect sensitive data from remote systems,
  potentially leading to further exploitation or lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: This is meant to be a low risk RBA anomaly analytic or to be
  used for hunting. Enable this with a low risk score and let it generate risk in
  the risk index.
