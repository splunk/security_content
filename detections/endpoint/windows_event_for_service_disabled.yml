description: The following analytic detects when a Windows service is modified from
  a start type to disabled. It leverages system event logs, specifically EventCode
  7040, to identify this change. This activity is significant because adversaries
  often disable security or other critical services to evade detection and maintain
  control over a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow
  attackers to bypass security defenses, leading to further exploitation and persistence
  within the environment.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log System 7040
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7040  EventData_Xml="*disabled*" | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode Name UserID
  service ServiceName | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_event_for_service_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Windows service update may cause this event. In that scenario,
  filtering is needed.
