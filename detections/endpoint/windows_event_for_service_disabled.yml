description: This analytic will identify suspicious system event of services that
  was modified from start to disabled. This technique is seen where the adversary
  attempts to disable security app services, other malware services to evade the defense
  systems on the compromised host
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7040  EventData_Xml="*disabled*" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by Computer EventCode Name UserID service ServiceName | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_event_for_service_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Windows service update may cause this event. In that scenario,
  filtering is needed.
