description: The following analytic detects the execution of the Windows OS tool cmdkey.exe with the /delete parameter. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments. The activity is significant because cmdkey.exe can be used by attackers to delete stored credentials, potentially leading to privilege escalation and persistence. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to remove stored user credentials, hindering incident response efforts and enabling further unauthorized access to the compromised system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.
