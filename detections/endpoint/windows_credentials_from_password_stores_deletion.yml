description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS cmdkey.exe
  tool. This tool is being abused or used by several post exploitation tool and malware such as
  Darkgate malware to delete stored user names, passwords
  or credentials in the targeted Windows OS host. This information can be used by
  the attacker to gain privilege escalation and persistence in the targeted hosts
  for further attacks.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.
