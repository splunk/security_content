description: This analytic identifies XMRIG coinminer driver installation on the system.
  The XMRIG driver name by default is `WinRing0x64.sys`. This cpu miner is an open
  source project that is commonly abused by adversaries to infect and mine bitcoin.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=6 Signature="Noriyuki MIYAZAKI" OR ImageLoaded= "*\\WinRing0x64.sys"
  |  stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by  Computer ImageLoaded
  Hashes IMPHASH Signature Signed | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `xmrig_driver_loaded_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the driver loaded and Signature from your endpoints. If you are using
  Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited.
