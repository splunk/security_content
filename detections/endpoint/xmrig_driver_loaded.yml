description: The following analytic detects the installation of the XMRIG coinminer
  driver on a system. It identifies the loading of the `WinRing0x64.sys` driver, commonly
  associated with XMRIG, by analyzing Sysmon EventCode 6 logs for specific signatures
  and image loads. This activity is significant because XMRIG is an open-source CPU
  miner frequently exploited by adversaries to mine cryptocurrency illicitly. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized resource consumption, degraded
  system performance, and potential financial loss due to unauthorized cryptocurrency
  mining.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 6
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=6 Signature="Noriyuki MIYAZAKI" OR ImageLoaded= "*\\WinRing0x64.sys"
  |  stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by  dest ImageLoaded
  Hashes IMPHASH Signature Signed | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `xmrig_driver_loaded_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the driver loaded and Signature from your endpoints. If you are using
  Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited.
