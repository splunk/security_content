description: The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe without
  any command line arguments. This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process execution logs. It is significant
  because rundll32.exe typically requires command line arguments to function properly,
  and its absence is often associated with malicious activities, such as those performed
  by Cobalt Strike. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an attempt
  to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to credential dumping, unauthorized
  file writes, or other malicious actions.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_rundll32` by _time span=1h  Processes.process_id Processes.process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of rundll32, triggering a false positive.
