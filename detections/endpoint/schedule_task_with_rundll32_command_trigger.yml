description: The following analytic detects the creation of scheduled tasks in Windows
  that use the rundll32 command. It leverages Windows Security EventCode 4698, which
  logs the creation of scheduled tasks, and filters for tasks executed via rundll32.
  This activity is significant as it is a common technique used by malware, such as
  TrickBot, to persist in an environment or deliver additional payloads. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to data theft, ransomware deployment, or other damaging
  outcomes. Immediate investigation and mitigation are crucial to prevent further
  compromise.

search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698 | xmlkv Message | search Command IN
  ("*rundll32*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest,
  Task_Name, Command, Author, Enabled, Hidden, Arguments | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `schedule_task_with_rundll32_command_trigger_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the task schedule (Exa. Security Log EventCode 4698) endpoints. Tune and
  filter known instances of Task schedule used in your environment.
