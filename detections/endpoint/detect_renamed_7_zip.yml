description: The following analytic detects the usage of a renamed 7-Zip executable
  using Sysmon data. It leverages the OriginalFileName field to identify instances
  where the 7-Zip process has been renamed. This activity is significant as attackers
  often rename legitimate tools to evade detection while staging or exfiltrating data.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate data exfiltration attempts
  or other unauthorized data manipulation, potentially leading to significant data
  breaches or loss of sensitive information. Analysts should validate the legitimacy
  of the 7-Zip executable and investigate parallel processes for further suspicious
  activities.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.original_file_name=7z*.exe
  AND Processes.process_name!=7z*.exe) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.original_file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_renamed_7_zip_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives, however this analytic will need to
  be modified for each environment if Sysmon is not used.
