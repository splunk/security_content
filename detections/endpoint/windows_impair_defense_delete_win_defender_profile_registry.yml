type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The search looks for the deletion of Windows Defender main profile within
  the registry. This was used by RAT malware across a fleet of endpoints. This particular
  behavior is typically executed when an adversary gains access to an endpoint and
  beings to perform execution. Usually, a batch (.bat) will be executed and multiple
  registry and scheduled task modifications will occur. During triage, review parallel
  processes and identify any further file modifications.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path = "*\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows
  Defender" Registry.action = deleted by  Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name
  Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid Registry.action  Registry.user
  Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_delete_win_defender_profile_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
