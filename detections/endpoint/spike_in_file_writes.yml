description: The following analytic detects a sharp increase in the number of files
  written to a specific host. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem data model, focusing
  on 'created' actions and comparing current file write counts against historical
  averages and standard deviations. This activity is significant as a sudden spike
  in file writes can indicate malicious activities such as ransomware encryption or
  data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to significant
  data loss, system compromise, or further propagation of malware within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where Filesystem.action=created by _time span=1h, Filesystem.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | eventstats max(_time) as maxtime | stats count as num_data_samples max(eval(if(_time
  >= relative_time(maxtime, "-1d@d"), count, null))) as "count" avg(eval(if(_time<relative_time(maxtime,
  "-1d@d"), count,null))) as avg stdev(eval(if(_time<relative_time(maxtime, "-1d@d"),
  count, null))) as stdev by "dest" | eval upperBound=(avg+stdev*4), isOutlier=if((count
  > upperBound) AND num_data_samples >=20, 1, 0) | search isOutlier=1 | `spike_in_file_writes_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to implement this search, you must populate the Endpoint
  file-system data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection
  and response product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads
  and writes to the file system.
known_false_positives: It is important to understand that if you happen to install
  any new applications on your hosts or are copying a large number of files, you can
  expect to see a large increase of file modifications.
