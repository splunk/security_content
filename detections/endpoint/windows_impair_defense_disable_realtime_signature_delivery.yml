description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that disable the Windows Defender real-time signature delivery feature. It leverages
  data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, specifically monitoring changes to the
  registry path associated with Windows Defender signature updates. This activity
  is significant because disabling real-time signature delivery can prevent Windows
  Defender from receiving timely malware definitions, reducing its effectiveness.
  If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to bypass malware detection,
  leading to potential system compromise and persistent threats.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\Signature Updates\\RealtimeSignatureDelivery" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000000"
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_disable_realtime_signature_delivery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
