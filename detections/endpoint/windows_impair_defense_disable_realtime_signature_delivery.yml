description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to disable windows defender 
  realtime signature delivery feature. This setting governs how Windows Defender Antivirus receives updated signature 
  definitions for identifying and combating malware threats in real-time. The actual impact and behaviors associated 
  with different values for RealtimeSignatureDelivery can vary based on specific Windows Defender configurations and policies.
  For instance, setting this value to 0 or 1 might control whether real-time signatures are delivered via different methods 
  such as through Windows Update or directly from Microsoft's cloud-based services.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows Defender\\Signature Updates\\RealtimeSignatureDelivery"
  Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000000"

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_impair_defense_disable_realtime_signature_delivery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
