description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to disable
  security audit logs. This technique was shared by a researcher to disable Security
  logs of windows by adding this registry. The Windows will think it is WinPE and
  will not log any event to the Security Log
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path="*\\Control\\MiniNt\\*"
  by Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_key_name
  Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `disable_security_logs_using_minint_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
