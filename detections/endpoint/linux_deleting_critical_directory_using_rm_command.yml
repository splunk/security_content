description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious deletion of a critical
  folder in Linux machine using rm command. This technique was seen in industroyer2
  campaign to wipe or destroy energy facilities of a targeted sector. Deletion in
  these list of folder is not so common since it need some elevated privileges to
  access some of it. We recommend to look further events specially in file access
  or file deletion, process commandline that may related to this technique.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name =rm AND
  Processes.process= "* -rf *" AND Processes.process IN ("*/boot/*", "*/var/log/*",
  "*/etc/*", "*/dev/*") by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.dest

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_deleting_critical_directory_using_rm_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
