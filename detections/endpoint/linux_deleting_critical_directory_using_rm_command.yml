description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious deletion of a critical folder in Linux machine using rm command. 
  This technique was seen in industroyer2 campaign to wipe or destroy energy facilities of a targeted sector. Deletion in these list of folder 
  is not so common since it need some elevated privileges to access some of it. We recommend to look further events specially in file access or file deletion, 
  process commandline that may related to this technique.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name =rm AND Processes.process= "* -rf *" AND Processes.process IN ("*/boot/*", "*/var/log/*", "*/etc/*", "*/dev/*")
  by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `linux_deleting_critical_directory_using_rm_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
