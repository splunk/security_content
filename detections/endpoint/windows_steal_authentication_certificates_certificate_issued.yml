type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies when a new certificate is issued against
  the Certificate Services - AD CS. By its very nature this is not malicious, but
  should be tracked and correlated with other events related to certificates being
  issued. When the CA issues the certificate, it creates EID 4887 'Certificate Services
  approved a certificate request and issued a certificate". The event supplies the
  requester user context, the DNS hostname of the machine they requested the certificate
  from, and the time they requested the certificate. The attributes fields in these
  event commonly has values for CDC, RMD, and CCM which correspond to Client DC, Request
  Machine DNS name, and Cert Client Machine, respectively.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4887
search: '`wineventlog_security`  EventCode=4887 | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest, name, Requester, action, Attributes, Subject | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `windows_steal_authentication_certificates_certificate_issued_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, enhanced Audit Logging must be enabled
  on AD CS and within Group Policy Management for CS server. See Page 115 of first
  reference.
known_false_positives: False positives will be generated based on normal certificates
  issued. Leave enabled to generate Risk, as this is meant to be an anomaly analytic.
