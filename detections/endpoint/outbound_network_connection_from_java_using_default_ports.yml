name: Outbound Network Connection from Java Using Default Ports

status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects outbound network connections from Java
  processes to default ports used by LDAP and RMI protocols, which may indicate exploitation
  of the CVE-2021-44228-Log4j vulnerability. This detection leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and network traffic logs.
  Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can signify an attackerâ€™s attempt to perform
  JNDI lookups and retrieve malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could lead to remote code execution and further compromise of the affected server.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate Java applications may use perform outbound connections
  to these ports. Filter as needed
