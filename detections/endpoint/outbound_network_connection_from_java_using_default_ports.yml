description: A required step while exploiting the CVE-2021-44228-Log4j vulnerability is that the victim server will perform
 outbound connections to attacker-controlled infrastrucutre. This is required as part of the JNDI lookup as well as 
 for retrieving the second stage .class payload. The following analytic identifies the Java process reaching out to default ports used by
 the LDAP and RMI protocols. This behavior could represent successfull exploitation.
search: ' `sysmon` EventCode=3  (process_name=java OR process_name=java.exe) 
 (DestinationPort=389 OR DestinationPort=1389 OR DestinationPort = 1099 ) | rename Computer as dest
 |  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, process_name, DestinationPort 
 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
 | `outbound_network_connection_from_java_using_default_ports_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Legitimate Java applications may use perform outbound connections to these ports. Filter as needed
