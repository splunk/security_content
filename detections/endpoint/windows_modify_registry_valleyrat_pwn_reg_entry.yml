description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows Registry specifically targeting `.pwn` file associations related to the ValleyRAT malware. ValleyRAT may create or alter registry entries to associate `.pwn` files with malicious processes, allowing it to execute harmful scripts or commands when these files are opened. By monitoring for unusual changes in registry keys linked to `.pwn` extensions, this detection enables security analysts to identify potential ValleyRAT infection attempts. Early detection of these modifications helps mitigate unauthorized execution and prevents further exploitation of the system.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry WHERE (Registry.registry_path= "*.pwn\\Shell\\Open\\command" OR Registry.registry_value_data = ".pwn") BY Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_valleyrat_pwn_reg_entry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the offical Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
