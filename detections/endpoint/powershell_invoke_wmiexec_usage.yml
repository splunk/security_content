description: The following analytic detects the execution of the Invoke-WMIExec utility
  within PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104). This detection leverages
  PowerShell script block logs to identify instances where the Invoke-WMIExec command
  is used. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it indicates potential lateral movement
  using WMI commands with NTLMv2 pass-the-hash authentication. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow an attacker to execute commands remotely on target systems,
  potentially leading to further compromise and lateral spread within the network.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN ("*invoke-wmiexec*") | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode ScriptBlockText
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `powershell_invoke_wmiexec_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this analytic is designed
  to detect a specific utility. It is recommended to apply appropriate filters as
  needed to minimize the number of false positives.
