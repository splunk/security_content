- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the Invoke-WMIExec utility within PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104). This detection leverages PowerShell script block logs to identify instances where the Invoke-WMIExec command is used. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it indicates potential lateral movement using WMI commands with NTLMv2 pass-the-hash authentication. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to execute commands remotely on target systems, potentially leading to further compromise and lateral spread within the network.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this analytic is designed to detect a specific utility. It is recommended to apply appropriate filters as needed to minimize the number of false positives.
