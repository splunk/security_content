type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies Schtasks.exe creating a new task with
  highest privilege execution. This techniques was seen in asyncrat where it uses
  the scheduled task as part of it persistence and privilege escalation. AsyncRAT
  will setup a scheduled task with parameter '/rl' and 'highest' to trigger this technique.
  This TTP detection can be a good indicator of malware or adversaries trying to gain
  persistence and privilege escalation through scheduled task. We recommend to always
  check and monitoring this type of events even filtering is needed.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "schtasks.exe"
  Processes.process = "*/rl *" Processes.process = "* highest *" by Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process Processes.process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_scheduled_task_with_highest_privileges_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to legitimate applications
  creating a task to run as SYSTEM. Filter as needed based on parent process, or modify
  the query to have world writeable paths to restrict it.
