description: 'The following analytic identifies an unusual number of remote authentication
  attempts from a single source by leveraging Windows Event ID 4624, which logs successful
  account logons. It uses statistical analysis, specifically the 3-sigma rule, to
  detect deviations from normal behavior. This activity is significant for a SOC as
  it may indicate lateral movement, malware staging, or reconnaissance. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to move laterally within the network,
  escalate privileges, or gather information for further attacks.'

- Windows Event Log Security 4624

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: An single endpoint authenticating to a large number of hosts
  is not common behavior. Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited
  to vulnerability scanners, jump servers and missconfigured systems.
