description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to disable
  logoff feature in windows host. This registry when enable will prevent users to
  log off of the system by using any method, including programs run from the command
  line, such as scripts. It also disables or removes all menu items and buttons that
  log the user off of the system. This technique was seen abused by ransomware malware
  to make the compromised host un-useful and hard to remove other registry modification
  made on the machine that needs restart to take effect. This windows feature may
  implement by administrator in some server where shutdown is critical. In that scenario
  filter of machine and users that can modify this registry is needed.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the offical
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
known_false_positives: This windows feature may implement by administrator in some
  server where shutdown is critical. In that scenario filter of machine and users
  that can modify this registry is needed.
