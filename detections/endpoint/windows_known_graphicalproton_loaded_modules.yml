description: The following analytic identifies a potential suspicious process loading dll modules related to Graphicalproton backdoor implant of SVR.
  These DLL modules have been observed in SVR attacks, commonly used to install backdoors on targeted hosts. 
  This anomaly detection highlights the need for thorough investigation and immediate mitigation measures to safeguard the network against potential breaches.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
