description: The following analytic detects the loading of DLL modules associated
  with the GraphicalProton backdoor implant, commonly used by SVR in targeted attacks.
  It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify specific DLLs loaded by processes. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate the presence of a sophisticated backdoor,
  warranting immediate investigation. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could gain
  persistent access to the compromised host, potentially leading to further exploitation
  and data exfiltration.

  "*\\UnregisterAncestorAppendAuto.dll", "*\\DeregisterSeekUsers.dll", "*\\ScrollbarHandleGet.dll",

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
