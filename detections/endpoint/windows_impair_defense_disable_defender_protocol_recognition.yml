description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that disable the Windows Defender protocol recognition feature. It leverages data
  from the Endpoint.Registry data model, specifically looking for changes to the "DisableProtocolRecognition"
  setting. This activity is significant because disabling protocol recognition can
  hinder Windows Defender's ability to detect and respond to malware or suspicious
  software. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow an attacker to bypass
  antivirus defenses, facilitating further malicious activities such as data exfiltration
  or system compromise.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\NIS\\DisableProtocolRecognition" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001"
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_disable_defender_protocol_recognition_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
