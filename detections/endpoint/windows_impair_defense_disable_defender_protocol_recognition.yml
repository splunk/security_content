description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry that disable the Windows Defender protocol recognition feature. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, specifically looking for changes to the "DisableProtocolRecognition" setting. This activity is significant because disabling protocol recognition can hinder Windows Defender's ability to detect and respond to malware or suspicious software. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow an attacker to bypass antivirus defenses, facilitating further malicious activities such as data exfiltration or system compromise.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows Defender\\NIS\\DisableProtocolRecognition" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001" by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_disable_defender_protocol_recognition_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro to tune the search.
