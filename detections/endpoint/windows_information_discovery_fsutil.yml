description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS built-in tool FSUTIL to discover file system information. 
  This tool is being abused or used by several adversaries or threat actor to query/list all drives, drive type, 
  volume information or volume statistics by using the FSINFO parameter of this tool. This technique was seen in 
  WINPEAS post exploitation tool that is being used by ransomware prestige to gain privilege and persistence to the targeted host.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name="fsutil.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name = "fsutil.exe" AND Processes.process = "*fsinfo*"
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid 
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_information_discovery_fsutil_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
