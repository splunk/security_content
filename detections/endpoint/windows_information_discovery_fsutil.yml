description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the Windows built-in
  tool FSUTIL with the FSINFO parameter to discover file system information. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process execution logs that include command-line details. Monitoring this activity
  is significant because FSUTIL can be abused by adversaries to gather detailed information
  about the file system, aiding in further exploitation. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could enable attackers to map the file system, identify valuable data,
  and plan subsequent actions such as privilege escalation or persistence.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="fsutil.exe"
  OR Processes.original_file_name = "fsutil.exe" AND Processes.process = "*fsinfo*"
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_information_discovery_fsutil_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
