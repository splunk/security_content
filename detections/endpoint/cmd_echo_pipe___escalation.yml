description: The following analytic identifies the use of named-pipe impersonation
  for privilege escalation, commonly associated with Cobalt Strike and similar frameworks.
  It detects command-line executions where `cmd.exe` uses `echo` to write to a named
  pipe, such as `cmd.exe /c echo 4sgryt3436 > \\.\Pipe\5erg53`. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and
  command-line telemetry. This activity is significant as it indicates potential privilege
  escalation attempts. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain elevated privileges,
  enabling further compromise and persistence within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_cmd` OR Processes.process=*%comspec%*
  (Processes.process=*echo* AND Processes.process=*pipe*) by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `cmd_echo_pipe___escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Unknown. It is possible filtering may be required to ensure
  fidelity.
