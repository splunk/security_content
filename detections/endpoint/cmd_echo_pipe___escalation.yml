description: This analytic identifies a common behavior by Cobalt Strike and other
  frameworks where the adversary will escalate privileges, either via `jump` (Cobalt
  Strike PTH) or `getsystem`, using named-pipe impersonation. A suspicious event will
  look like `cmd.exe /c echo 4sgryt3436 > \\.\Pipe\5erg53`.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_cmd` OR Processes.process=*%comspec%*
  (Processes.process=*echo* AND Processes.process=*pipe*) by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Unknown. It is possible filtering may be required to ensure
  fidelity.

    on endpoint $dest$ by user $user$ potentially performing privilege escalation
    using named pipes related to Cobalt Strike and other frameworks.
