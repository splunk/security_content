description: The following analytic detects the execution of the c99 utility with
  sudo privileges, which can lead to privilege escalation on Linux systems. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution
  logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant because it
  indicates a potential misuse of the c99 utility to gain root access, which is critical
  for maintaining system security. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to execute commands as root, potentially compromising the entire system and accessing
  sensitive information.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*c99*" AND
  Processes.process="*-wrapper*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_c99_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
