description: This search is to detect suspicious process injection in command shell.
  This technique was seen in IcedID where it execute cmd.exe process to inject its
  shellcode as part of its execution as banking trojan. It is really uncommon to have
  a create remote thread execution in the following application.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 TargetImage IN ("*\\cmd.exe", "*\\powershell*") | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by  TargetImage TargetProcessId
  SourceProcessId  EventCode StartAddress SourceImage dest |rename SourceImage as process_name| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `create_remote_thread_in_shell_application_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
