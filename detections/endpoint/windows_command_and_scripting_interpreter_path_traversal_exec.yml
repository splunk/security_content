date: '2022-06-01'
author: Teoderick Contreras, Splunk
status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies path traversal command-line execution.
  This technique was seen in malicious document that execute malicious code using
  msdt.exe and path traversal technique that serve as defense evasion. This TTP is
  a good pivot to look for more suspicious process and command-line that runs before
  and after this execution. This may help you to find possible downloaded malware
  or other lolbin execution.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process="*\/..\/..\/..\/*"
  OR Processes.process="*\\..\\..\\..\\*" OR Processes.process="*\/\/..\/\/..\/\/..\/\/*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_hash | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_command_and_scripting_interpreter_path_traversal_exec_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product
known_false_positives: Not known at this moment.
