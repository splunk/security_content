status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies path traversal command-line execution.
  This technique was seen in malicious document that execute malicious code using
  msdt.exe and path traversal technique that serve as defense evasion. This TTP is
  a good pivot to look for more suspicious process and command-line that runs before
  and after this execution. This may help you to find possible downloaded malware
  or other lolbin execution.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
