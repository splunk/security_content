type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic detects a powershell script that enumerate camera mounted to the targeted host. 
  This technique was seen in DCRat malware, where it runs a powershell command to look for camera information that will be pass on to its
  C2 server. This anomaly detection can be a good pivot to check who and why this enumeration is needed and what parent process execute this powershell
  script command.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators may execute this powershell command to get hardware information related to camera.
