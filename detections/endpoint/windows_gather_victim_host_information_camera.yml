type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects a PowerShell script that enumerates camera
  devices on the targeted host. This detection leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging,
  specifically looking for commands querying Win32_PnPEntity for camera-related information.
  This activity is significant as it is commonly observed in DCRat malware, which
  collects camera data to send to its command-and-control server. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could indicate an attempt to gather sensitive visual information from
  the host, potentially leading to privacy breaches or further exploitation.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText= "* Win32_PnPEntity *" ScriptBlockText=
  "*SELECT*" ScriptBlockText= "*WHERE*" ScriptBlockText = "*PNPClass*" ScriptBlockText
  IN ("*Image*", "*Camera*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename
  UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_gather_victim_host_information_camera_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators may execute this powershell command to get hardware
  information related to camera on $dest$.
