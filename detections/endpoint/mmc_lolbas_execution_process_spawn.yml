description: The following analytic identifies `mmc.exe` spawning a LOLBAS execution
  process. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process creation events where `mmc.exe` is the parent process. This activity
  is significant because adversaries can abuse the DCOM protocol and MMC20 COM object
  to execute malicious code, using Windows native binaries documented by the LOLBAS
  project. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate lateral movement,
  allowing attackers to execute code remotely, potentially leading to further compromise
  and persistence within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may trigger this behavior, filter as
  needed.
