description: The following analytic detects a process modifying the registry with
  a known malicious CLSID under InProcServer32. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on registry modifications within the HKLM or
  HKCU Software Classes CLSID paths. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  an attempt to load a malicious DLL, potentially leading to code execution. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow an attacker to persist in the environment, execute arbitrary
  code, or escalate privileges, posing a severe threat to system integrity and security.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, filter as needed. In our
  test case, Remcos used regsvr32.exe to modify the registry. It may be required,
  dependent upon the EDR tool producing registry events, to remove (Default) from
  the command-line.
