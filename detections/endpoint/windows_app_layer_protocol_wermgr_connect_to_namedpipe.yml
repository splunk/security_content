type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious wermgr.exe process creating
  or connecting to a named pipe. Wermgr.exe is part of Windows OS Problem reporting
  application responsible for reporting problems, fault or error happen on the Windows
  OS. This file is being abused by several Threat actors and malware such as Trickbot
  and Qakbot to execute their malicious code. This anomaly detection can be a good
  pivot on possible wermgr.exe processes having injected malicious code that might
  be related to qakbot infection that communicates via named pipe.
data_source: []
search: '`sysmon` EventCode IN (17, 18) Image= "*\\wermgr.exe" EventType IN ( "CreatePipe",
  "ConnectPipe") | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by
  Image EventType ProcessGuid ProcessId PipeName SecurityID EventCode Computer UserID
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_app_layer_protocol_wermgr_connect_to_namedpipe_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, pipename, processguid and named pipe event type from
  your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of
  the Sysmon TA.
