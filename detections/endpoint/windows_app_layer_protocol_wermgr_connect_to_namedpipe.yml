type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the wermgr.exe process creating or connecting
  to a named pipe. It leverages Sysmon EventCodes 17 and 18 to identify these actions.
  This activity is significant because wermgr.exe, a legitimate Windows OS Problem
  Reporting application, is often abused by malware such as Trickbot and Qakbot to
  execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate that
  an attacker has injected code into wermgr.exe, potentially allowing them to communicate
  covertly, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 17
- Sysmon EventID 18
search: '`sysmon` EventCode IN (17, 18) Image= "*\\wermgr.exe" EventType IN ( "CreatePipe",
  "ConnectPipe") | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by
  Image EventType ProcessGuid ProcessId PipeName SecurityID EventCode dest UserID
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_app_layer_protocol_wermgr_connect_to_namedpipe_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, pipename, processguid and named pipe event type from
  your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of
  the Sysmon TA.
