datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic looks for commands to create user accounts on the linux
  platform. This technique is commonly abuse by adversaries, malware author and red
  teamers to persist on the targeted or compromised host by creating new user with
  an elevated privilege. This Hunting query may catch normal creation of user by administrator
  so filter is needed.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name IN ("useradd", "adduser") OR Processes.process IN ("*useradd
  *", "*adduser *") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_add_user_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
