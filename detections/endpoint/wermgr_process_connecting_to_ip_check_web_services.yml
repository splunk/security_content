description: This search is designed to detect suspicious wermgr.exe process that
  tries to connect to known IP web services. This technique is know for trickbot and
  other trojan spy malware to recon the infected machine and look for its ip address
  without so much finger print on the commandline process. Since wermgr.exe is designed
  for error handling process of windows it is really suspicious that this process
  is trying to connect to this IP web services cause that maybe cause of some malicious
  code injection.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode =22 process_name = wermgr.exe QueryName IN ("*wtfismyip.com",
  "*checkip.amazonaws.com", "*ipecho.net", "*ipinfo.io", "*api.ipify.org", "*icanhazip.com",
  "*ip.anysrc.com","*api.ip.sb", "ident.me", "www.myexternalip.com", "*zen.spamhaus.org",
  "*cbl.abuseat.org", "*b.barracudacentral.org","*dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net", "*spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net")

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wermgr_process_connecting_to_ip_check_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, dns query name process path , and query ststus from
  your endpoints like EventCode 22. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 12 of the Sysmon TA.
