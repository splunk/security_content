description: The following analytic detects the wermgr.exe process attempting to connect
  to known IP check web services. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 22 to identify DNS
  queries made by wermgr.exe to specific IP check services. This activity is significant
  because wermgr.exe is typically used for Windows error reporting, and its connection
  to these services may indicate malicious code injection, often associated with malware
  like Trickbot. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to recon
  the infected machine's IP address, aiding in further exploitation and evasion tactics.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode =22 process_name = wermgr.exe QueryName IN ("*wtfismyip.com",
  "*checkip.amazonaws.com", "*ipecho.net", "*ipinfo.io", "*api.ipify.org", "*icanhazip.com",
  "*ip.anysrc.com","*api.ip.sb", "ident.me", "www.myexternalip.com", "*zen.spamhaus.org",
  "*cbl.abuseat.org", "*b.barracudacentral.org","*dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net", "*spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net")
  |  stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Image process_name
  ProcessId QueryName QueryStatus QueryResults EventCode Computer | rename Computer
  as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `wermgr_process_connecting_to_ip_check_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, dns query name process path , and query ststus from
  your endpoints like EventCode 22. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 12 of the Sysmon TA.
