description: The following analytic identifies the use of `reg.exe` exporting Windows
  Registry hives containing credentials. Adversaries may use this technique to export
  registry hives for offline credential access attacks. Typically found executed from
  a untrusted process or script. Upon execution, a file will be written to disk.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=reg.exe
  (Processes.process=*save* OR Processes.process=*export*) AND (Processes.process=*sam*
  OR Processes.process=*system* OR Processes.process=*security*) by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `extract_sam_from_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: It is possible some agent based products will generate false
  positives. Filter as needed.
