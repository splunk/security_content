description: This search is to detect a suspicious rundll32 commandline to lock the
  workstation through command line. This technique was seen in CONTI leak tooling
  and script as part of its defense evasion. This technique is not a common practice
  to lock a screen and maybe a good indicator of compromise.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=rundll32.exe
  Processes.process= "*user32.dll,LockWorkStation*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rundll32_lockworkstation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
