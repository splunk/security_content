description: The following analytic detects the creation of the doas.conf file on
  a Linux host. This file is used by the doas utility to allow standard users to perform
  tasks as root, similar to sudo. The detection leverages filesystem data from the
  Endpoint data model, focusing on the creation of the doas.conf file. This activity
  is significant because it can indicate an attempt to gain elevated privileges, potentially
  by an adversary. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute
  commands with root privileges, leading to full system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/doas.conf")
  by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.process_guid
  Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_doas_conf_file_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
