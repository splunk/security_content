type: Anomaly
status: production
data_source:
- Windows System 7045
description: The following analytic detects the creation of the RemComSvc service
  on a Windows endpoint, typically indicating lateral movement using RemCom.exe. It
  leverages Windows EventCode 7045 from the System event log, specifically looking
  for the "RemCom Service" name. This activity is significant as it often signifies
  unauthorized lateral movement within the network, which is a common tactic used
  by attackers to spread malware or gain further access. If confirmed malicious, this
  could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems, data exfiltration, or further
  compromise of the network.
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ServiceName="RemCom Service" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest ImagePath ServiceName
  ServiceType   | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_service_create_remcomsvc_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, the Windows EventCode 7045 will need
  to be logged. The Windows TA for Splunk is also recommended.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed based on administrative
  activity.
