- Windows Event Log System 7045
description: The following analytic detects the creation of the RemComSvc service on a Windows endpoint, typically indicating lateral movement using RemCom.exe. It leverages Windows EventCode 7045 from the System event log, specifically looking for the "RemCom Service" name. This activity is significant as it often signifies unauthorized lateral movement within the network, which is a common tactic used by attackers to spread malware or gain further access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the network.
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ServiceName="RemCom Service" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest ImagePath ServiceName ServiceType   | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_create_remcomsvc_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, the Windows EventCode 7045 will need to be logged. The Windows TA for Splunk is also recommended.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed based on administrative activity.
