description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to disable Windows Defender 
  PUA protection.
  Setting PUAProtection to 0 typically disables the detection and protection against Potentially Unwanted Applications 
  by Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Potentially Unwanted Applications include software that may not be inherently 
  malicious but could exhibit behaviors that users may find undesirable, such as adware, browser toolbars, or software bundlers.
  Disabling this feature might be preferred in certain situations, but it's essential to consider potential security implications. 
  Enabling PUA protection provides an additional layer of defense against software that might negatively impact user experience 
  or security.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows Defender\\PUAProtection"

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
