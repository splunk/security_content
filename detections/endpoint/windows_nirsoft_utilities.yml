datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following hunting analytic assists with identifying the proces execution
  of commonly used utilities from NirSoft. Potentially not adversary behavior, but
  worth identifying to know if the software is present and being used.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_path
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `is_nirsoft_software`
  | `windows_nirsoft_utilities_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Filtering may be required before
  setting to alert.
