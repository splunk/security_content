description: The following analytic identifies the execution of commonly used NirSoft
  utilities on Windows systems. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution details such as process name, parent
  process, and command-line arguments. This activity is significant for a SOC because
  NirSoft utilities, while legitimate, can be used by adversaries for malicious purposes
  like credential theft or system reconnaissance. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.

- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_path
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")`

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Filtering may be required before
  setting to alert.
