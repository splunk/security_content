datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies usage of `wmic.exe` spawning a local
  or remote process, identified by the `node` switch. During triage, review parallel
  processes for additional commands executed. Look for any file modifications before
  and after `wmic.exe` execution. In addition, identify the remote endpoint and confirm
  execution or file modifications. Contain and isolate the endpoint as needed.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` Processes.process=*node*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_wmi_command_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product. Deprecated because duplicate of Remote Process Instantiation via
  WMI.
known_false_positives: Administrators may use this legitimately to gather info from
  remote systems. Filter as needed.
