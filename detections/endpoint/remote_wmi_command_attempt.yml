description: The following analytic detects the execution of `wmic.exe` with the `node`
  switch, indicating an attempt to spawn a local or remote process. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  creation events and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate lateral movement or remote code execution attempts by an attacker. If confirmed
  malicious, the attacker could gain remote control over the targeted system, execute
  arbitrary commands, and potentially escalate privileges or persist within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` Processes.process=*node*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_wmi_command_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may use this legitimately to gather info from
  remote systems. Filter as needed.
