description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments invoking the `GetCurrent` method of the WindowsIdentity .NET
  class. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is
  significant as adversaries may use this method to identify the logged-in user on
  a compromised endpoint, aiding in situational awareness and Active Directory discovery.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to gain insights into user context,
  potentially facilitating further exploitation and lateral movement within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="powershell.exe")
  (Processes.process=*System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity* OR Processes.process=*GetCurrent()*)

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `getcurrent_user_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
