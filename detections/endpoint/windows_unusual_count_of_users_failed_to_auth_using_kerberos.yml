description: 'The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with multiple valid users using the Kerberos protocol. This behavior could represent
  an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment
  using Kerberos to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Event 4771 is generated
  when the Key Distribution Center fails to issue a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket
  (TGT). Failure code 0x18 stands for `wrong password provided` (the attempted user
  is a legitimate domain user).\

  The detection calculates the standard deviation for each host and leverages the
  3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number of users. To customize this
  analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket` span time and the
  calculation of the `upperBound` field. This logic can be used for real time security
  monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.\

  This detection will only trigger on domain controllers, not on member servers or
  workstations.\

  The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by
  providing fields like source ip and attempted user accounts.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid domain users
  is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, missconfigured systems and
  multi-user systems like Citrix farms.
