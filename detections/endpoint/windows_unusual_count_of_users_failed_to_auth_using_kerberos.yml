description: 'The following analytic identifies a source endpoint failing to authenticate
  multiple valid users using the Kerberos protocol, potentially indicating a Password
  Spraying attack. It leverages Event 4771, which is generated when the Key Distribution
  Center fails to issue a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) due to a wrong password
  (failure code 0x18). This detection uses statistical analysis, specifically the
  3-sigma rule, to identify unusual authentication failures. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow an attacker to gain initial access or elevate privileges
  within an Active Directory environment.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid domain users
  is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, missconfigured systems and
  multi-user systems like Citrix farms.
