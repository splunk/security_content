description: Credential extraction is often an illegal recovery of credential material
  from secured authentication resources and repositories. This process may also involve
  decryption or other transformations of the stored credential material. LaZagne is
  a tool that extracts various kinds of credentials from a local computer, including
  account passwords, domain passwords, browser passwords, etc.
eli5: This detection identifies the most common LaZagne invocation, in which it is
  instructed to extract all available passwords and output them to a file. For more
  details on LaZagne see https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Windows Security logs from devices of interest,
  including the event ID 4688 with enabled command line logging.
