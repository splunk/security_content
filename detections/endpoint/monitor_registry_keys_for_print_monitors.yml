description: This search looks for registry activity associated with modifications
  to the registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors`. In this
  scenario, an attacker can load an arbitrary .dll into the print-monitor registry
  by giving the full path name to the after.dll. The system will execute the .dll
  with elevated (SYSTEM) permissions and will persist after reboot.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  products, such as Carbon Black, or via other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report registry
  modifications.
