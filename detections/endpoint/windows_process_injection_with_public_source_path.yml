description: The following analytic detects a process from a non-standard file path
  on Windows attempting to create a remote thread in another process. This is identified
  using Sysmon EventCode 8, focusing on processes not originating from typical system
  directories. This behavior is significant as it often indicates process injection,
  a technique used by adversaries to evade detection or escalate privileges. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within
  another process, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and further compromise
  of the system.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 TargetImage = "*.exe" AND NOT(SourceImage IN("C:\\Windows\\*",
  "C:\\Program File*", "%systemroot%\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by SourceImage TargetImage signature TargetProcessGuid SourceProcessGuid
  TargetProcessId SourceProcessId StartAddress EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_process_injection_with_public_source_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4
  of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Some security products or third party applications may utilize
  CreateRemoteThread, filter as needed before enabling as a notable.
