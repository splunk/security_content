description: The following analytic identifies a source endpoint failing to authenticate multiple valid users using the NTLM protocol, potentially indicating a Password Spraying attack. It leverages Event 4776 from Domain Controllers, calculating the standard deviation for each host and applying the 3-sigma rule to detect anomalies. This activity is significant as it may represent an adversary attempting to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could compromise multiple accounts, leading to unauthorized access and potential lateral movement within the network.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Domain Controller events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Credential Validation` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid domain users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems. If this detection triggers on a host other than a Domain Controller, the behavior could represent a password spraying attack against the host's local accounts.
