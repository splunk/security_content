description: This analytic identifies adversaries who manipulate the security permissions
  of specific files or directories by granting additional access. This technique is
  frequently observed in the tradecraft of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and
  coinminer scripts. The objective behind this behavior is to actively evade detection
  mechanisms and tightly control access to their associated files. By identifying
  these security permission modifications, we can improve our ability to identify
  and respond to potential threats, thereby minimizing the impact of malicious activities
  on the system.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN( "icacls.exe",
  "cacls.exe", "xcacls.exe") AND Processes.process IN ("*/grant*", "*/G*") by Processes.parent_process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Filter as needed.
