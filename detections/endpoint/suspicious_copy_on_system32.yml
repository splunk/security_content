description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious copy of file from systemroot
  folder of the windows OS. This technique is commonly used by APT or other malware
  as part of execution (LOLBIN) to run its malicious code using the available legitimate
  tool in OS. this type of event may seen or may execute of normal user in some instance
  but this is really a anomaly that needs to be check within the network.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN("cmd.exe", "powershell*","pwsh.exe", "sqlps.exe", "sqltoolsps.exe", "powershell_ise.exe")
  AND `process_copy` AND Processes.process IN("*\\Windows\\System32\*", "*\\Windows\\SysWow64\\*")
  AND Processes.process = "*copy*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `suspicious_copy_on_system32_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: every user may do this event but very un-ussual.
