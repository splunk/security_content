description: The following analytic detects the execution of 7z.exe, a 7-Zip utility,
  spawned from rundll32.exe or dllhost.exe. This behavior is identified using Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names and parent processes.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to use 7-Zip
  for data exfiltration, often by renaming the executable to evade detection. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized data archiving and exfiltration, compromising
  sensitive information and potentially leading to further system exploitation.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("rundll32.exe", "dllhost.exe") Processes.process_name=*7z* by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `anomalous_usage_of_7zip_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this behavior is not normal
  for `rundll32.exe` or `dllhost.exe` to spawn and run 7zip.
