status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following detection identifies a 7z.exe spawned from `Rundll32.exe`
  or `Dllhost.exe`. It is assumed that the adversary has brought in `7z.exe` and `7z.dll`.
  It has been observed where an adversary will rename `7z.exe`. Additional coverage
  may be required to identify the behavior of renamed instances of `7z.exe`. During
  triage, identify the source of injection into `Rundll32.exe` or `Dllhost.exe`. Capture
  any files written to disk and analyze as needed. Review parallel processes for additional
  behaviors. Typically, archiving files will result in exfiltration.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("rundll32.exe", "dllhost.exe") Processes.process_name=*7z* by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `anomalous_usage_of_7zip_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this behavior is not normal
  for `rundll32.exe` or `dllhost.exe` to spawn and run 7zip.

  message: An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified
    on endpoint $dest$ by user $user$. This behavior is indicative of suspicious loading
    of 7zip.
