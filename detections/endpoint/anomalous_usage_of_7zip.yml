description: The following detection identifies a 7z.exe spawned from `Rundll32.exe`
  or `Dllhost.exe`. It is assumed that the adversary has brought in `7z.exe` and `7z.dll`.
  It has been observed where an adversary will rename `7z.exe`. Additional coverage
  may be required to identify the behavior of renamed instances of `7z.exe`. During
  triage, identify the source of injection into `Rundll32.exe` or `Dllhost.exe`. Capture
  any files written to disk and analyze as needed. Review parallel processes for additional
  behaviors. Typically, archiving files will result in exfiltration.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("rundll32.exe", "dllhost.exe") Processes.process_name=*7z* by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `anomalous_usage_of_7zip_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this behavior is not normal
  for `rundll32.exe` or `dllhost.exe` to spawn and run 7zip.

    on endpoint $dest$ by user $user$. This behavior is indicative of suspicious loading
    of 7zip.
