description: The following analytic detects a high frequency of file copying or moving within network shares, which may indicate potential data sabotage or exfiltration attempts. It leverages Windows Security Event Logs (EventCode 5145) to monitor access to specific file types and network shares. This activity is significant as it can reveal insider threats attempting to transfer classified or internal files, potentially leading to data breaches or evidence tampering. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could result in unauthorized data access, data loss, or compromised sensitive information.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Security Event Logs with 5145 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also required. Also enable the object Audit access success/failure in your group policy.
known_false_positives: This behavior may seen in normal transfer of file within network if network share is common place for sharing documents.
