description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious high frequency copying/moving
  of files in network share as part of information sabotage. This anomaly event can
  be a good indicator of insider trying to sabotage data by transfering classified
  or internal files within network share to exfitrate it after or to lure evidence
  of insider attack to other user. This behavior may catch several noise if network
  share is a common place for classified or internal document processing.

how_to_implement: o successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows
  Security Event Logs with 5145 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also required.
  Also enable the object Audit access success/failure in your group policy.
known_false_positives: this behavior may seen in normal transfer of file within network
  if network share is common place for sharing documents.
