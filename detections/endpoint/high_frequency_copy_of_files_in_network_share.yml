description: The following analytic detects a high frequency of file copying or moving
  within network shares, which may indicate potential data sabotage or exfiltration
  attempts. It leverages Windows Security Event Logs (EventCode 5145) to monitor access
  to specific file types and network shares. This activity is significant as it can
  reveal insider threats attempting to transfer classified or internal files, potentially
  leading to data breaches or evidence tampering. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could result in unauthorized data access, data loss, or compromised sensitive information.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 5145
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=5145 RelativeTargetName IN ("*.doc","*.docx","*.xls","*.xlsx","*.ppt","*.pptx","*.log","*.txt","*.db","*.7z","*.zip","*.rar","*.tar","*.gz","*.jpg","*.gif","*.png","*.bmp","*.pdf","*.rtf","*.key")
  ObjectType=File ShareName IN ("\\\\*\\C$","\\\\*\\IPC$","\\\\*\\admin$") AccessMask=
  "0x2" |  bucket _time span=5m | stats values(RelativeTargetName) as valRelativeTargetName,
  values(ShareName) as valShareName, values(ObjectType) as valObjectType, values(AccessMask)
  as valAccessmask, values(src_port) as valSrcPort, values(SourceAddress) as valSrcAddress
  count as numShareName by dest, _time, EventCode, src_user, src_ip | eventstats avg(numShareName)
  as avgShareName, stdev(numShareName) as stdShareName, count as numSlots by dest,
  _time, EventCode, src_user |  eval upperThreshold=(avgShareName + stdShareName *3)
  |  eval isOutlier=if(avgShareName > 20 and avgShareName >= upperThreshold, 1, 0)
  |  search isOutlier=1  | `high_frequency_copy_of_files_in_network_share_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 5145 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required. Also enable the object Audit access success/failure in your group policy.
known_false_positives: This behavior may seen in normal transfer of file within network
  if network share is common place for sharing documents.
