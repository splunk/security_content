description: This search is designed to detect suspicious cmd and powershell process
  spawned by wermgr.exe process. This suspicious behavior are commonly seen in code
  injection technique technique like trickbot to execute a shellcode, dll modules
  to run malicious behavior.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as cmdline
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.parent_process_name = "wermgr.exe" `process_cmd` OR `process_powershell`
  by Processes.parent_process_name  Processes.original_file_name Processes.parent_process_id  Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `wermgr_process_spawned_cmd_or_powershell_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
