- Endpoint
description: This search is designed to detect suspicious cmd and powershell process
  spawned by wermgr.exe process. This suspicious behavior are commonly seen in code
  injection technique technique like trickbot to execute a shellcode, dll modules
  to run malicious behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as cmdline
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.parent_process_name = "wermgr.exe" Processes.process_name = "cmd.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "powershell.exe" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process_id  Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `wermgr_process_spawned_cmd_or_powershell_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
