name: Allow Network Discovery In Firewall

type: TTP
description: This search is to detect a suspicious modification to the firewall to
  allow network discovery on a machine. This technique was seen in couple of ransomware
  (revil, reddot) to discover other machine connected to the compromised host to encrypt
  more files.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_netsh` Processes.process=
  "*firewall*" Processes.process= "*group=\"Network Discovery\"*"  Processes.process="*enable*"
  Processes.process="*Yes*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `allow_network_discovery_in_firewall_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network admin may modify this firewall feature that may cause
  this rule to be triggered.
