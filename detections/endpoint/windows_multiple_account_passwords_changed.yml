status: production
description: The following analytic detects instances where more than five unique
  Windows account passwords are changed within a 10-minute interval. It leverages
  Event Code 4724 from the Windows Security Event Log, using the wineventlog_security
  dataset to monitor and count distinct TargetUserName values. This behavior is significant
  as rapid password changes across multiple accounts are unusual and may indicate
  unauthorized access or internal compromise. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could lead to widespread account compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive information,
  and potential disruption of services.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4724 status=success | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats count dc(user) as unique_users values(user) as user by EventCode signature
  _time src_user SubjectDomainName TargetDomainName Logon_ID | where unique_users
  > 5 | `windows_multiple_account_passwords_changed_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events with the Windows TA. The Advanced Security Audit policy
  setting `Audit User Account Management` within `Account Management` needs to be
  enabled.
known_false_positives: Service accounts may be responsible for the creation, deletion
  or modification of accounts for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
