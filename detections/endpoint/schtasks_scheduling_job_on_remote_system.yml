datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `schtasks.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to create a Scheduled Task on a remote endpoint. Red Teams and
  adversaries alike may abuse the Task Scheduler for lateral movement and remote code
  execution.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name = schtasks.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=schtasks.exe) (Processes.process="*/create*" AND
  Processes.process="*/s*") by Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `schtasks_scheduling_job_on_remote_system_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
known_false_positives: Administrators may create scheduled tasks on remote systems,
  but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users. It is important
  to validate and investigate as appropriate.
