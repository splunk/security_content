description: This search looks for flags passed to schtasks.exe on the command-line
  that indicate a job is being scheduled on a remote system.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.

known_false_positives: Administrators may create jobs on remote systems, but this
  activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users. It is important to
  validate and investigate as appropriate.
