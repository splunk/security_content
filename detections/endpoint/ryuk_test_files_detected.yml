description: The following analytic identifies the presence of files containing the
  keyword "Ryuk" in any folder on the C drive, indicative of Ryuk ransomware activity.
  It leverages the Endpoint Filesystem data model to detect file paths matching this
  pattern. This activity is significant as Ryuk ransomware is known for its destructive
  impact, encrypting critical files and demanding ransom. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to significant data loss, operational disruption, and financial
  damage due to ransom payments and recovery efforts. Immediate investigation and
  response are crucial to mitigate potential damage.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem WHERE "Filesystem.file_path"=C:\\*Ryuk*
  BY "Filesystem.dest", "Filesystem.user", "Filesystem.file_path" | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `ryuk_test_files_detected_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint Filesystem data-model object. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
known_false_positives: If there are files with this keywoord as file names it might
  trigger false possitives, please make use of our filters to tune out potential FPs.
