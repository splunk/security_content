description: The search looks for files that contain the key word *Ryuk* under any
  folder in the C drive, which is consistent with Ryuk propagation.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint Filesystem data-model object. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
