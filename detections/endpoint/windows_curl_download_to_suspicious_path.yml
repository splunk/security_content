description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of Windows Curl.exe downloading
  a file to a suspicious location. \

  -O or --output is used when a file is to be downloaded and placed in a specified
  location. \

  During triage, review parallel processes for further behavior. In addition, identify
  if the download was successful. If a file was downloaded, capture and analyze.'
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_curl` Processes.process
  IN ("*-O *","*--output*") Processes.process IN ("*\\appdata\\*","*\\programdata\\*","*\\public\\*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

  | `windows_curl_download_to_suspicious_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: It is possible Administrators or super users will use Curl
  for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
