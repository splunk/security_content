description: The following analytic detects the execution of the Windows OS tool cmdkey.exe,
  which is used to create stored usernames, passwords, or credentials. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  execution logs and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because
  cmdkey.exe is often abused by post-exploitation tools and malware, such as Darkgate,
  to gain unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
  to escalate privileges and maintain persistence on the targeted host, facilitating
  further attacks and potential data breaches.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="cmdkey.exe"
  OR Processes.original_file_name = "cmdkey.exe" AND Processes.process = "*/generic*"
  Processes.process IN ("*/user*", "*/password*") by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.
