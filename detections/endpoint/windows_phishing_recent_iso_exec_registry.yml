description: The following hunting analytic identifies registry artifacts when an
  ISO container is opened, clicked or mounted on the Windows operating system. As
  Microsoft makes changes to macro based document execution, adversaries have begun
  to utilize container based initial access based phishing campaigns to evade preventative
  controls. Once the ISO is clicked or mounted it will create a registry artifact
  related to this event as a recent application executed or opened.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_key_name= "*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\RecentDocs\\.iso"
  OR Registry.registry_key_name= "*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\RecentDocs\\.img"

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_phishing_recent_iso_exec_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be high depending on the environment and
  consistent use of ISOs. Restrict to servers, or filter out based on commonly used
  ISO names. Filter as needed.
