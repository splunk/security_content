description: This search detects writes to the 'System Volume Information' folder
  by something other than the System process.
how_to_implement: You need to be ingesting logs with both the process name and command-line
  from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4
  of the Sysmon TA.
