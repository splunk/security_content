description: The following analytic identifies instances where explorer.exe is spawned
  by unusual parent processes such as cmd.exe, powershell.exe, or regsvr32.exe. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process and parent process relationships. This activity is significant because
  explorer.exe is typically initiated by userinit.exe, and deviations from this norm
  can indicate code injection or process masquerading attempts by malware like Qakbot.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code, evade detection, and maintain persistence within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN("cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "regsvr32.exe") AND Processes.process_name = "explorer.exe"
  AND Processes.process IN ("*\\explorer.exe") by Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
