datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies the Microsoft Software Licensing User
  Interface Tool, `slui.exe`, spawning a child process. This behavior is associated
  with publicly known UAC bypass. `slui.exe` is commonly associated with software
  updates and is most often spawned by `svchost.exe`. The `slui.exe` process should
  not have child processes, and any processes spawning from it will be running with
  elevated privileges. During triage, review the child process and additional parallel
  processes. Identify any file modifications that may have lead to the bypass.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=slui.exe
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `slui_spawning_a_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Certain applications may spawn from `slui.exe` that are legitimate.
  Filtering will be needed to ensure proper monitoring.
