description: The following analytic identifies the Microsoft Software Licensing User
  Interface Tool, `slui.exe`, spawning a child process. This behavior is associated
  with publicly known UAC bypass. `slui.exe` is commonly associated with software
  updates and is most often spawned by `svchost.exe`. The `slui.exe` process should
  not have child processes, and any processes spawning from it will be running with
  elevated privileges. During triage, review the child process and additional parallel
  processes. Identify any file modifications that may have lead to the bypass.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=slui.exe
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `slui_spawning_a_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Certain applications may spawn from `slui.exe` that are legitimate.
  Filtering will be needed to ensure proper monitoring.
