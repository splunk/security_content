description: The following analytic detects the Microsoft Software Licensing User
  Interface Tool (`slui.exe`) spawning a child process. This behavior is identified
  using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process creation
  events where `slui.exe` is the parent process. This activity is significant because
  `slui.exe` should not typically spawn child processes, and doing so may indicate
  a UAC bypass attempt, leading to elevated privileges. If confirmed malicious, an
  attacker could leverage this to execute code with elevated privileges, potentially
  compromising the system's security and gaining unauthorized access.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Certain applications may spawn from `slui.exe` that are legitimate.
  Filtering will be needed to ensure proper monitoring.
