description: The following analytic detects the use of PowerShell commands to add
  or set Windows Defender exclusions. It leverages EventCode 4104 to identify suspicious
  `Add-MpPreference` or `Set-MpPreference` commands with exclusion parameters. This
  activity is significant because adversaries often use it to bypass Windows Defender,
  allowing malicious code to execute without detection. If confirmed malicious, this
  behavior could enable attackers to evade antivirus defenses, maintain persistence,
  and execute further malicious activities undetected.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText = "*Add-MpPreference *" OR ScriptBlockText
  = "*Set-MpPreference *") AND ScriptBlockText = "*-exclusion*" | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer UserID
  | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `powershell_windows_defender_exclusion_commands_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
