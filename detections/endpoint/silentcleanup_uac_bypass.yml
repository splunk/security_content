type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious modification of registry that may
  related to UAC bypassed. This registry will be trigger once the attacker abuse the
  silentcleanup task schedule to gain high privilege execution that will bypass User
  control account.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Environment\\windir"
  Registry.registry_value_name = "*.exe*" by Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name
  Registry.registry_value_name Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `silentcleanup_uac_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
