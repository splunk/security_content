description: The following analytic detects suspicious modifications to the registry that may indicate a UAC (User Account Control) bypass attempt via the SilentCleanup task. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on registry changes in the path "*\\Environment\\windir" with executable values. This activity is significant as it can allow an attacker to gain high-privilege execution without user consent, bypassing UAC protections. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized administrative access, enabling further system compromise and persistence.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
