description: The following analytic leverages Event IDs 5140 or 5145 to identify a
  source computer accessing windows administrative shares (C$, Admin$ and IPC$ ) across
  a large number remote endpoints. Specifically, the logic will trigger when a source
  endpoint accesses administrative shares across 30 or more target computers within
  a 5 minute timespan. This behavior could represent an adversary who is enumerating
  network shares across an Active Directory environment in the search for sensitive
  files, a common technique leveraged by red teamers and threat actors. As environments
  differ across organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this
  detection as needed.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=5140 OR EventCode=5145 (ShareName="\\\\*\\ADMIN$"
  OR ShareName="\\\\*\\IPC$" OR ShareName="\\\\*\\C$") | bucket span=5m _time | stats
  dc(Computer) AS unique_targets values(Computer) as host_targets values(ShareName)
  as shares by _time, IpAddress, SubjectUserName, EventCode | where unique_targets
  > 30 | `windows_administrative_shares_accessed_on_multiple_hosts_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  file share events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Detailed File
  Share` or `Audit File Share` within `Object Access` need to be enabled.
known_false_positives: An single endpoint accessing windows administrative shares
  across a large number of endpoints is not common behavior. Possible false positive
  scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, administration
  systems and missconfigured systems.
