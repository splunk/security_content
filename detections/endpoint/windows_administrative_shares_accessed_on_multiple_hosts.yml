description: The following analytic leverages Event IDs 5140 or 5145 to identify a source computer accessing windows administrative shares (C$, Admin$ and IPC$ ) across a large number
  remote endpoints. Specifically, the logic will trigger when a source endpoint accesses administrative shares across 30 or more target computers within a 5 minute timespan. This behavior could 
  represent an adversary who is enumerating network shares across an Active Directory environment in the search for sensitive files, a common technique leveraged by red teamers and threat actors.
  As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this detection as needed.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=5140 OR EventCode=5145 (ShareName="\\\\*\\ADMIN$" OR ShareName="\\\\*\\IPC$" OR ShareName="\\\\*\\C$")
  | bucket span=5m _time
  | stats dc(Computer) AS unique_targets values(Computer) as host_targets values(ShareName) as shares by _time, IpAddress, SubjectUserName, EventCode
  | where unique_targets > 30
  | `windows_administrative_shares_accessed_on_multiple_hosts_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting file share events.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Detailed File Share` or `Audit File Share` within `Object Access` need to be enabled.
known_false_positives: An single endpoint accessing windows administrative shares across a large number of endpoints is not common behavior.
  Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, administration systems and missconfigured systems.
