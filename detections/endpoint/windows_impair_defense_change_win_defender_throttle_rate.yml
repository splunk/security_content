description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to change the ThrottleDetectionEventsRate of Windows Defender.
  The ThrottleDetectionEventsRate registry setting in Windows Defender is related to controlling the rate at which detection events are logged or 
  reported by Windows Defender Antivirus.
  This registry setting determines how frequently Windows Defender logs or reports detection events. Adjusting the ThrottleDetectionEventsRate value 
  can impact the logging frequency of detection events such as malware detections, scanning results, or security-related events recorded by Windows Defender.
  A higher value might mean that detection events are reported less frequently, potentially reducing the volume of recorded events, while a lower value could 
  increase the reporting frequency, resulting in more frequent logs of detection events.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
