description: The following analytic detects modifications to the ThrottleDetectionEventsRate
  registry setting in Windows Defender. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
  datamodel to identify changes in the registry path related to Windows Defender's
  event logging rate. This activity is significant because altering the ThrottleDetectionEventsRate
  can reduce the frequency of logged detection events, potentially masking malicious
  activities. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to evade detection
  by decreasing the visibility of security events, thereby hindering incident response
  and forensic investigations.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\NIS\\Consumers\\IPS\\ThrottleDetectionEventsRate" by Registry.registry_key_name
  Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action
  Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_change_win_defender_throttle_rate_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
