description: The following analytic detects the modification of the registry to disable
  Windows Defender's Enhanced Notification feature. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, specifically monitoring changes to the registry
  path associated with Windows Defender reporting. This activity is significant because
  disabling Enhanced Notifications can prevent users and administrators from receiving
  critical security alerts, potentially allowing malicious activities to go unnoticed.
  If confirmed malicious, this action could enable an attacker to bypass detection
  mechanisms, maintain persistence, and escalate their activities without triggering
  alerts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
