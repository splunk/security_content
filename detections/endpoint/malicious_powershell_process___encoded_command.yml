description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of the EncodedCommand PowerShell
  parameter. This is typically used by Administrators to run complex scripts, but
  commonly used by adversaries to hide their code. \

  The analytic identifies all variations of EncodedCommand, as PowerShell allows the
  ability to shorten the parameter. For example enc, enco, encod and so forth. In
  addition, through our research it was identified that PowerShell will interpret
  different command switch types beyond the hyphen. We have added endash, emdash,
  horizontal bar, and forward slash. \

  During triage, review parallel events to determine legitimacy. Tune as needed based
  on admin scripts in use. \

  Alternatively, may use regex per matching here https://regexr.com/662ov.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: System administrators may use this option, but it's not common.
