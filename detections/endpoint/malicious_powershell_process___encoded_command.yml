description: This search looks for PowerShell processes that have encoded the script
  within the command-line. Malware has been seen using this parameter, as it obfuscates
  the code and makes it relatively easy to pass a script on the command-line.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.

known_false_positives: System administrators may use this option, but it's not common.
