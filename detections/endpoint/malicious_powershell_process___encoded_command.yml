datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search looks for PowerShell processes that have encoded the script
  within the command-line. Malware has been seen using this parameter, as it obfuscates
  the code and makes it relatively easy to pass a script on the command-line.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell` (Processes.process=*-EncodedCommand*
  OR Processes.process=*-enc*) by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.dest Processes.process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `malicious_powershell_process___encoded_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: System administrators may use this option, but it's not common.
