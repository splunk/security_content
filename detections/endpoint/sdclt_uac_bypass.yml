description: The following analytic detects suspicious modifications to the sdclt.exe
  registry, a technique often used to bypass User Account Control (UAC). It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific registry
  paths and values associated with sdclt.exe. This activity is significant because
  UAC bypasses can allow attackers to execute payloads with elevated privileges without
  user consent. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution,
  privilege escalation, and potential persistence within the environment, posing a
  severe security risk.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited to no false positives are expected.
