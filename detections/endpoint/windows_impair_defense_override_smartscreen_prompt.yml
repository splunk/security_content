description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that override the Windows Defender SmartScreen prompt. It leverages data from the
  Endpoint.Registry data model, specifically monitoring changes to the "PreventSmartScreenPromptOverride"
  registry setting. This activity is significant because it indicates an attempt to
  disable the prevention of user overrides for SmartScreen prompts, potentially allowing
  users to bypass security warnings. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to users
  inadvertently executing or accessing harmful content, increasing the risk of security
  incidents or system compromises.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry 
  WHERE Registry.registry_path= "*\\Microsoft\\Edge\\PreventSmartScreenPromptOverride"
  Registry.registry_value_data= "0x00000000" BY Registry.dest Registry.user
  Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_override_smartscreen_prompt_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
