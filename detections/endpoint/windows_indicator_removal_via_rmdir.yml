description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'rmdir' command with
  '/s' and '/q' options to delete files and directory trees. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  executions and process metadata. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  malware attempting to remove traces or components during cleanup operations. If
  confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to eliminate forensic evidence,
  hinder incident response efforts, and maintain persistence by removing indicators
  of compromise.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*rmdir*"
  Processes.process = "* /s *" Processes.process = "* /q *" by Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_indicator_removal_via_rmdir_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: user and network administrator can execute this command.
