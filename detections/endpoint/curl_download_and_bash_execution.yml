description: The following analytic identifies the use of curl on Linux or MacOS attempting
  to download a file from a remote source and pipe it to bash. This is typically found
  with coinminers and most recently with CVE-2021-44228, a vulnerability in Log4j.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=curl
  (Processes.process="*-s *") OR (Processes.process="*|*" AND Processes.process="*bash*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `curl_download_and_bash_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon for Linux, you will need to ensure mapping is
  occurring correctly. If the EDR is not parsing the pipe bash in the command-line,
  modifying the analytic will be required. Add parent process name (Processes.parent_process_name)
  as needed to filter.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however filtering may be
  required.
