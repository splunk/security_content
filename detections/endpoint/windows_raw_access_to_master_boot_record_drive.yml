description: The following analytic detects suspicious raw access reads to the drive
  containing the Master Boot Record (MBR). It leverages Sysmon EventCode 9 to identify
  processes attempting to read or write to the MBR sector, excluding legitimate system
  processes. This activity is significant because adversaries often target the MBR
  to wipe, encrypt, or overwrite it as part of their impact payload. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to system instability, data loss, or a complete system
  compromise, severely impacting the organization's operations.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 9
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=9 Device = \\Device\\Harddisk0\\DR0 NOT (Image IN("*\\Windows\\System32\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by Computer Image Device ProcessGuid ProcessId EventDescription EventCode
  | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_raw_access_to_master_boot_record_drive_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the raw access read event (like sysmon eventcode 9), process name and
  process guid from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: This event is really notable but we found minimal number of
  normal application from system32 folder like svchost.exe accessing it too. In this
  case we used 'system32' and 'syswow64' path as a filter for this detection.
