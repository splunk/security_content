description: This analytic is to look for suspicious raw access read to drive where
  the master boot record is placed. This technique was seen in several attacks by
  adversaries or threat actor to wipe, encrypt or overwrite the master boot record
  code as part of their impact payload. This detection is a good indicator that there
  is a process try to read or write on MBR sector.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 9
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=9 Device = \\Device\\Harddisk0\\DR0 NOT (Image IN("*\\Windows\\System32\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by Computer Image Device ProcessGuid ProcessId EventDescription EventCode
  | rename Computer as dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_raw_access_to_master_boot_record_drive_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the raw access read event (like sysmon eventcode 9), process name and
  process guid from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: This event is really notable but we found minimal number of
  normal application from system32 folder like svchost.exe accessing it too. In this
  case we used 'system32' and 'syswow64' path as a filter for this detection.
