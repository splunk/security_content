description: The following analytic detects the creation of a new Group Policy Object
  (GPO) by leveraging Event IDs 5136 and 5137. This detection uses directory service
  change events to identify when a new GPO is created. Monitoring GPO creation is
  crucial as adversaries can exploit GPOs to escalate privileges or deploy malware
  across an Active Directory network. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  allow attackers to control system configurations, deploy ransomware, or propagate
  malware, leading to widespread compromise and significant operational disruption.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=5137 OR (EventCode=5136 AttributeValue!="New
  Group Policy Object" AND (AttributeLDAPDisplayName=displayName OR AttributeLDAPDisplayName=gPCFileSysPath)
  ) ObjectClass=groupPolicyContainer | stats values(AttributeValue) as details values(SubjectUserSid)
  as User values(ObjectDN) as ObjectDN by ObjectGUID Computer | eval GPO_Name = mvindex(details,
  0) | eval GPO_Path = mvindex(details, 1) | fields - details | `windows_group_policy_object_created_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, the Advanced Security Audit
  policy setting `Audit Directory Service Changes` within `DS Access` needs to be
  enabled. Furthermore, the appropriate system access control lists (SACL) need to
  be created as the used events are not logged by default. A good guide to accomplish
  this can be found here https://jgspiers.com/audit-group-policy-changes/.
known_false_positives: Group Policy Objects are created as part of regular administrative
  operations, filter as needed.
