description: "The following analytic detects modifications to files with extensions
  commonly associated with ransomware. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem data model
  to identify changes in file extensions that match known ransomware patterns. This
  activity is significant because it suggests an attacker is attempting to encrypt
  or alter files, potentially leading to severe data loss and operational disruption.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could result in the encryption of critical
  data, rendering it inaccessible and causing significant damage to the organization's
  data integrity and availability."

how_to_implement: 'You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint Filesystem data model node. To see the
  additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, please review
  the detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may
  be found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`'
known_false_positives: It is possible for a legitimate file with these extensions
  to be created. If this is a true ransomware attack, there will be a large number
  of files created with these extensions.
