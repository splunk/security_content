description: The search looks for file modifications with extensions commonly used
  by Ransomware
how_to_implement: 'You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data model node. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.\

  This search produces fields (`query`,`query_length`,`count`) that are not yet supported
  by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised.
  These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional
  metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review -
  Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add
  New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** Name, **Field:** Name\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** File Extension, **Field:** file_extension\

  Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be
  found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`'

known_false_positives: It is possible for a legitimate file with these extensions
  to be created. If this is a true ransomware attack, there will be a large number
  of files created with these extensions.
