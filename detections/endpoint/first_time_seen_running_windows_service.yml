description: The following analytic detects the first occurrence of a Windows service
  running in your environment. It leverages Windows system event logs, specifically
  EventCode 7036, to identify services entering the "running" state. This activity
  is significant because the appearance of a new or previously unseen service could
  indicate the installation of unauthorized or malicious software. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, maintain persistence,
  or escalate privileges within the environment. Monitoring for new services helps
  in early detection of potential threats.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log System 7036
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7036 | rex field=Message "The (?<service>[-\(\)\s\w]+)
  service entered the (?<state>\w+) state" | where state="running" | lookup previously_seen_running_windows_services
  service as service OUTPUT firstTimeSeen | where isnull(firstTimeSeen) OR firstTimeSeen
  > relative_time(now(), `previously_seen_windows_services_window`) | table _time
  dest service | `first_time_seen_running_windows_service_filter`'
how_to_implement: While this search does not require you to adhere to Splunk CIM,
  you must be ingesting your Windows system event logs in order for this search to
  execute successfully. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Running
  Windows Services - Initial` to build the initial table of child processes and hostnames
  for this search to work. You should also schedule at the same interval as this search
  the second baseline search `Previously Seen Running Windows Services - Update` to
  keep this table up to date and to age out old Windows Services. Please update the
  `previously_seen_windows_services_window` macro to adjust the time window. Please
  ensure that the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows is version 8.0.0 or above.
known_false_positives: A previously unseen service is not necessarily malicious. Verify
  that the service is legitimate and that was installed by a legitimate process.
