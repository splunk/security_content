description: The following analytic detects the creation of files in Linux init boot
  directories, which are used for automatic execution upon system startup. It leverages
  file system logs to identify new files in directories such as /etc/init.d/ and /etc/rc.d/.
  This activity is significant as it is a common persistence technique used by adversaries,
  malware authors, and red teamers. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to maintain persistence on the compromised host, potentially leading to further
  exploitation and unauthorized control over the system.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/init.d/*",
  "*/etc/rc.d/*", "*/sbin/init.d/*", "*/etc/rc.local*") by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_name
  Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_file_creation_in_init_boot_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create file in this folders
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
