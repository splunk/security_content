description: This analytic looks for suspicious file creation on init system directories
  for automatic execution of script or file upon boot up. This technique is commonly
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamer to persist on the targeted or
  compromised host. This behavior can be executed or use by an administrator or network
  operator to add script files or binary files as part of a task or automation. filter
  is needed.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/init.d/*",
  "*/etc/rc.d/*", "*/sbin/init.d/*", "*/etc/rc.local*") by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_name
  Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_file_creation_in_init_boot_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create file in this folders
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
