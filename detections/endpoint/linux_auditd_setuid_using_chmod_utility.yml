description: The following analytic detects the execution of the chmod utility to
  set the SUID or SGID bit on files, which can allow users to temporarily gain root
    or group-level access. This detection leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on process names and command-line arguments related
  to chmod. This activity is significant as it can indicate an attempt to escalate
  privileges or maintain persistence on a system. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could gain elevated access, potentially compromising sensitive data or critical
  system functions.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process` | rename host
  as dest | where LIKE (process_exec, "%chmod %") AND (LIKE (process_exec, "% u+s
  %") OR LIKE (process_exec, "% g+s %") OR LIKE (process_exec, "% 4777 %") OR LIKE
  (process_exec, "% 4577 %")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_setuid_using_chmod_utility_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
