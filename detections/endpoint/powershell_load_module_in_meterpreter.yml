description: 'The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the command
  sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs will output
  to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable on critical endpoints or all.
  \

  This analytic identifies "MSF.Powershell","MSF.Powershell.Meterpreter","MSF.Powershell.Meterpreter.Kiwi","MSF.Powershell.Meterpreter.Transport" being used. This behavior is related to when a Meterpreter session is started and the operator runs load_kiwi. \
  
  During triage, review parallel processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It
  will be important to understand the timeline of events around this activity. Review
  the entire logged PowerShell script block.'

how_to_implement: The following analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: False positives should be very limited as this is strict to MetaSploit behavior.
