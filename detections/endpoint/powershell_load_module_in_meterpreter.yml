description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of suspicious PowerShell
  commands associated with Meterpreter modules, such as "MSF.Powershell" and "MSF.Powershell.Meterpreter".
  It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to capture and analyze
  the full command sent to PowerShell. This activity is significant as it indicates
  potential post-exploitation actions, including credential dumping and persistence
  mechanisms. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain extensive control over
  the compromised system, escalate privileges, and maintain long-term access, posing
  a severe threat to the environment.'
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN ("*MSF.Powershell*","*MSF.Powershell.Meterpreter*","*MSF.Powershell.Meterpreter.Kiwi*","*MSF.Powershell.Meterpreter.Transport*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer user_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_load_module_in_meterpreter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic requires PowerShell operational logs to be
  imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or add index.
  This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: False positives should be very limited as this is strict to
  MetaSploit behavior.
