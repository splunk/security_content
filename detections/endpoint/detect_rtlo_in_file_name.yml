description: The following analytic identifies the use of the right-to-left override
  (RTLO) character in file names. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Filesystem datamodel,
  specifically focusing on file creation events and file names containing the RTLO
  character (U+202E). This activity is significant because adversaries use RTLO to
  disguise malicious files as benign by reversing the text that follows the character.
  If confirmed malicious, this technique can deceive users and security tools, leading
  to the execution of harmful files and potential system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(Filesystem.file_create_time) as file_create_time from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where Filesystem.file_name!=unknown by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.user Filesystem.process_id
  Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | regex
  file_name =  "\\x{202E}" | rex field=file_name "(?<RTLO_file_1>.+)(?<RTLO_exist_file>\\x{202E})(?<RTLO_file_2>.+)"
  | eval file_name_with_RTLO=file_name | eval file_name=RTLO_file_1.RTLO_file_2 |
  fields - RTLO* | `detect_rtlo_in_file_name_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that includes the full command line of the process being launched on
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Implementation in regions that use right to left in native
  language.
