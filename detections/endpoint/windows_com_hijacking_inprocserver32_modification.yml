description: The following analytic detects the modification of the InProcServer32
  registry key by reg.exe, indicative of potential COM hijacking. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and
  command-line execution logs. COM hijacking is significant as it allows adversaries
  to insert malicious code that executes in place of legitimate software, providing
  a means for persistence. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable attackers
  to execute arbitrary code, disrupt legitimate system components, and maintain long-term
  access to the compromised environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_reg` Processes.process=*inprocserver32*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_com_hijacking_inprocserver32_modification_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and some filtering may be required.
