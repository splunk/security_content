description: The following analytic identifies the use of reg.exe performing an add
  to the InProcServer32, which may be related to COM hijacking. Adversaries can use
  the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate
  software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.
  Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference
  to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when
  executed. When that system component is executed through normal system operation
  the adversary's code will be executed instead.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_reg` Processes.process=*inprocserver32*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_com_hijacking_inprocserver32_modification_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and some filtering may be required.
