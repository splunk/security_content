description: This search looks for modifications to registry keys that can be used
  to elevate privileges. The registry keys under "Image File Execution Options" are
  used to intercept calls to an executable and can be used to attach malicious binaries
  to benign system binaries.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  products, such as Carbon Black, or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where (Registry.registry_path="*Microsoft\\Windows
  NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options*") AND (Registry.registry_key_name=GlobalFlag
  OR Registry.registry_key_name=Debugger) by Registry.dest  Registry.user Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_key_name | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `registry_keys_used_for_privilege_escalation_filter`'
known_false_positives: There are many legitimate applications that must execute upon
  system startup and will use these registry keys to accomplish that task.
