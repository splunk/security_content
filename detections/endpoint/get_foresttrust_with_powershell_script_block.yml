description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of the Get-ForestTrust
  command from PowerSploit using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104).
  This method captures the full command sent to PowerShell, providing detailed visibility
  into potentially suspicious activities. Monitoring this behavior is crucial as it
  can indicate an attempt to gather domain trust information, which is often a precursor
  to lateral movement or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow an attacker to map trust relationships within the domain, facilitating
  further exploitation and access to sensitive resources.'
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*get-foresttrust*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `get_foresttrust_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune as needed.
