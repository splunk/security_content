description: 'The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify suspicious PowerShell execution. Script Block Logging captures the command
  sent to PowerShell, the full command to be executed. Upon enabling, logs will output
  to Windows event logs. Dependent upon volume, enable on critical endpoints or all.
  

  This analytic identifies Get-ForestTrust from PowerSploit in order to gather domain
  trust information. 

  During triage, review parallel processes using an EDR product or 4688 events. It
  will be important to understand the timeline of events around this activity. Review
  the entire logged PowerShell script block.'
data_source:
- Powershell 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*get-foresttrust*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `get_foresttrust_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune as needed.
