- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies based on process execution the modification of SSH Authorized Keys. Adversaries perform this behavior to persist on endpoints.
  During triage, review parallel processes and capture any additional file modifications for review. 
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process_name IN ("bash","cat") Processes.process IN ("*/authorized_keys*")
   by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `linux_ssh_authorized_keys_modification_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Filtering will be required as system administrators will add and remove. One way to filter query is to add "echo".
