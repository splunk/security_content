description: The following analytic detects the modification of SSH Authorized Keys
  on Linux systems. It leverages process execution data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, specifically monitoring commands like "bash" and "cat" interacting
  with "authorized_keys" files. This activity is significant as adversaries often
  modify SSH Authorized Keys to establish persistent access to compromised endpoints.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to maintain unauthorized
  access, bypassing traditional authentication mechanisms and potentially leading
  to further exploitation or data exfiltration.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process_name IN ("bash","cat")
  Processes.process IN ("*/authorized_keys*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_ssh_authorized_keys_modification_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Filtering will be required as system administrators will add
  and remove. One way to filter query is to add "echo".
