name: Suspicious WAV file in Appdata Folder

description: The following analytic detects the creation of .wav files in the AppData
  folder, a behavior associated with Remcos RAT malware, which stores audio recordings
  in this location for data exfiltration. The detection leverages endpoint process
  and filesystem data to identify .wav file creation within the AppData\Roaming directory.
  This activity is significant as it indicates potential unauthorized data collection
  and exfiltration by malware. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to sensitive
  information being sent to an attacker's command and control server, compromising
  the affected system's confidentiality.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, file_name, file_path and command-line
  executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
