description: This search looks for events where `PsExec.exe` is run with the `accepteula`
  flag in the command line. PsExec is a built-in Windows utility that enables you
  to execute processes on other systems. It is fully interactive for console applications.
  This tool is widely used for launching interactive command prompts on remote systems.
  Threat actors leverage this extensively for executing code on compromised systems.
  If an attacker is running PsExec for the first time, they will be prompted to accept
  the end-user license agreement (EULA), which can be passed as the argument `accepteula`
  within the command line.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_psexec` Processes.process=*accepteula* by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_psexec_with_accepteula_flag_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators can leverage PsExec for accessing remote systems
  and might pass `accepteula` as an argument if they are running this tool for the
  first time. However, it is not likely that you'd see multiple occurrences of this
  event on a machine
