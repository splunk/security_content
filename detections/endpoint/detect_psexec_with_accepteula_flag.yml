description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `PsExec.exe` with
  the `accepteula` flag in the command line. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments.
  This activity is significant because PsExec is commonly used by threat actors to
  execute code on remote systems, and the `accepteula` flag indicates first-time usage,
  which could signify initial compromise. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  allow attackers to gain remote code execution capabilities, potentially leading
  to further system compromise and lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_psexec` Processes.process=*accepteula* by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_psexec_with_accepteula_flag_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators can leverage PsExec for accessing remote systems
  and might pass `accepteula` as an argument if they are running this tool for the
  first time. However, it is not likely that you'd see multiple occurrences of this
  event on a machine
