status: production
type: Correlation
description: This correlation find exploitation of Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228 against
  systems using detections from Splunk Security Content Analytic Story. It does this
  by calculating the distinct count of MITRE ATT&CK tactics from Log4Shell detections
  fired. If the count is larger than 2 or more distinct MITRE ATT&CK tactics we assume
  high problability of exploitation. The Analytic story breaks down into 3 major phases
  of a Log4Shell exploitation, specifically> Initial Payload delivery eg. `${jndi:ldap://PAYLOAD_INJECTED}`
  Call back to malicious LDAP server eg. Exploit.class Post Exploitation Activity/Lateral
  Movement using Powershell or similar T1562.001 Each of these phases fall into different
  MITRE ATT&CK Tactics (Initial Access, Execution, Command And Control), by looking
  into 2 or more phases showing up in detections triggerd is how this correlation
  search finds exploitation. If we get a notable from this correlation search the
  best way to triage it is by investigating the affected systems against Log4Shell
  exploitation using Splunk SOAR playbooks.

how_to_implement: To implement this correlation search a user needs to enable all
  detections in the Log4Shell Analytic Story and confirm it is generation risk events.
  A simple search `index=risk analyticstories="Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228"` should contain
  events.
known_false_positives: There are no known false positive for this search, but it could
  contain false positives as multiple detections can trigger and not have successful
  exploitation.
