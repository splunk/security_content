description: The following analytic detects the installation of a Windows Service
  with a suspicious, high-entropy name, indicating potential malicious activity. It
  leverages Event ID 7045 and the `ut_shannon` function from the URL ToolBox Splunk
  application to identify services with random names. This behavior is significant
  as adversaries often use randomly named services for lateral movement and remote
  code execution. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute
  arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log System 7045
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 | lookup ut_shannon_lookup word as Service_Name
  | where ut_shannon > 3 | table EventCode ComputerName Service_Name ut_shannon Service_Start_Type
  Service_Type Service_File_Name | `randomly_generated_windows_service_name_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints. The Windows TA as well as the URL ToolBox application are also
  required.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may use random Windows Service names.
