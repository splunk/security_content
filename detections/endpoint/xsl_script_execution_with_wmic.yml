name: XSL Script Execution With WMIC

description: The following analytic detects the execution of an XSL script using the
  WMIC process, which is often indicative of malicious activity. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
  involving WMIC and XSL files. This behavior is significant as it has been associated
  with the FIN7 group, known for using this technique to execute malicious scripts.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code, potentially leading to system compromise and further malicious actions within
  the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` Processes.process
  = "*os get*" Processes.process="*/format:*" Processes.process = "*.xsl*" by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `xsl_script_execution_with_wmic_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
