author: Teoderick Contreras, Splunk
type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious wmic.exe process or renamed wmic
  process to execute malicious xsl file. This technique was seen in FIN7 to execute
  its malicous jscript using the .xsl as the loader with the help of wmic.exe process.
  This TTP is really a good indicator for you to hunt further for FIN7 or other attacker
  that known to used this technique.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*os get*"
  Processes.process="*/format:*" Processes.process = "*.xsl*" by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `xsl_script_execution_with_wmic_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
