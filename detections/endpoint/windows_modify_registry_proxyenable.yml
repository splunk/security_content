description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to enable proxy.
  This method has been exploited by various malware and adversaries to establish proxy communication on compromised hosts, 
  facilitating connections to malicious Command and Control (C2) servers.
  Identifying this anomaly serves as a crucial indicator to unveil suspicious processes attempting to activate the proxy 
  feature within the Windows operating system. Detecting such attempts becomes pivotal in flagging potential threats, especially 
  those aiming to leverage proxy configurations for unauthorized communication with malicious entities.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
