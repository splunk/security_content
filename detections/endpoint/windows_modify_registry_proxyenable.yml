description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  key "ProxyEnable" to enable proxy settings. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
  datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to the "Internet Settings\ProxyEnable"
  registry path. This activity is significant as it is commonly exploited by malware
  and adversaries to establish proxy communication, potentially connecting to malicious
  Command and Control (C2) servers. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to redirect network traffic through a proxy, facilitating unauthorized communication
  and data exfiltration, thereby compromising the security of the affected host.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path = "*\\Internet
  Settings\\ProxyEnable"  Registry.registry_value_data = 0x00000001 by  Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid
  Registry.action Registry.user Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_proxyenable_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
