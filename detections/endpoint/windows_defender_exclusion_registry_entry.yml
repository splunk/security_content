description: This analytic will detect a suspicious process that modify a registry
  related to windows defender exclusion feature. This registry is abused by adversaries,
  malware author and red teams to bypassed Windows Defender Anti-Virus product by
  excluding folder path, file path, process, extensions and etc. from its real time
  or schedule scan to execute their malicious code. This is a good indicator for a
  defense evasion and to look further for events after this behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path = "*\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows
  Defender\\Exclusions\\*" by Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name
  Registry.registry_value_data | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `windows_defender_exclusion_registry_entry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: admin or user may choose to use this windows features.
