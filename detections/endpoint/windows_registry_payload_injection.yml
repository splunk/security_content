description: The following analytic detects suspiciously long data written to the
  Windows registry, a behavior often linked to fileless malware or persistence techniques.
  It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on registry
  events with data lengths exceeding 512 characters. This activity is significant
  as it can indicate an attempt to evade traditional file-based defenses, making it
  crucial for SOC monitoring. If confirmed malicious, this technique could allow attackers
  to maintain persistence, execute code, or manipulate system configurations without
  leaving a conventional file footprint.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Unknown, possible custom scripting.
