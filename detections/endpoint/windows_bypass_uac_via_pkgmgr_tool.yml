description: The following analytic identifies a potentially suspicious execution
  of the 'pkgmgr' process involving the use of an XML input file for package management.
  The 'pkgmgr' process, though deprecated in modern Windows systems, was historically
  used for managing packages. The presence of an XML input file raises concerns about
  the nature of the executed command and its potential impact on the system. Due to
  the deprecated status of 'pkgmgr' and the involvement of an XML file, this activity
  warrants careful investigation. XML files are commonly used for configuration and
  data exchange, making it crucial to ascertain the intentions and legitimacy of the
  command. To ensure system security, it is recommended to use up-to-date package
  management utilities, such as DISM or PowerShell's PackageManagement module, and
  exercise caution when executing commands involving potentially sensitive operations
  or files.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process_name = pkgmgr.exe
  Processes.process = "*.xml*" NOT(Processes.parent_process_path IN("*:\\windows\\system32\\*",
  "*:\\windows\\syswow64\\*", "*:\\Program Files*")) by Processes.dest Processes.user

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present on recent Windows Operating
  Systems. Filtering may be required based on process_name. In addition, look for
  non-standard, unsigned, module loads into LSASS. If query is too noisy, modify by
  adding Endpoint.processes process_name to query to identify the process making the
  modification.
