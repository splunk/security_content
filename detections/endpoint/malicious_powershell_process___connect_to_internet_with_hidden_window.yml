datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search looks for PowerShell processes started with parameters to
  modify the execution policy of the run, run in a hidden window, and connect to the
  Internet. This combination of command-line options is suspicious because it's overriding
  the default PowerShell execution policy, attempts to hide its activity from the
  user, and connects to the Internet. Deprecated becaue hidden is not needed when
  download file with System.Net.WebClient.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell`
  Processes.process=*-WindowStyle* Processes.process=*hidden* Processes.process="*New-Object*"
  by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `malicious_powershell_process___connect_to_internet_with_hidden_window_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Legitimate process can have this combination of command-line
  options, but it's not common.
