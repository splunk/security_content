description: This analytic identifies commonly used command-line arguments used by
  `rclone.exe` to initiate a file transfer. Some arguments were negated as they are
  specific to the configuration used by adversaries. In particular, an adversary may
  list the files or directories of the remote file share using `ls` or `lsd`, which
  is not indicative of malicious behavior. During triage, at this stage of a ransomware
  event, exfiltration is about to occur or has already. Isolate the endpoint and continue
  investigating by review file modifications and parallel processes.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint_Processess` datamodel.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is restricted to
  the Rclone process name. Filter or tune the analytic as needed.
