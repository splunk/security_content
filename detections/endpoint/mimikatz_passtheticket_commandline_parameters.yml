description: The following analytic looks for the use of Mimikatz command line parameters
  leveraged to execute pass the ticket attacks. Red teams and adversaries alike may
  use the pass the ticket technique using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally
  within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Defenders should
  be aware that adversaries may customize the source code of Mimikatz and modify the
  command line parameters. This would effectively bypass this analytic.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process = "*sekurlsa::tickets
  /export*" OR Processes.process = "*kerberos::ptt*") by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `mimikatz_passtheticket_commandline_parameters_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although highly unlikely, legitimate applications may use the
  same command line parameters as Mimikatz.
