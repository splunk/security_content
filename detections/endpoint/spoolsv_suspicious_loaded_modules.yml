description: This search is to detect suspicious loading of dll in specific path relative
  to printnightmare exploitation. In this search we try to detect the loaded modules
  made by spoolsv.exe after the exploitation.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 Image ="*\\spoolsv.exe" ImageLoaded="*\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\x64\\*"
  ImageLoaded = "*.dll" | stats dc(ImageLoaded) as countImgloaded values(ImageLoaded)
  as ImgLoaded count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image Computer process_id EventCode | where countImgloaded >= 3 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `spoolsv_suspicious_loaded_modules_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
