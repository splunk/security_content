type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects the suspicious loading of DLLs by spoolsv.exe,
  potentially indicating PrintNightmare exploitation. It leverages Sysmon EventCode
  7 to identify instances where spoolsv.exe loads multiple DLLs from the Windows System32
  spool drivers x64 directory. This activity is significant as it may signify an attacker
  exploiting the PrintNightmare vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation,
  and persistent access within the environment, posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 Image ="*\\spoolsv.exe" ImageLoaded="*\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\x64\\*"
  ImageLoaded = "*.dll" | stats dc(ImageLoaded) as countImgloaded values(ImageLoaded)
  as ImageLoaded count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image Computer
  ProcessId EventCode | rename Computer as dest | where countImgloaded >= 3 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `spoolsv_suspicious_loaded_modules_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
