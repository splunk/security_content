description: This analytic detects a potential suspicious modification of firewall
  rule allowing to execute specific application. This technique was identified when
  an adversary and red teams to bypassed firewall file execution restriction in a
  targetted host. Take note that this event or command can run by administrator during
  testing or allowing legitimate tool or application.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*firewall*"
  Processes.process = "*allowedprogram*" Processes.process = "*add*" Processes.process
  = "*ENABLE*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process

  | `firewall_allowed_program_enable_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may utilize an
  automated or manual execution of this firewall rule that may generate false positives.
  Filter as needed.
