description: The following analytic detects suspicious Kerberos Service Ticket (TGS)
  requests where the requesting account name matches the service name, potentially
  indicating an exploitation attempt of CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287. This detection
  leverages Event ID 4769 from Domain Controller and Kerberos events. Such activity
  is significant as it may represent an adversary attempting to escalate privileges
  by impersonating a domain controller. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an
  attacker to take control of the domain controller, leading to complete domain compromise
  and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4769
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4769 | eval isSuspicious = if(lower(ServiceName)
  = lower(mvindex(split(TargetUserName,"@"),0)),1,0) | where isSuspicious = 1 | rename
  Computer as dest| rename TargetUserName as user | table _time, dest, src_ip, user,
  ServiceName, Error_Code, isSuspicious | `suspicious_kerberos_service_ticket_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: We have tested this detection logic with ~2 million 4769 events
  and did not identify false positives. However, they may be possible in certain environments.
  Filter as needed.
