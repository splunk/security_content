description: As part of the sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller
  Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287) exploitation chain, adversaries will request and
  obtain a Kerberos Service Ticket (TGS) with a domain controller computer account
  as the Service Name. This Service Ticket can be then used to take control of the
  domain controller on the final part of the attack. This analytic leverages Event
  Id 4769, `A Kerberos service ticket was requested`, to identify an unusual TGS request
  where the Account_Name requesting the ticket matches the Service_Name field. This
  behavior could represent an exploitation attempt of CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287
  for privilege escalation.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4769 | eval isSuspicious = if(lower(Service_Name)
  = lower(mvindex(split(Account_Name,"@"),0)+"$"),1,0) | where isSuspicious = 1 |
  table _time, Client_Address, Account_Name, Service_Name, Failure_Code, isSuspicious
  | `suspicious_kerberos_service_ticket_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: We have tested this detection logic with ~2 million 4769 events
  and did not identify false positives. However, they may be possible in certain environments.
  Filter as needed.
