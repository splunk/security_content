description: The following analytic identifies DCRat "forkbomb" payload feature. 
  This technique was seen in dark crystal RAT backdoor capabilities where it will execute several cmd child process 
  executing "notepad.exe & pause". This analytic detects the multiple cmd.exe and child process notepad.exe  execution using batch script 
  in the targeted host within 30s timeframe. this TTP can be a good pivot to check DCRat infection.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
