description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a .crmlog file within
  the %windows%\Registration directory, typically with a format of <RANDOM_GUID>.<RANDOM_GUID>.crmlog.
  This detection leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem datamodel to monitor file creation
  events in the specified directory. This activity is significant as it is associated
  with the Snake malware, which uses this file for its operations. If confirmed malicious,
  this could indicate the presence of Snake malware, leading to potential data exfiltration,
  system compromise, and further malicious activities. Immediate investigation is
  required to mitigate the threat.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path="*\\windows\\registration\\*"
  AND  Filesystem.file_name="*.crmlog"  by Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.process_id  Filesystem.file_name
  Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `windows_snake_malware_file_modification_crmlog_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present as the file pattern does match
  legitimate files on disk. It is possible other native tools write the same file
  name scheme.
