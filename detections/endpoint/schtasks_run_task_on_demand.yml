description: The following analytic detects the execution of a Windows Scheduled Task
  on demand via the shell or command line. It leverages process-related data, including
  process name, parent process, and command-line executions, sourced from endpoint
  logs. The detection focuses on 'schtasks.exe' with an associated 'run' command.
  This activity is significant as adversaries often use it to force the execution
  of their created Scheduled Tasks for persistent access or lateral movement within
  a compromised machine. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain
  persistence or move laterally within the network, potentially leading to further
  compromise.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "schtasks.exe"
  Processes.process = "*/run*" by Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `schtasks_run_task_on_demand_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Bear in mind, administrators debugging Scheduled Task entries
  may trigger this analytic, necessitating fine-tuning and filtering to distinguish
  between legitimate and potentially malicious use of 'schtasks.exe'.
