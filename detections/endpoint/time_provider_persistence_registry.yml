description: This analytic is to detect a suspiciouos modification of time provider
  registry for persistence and autostart. This technique can allow the attacker to
  persist on the compromised host and autostart as soon as the machine boot up. This
  TTP can be a good indicator of suspicious behavior since this registry is not commonly
  modified by normal user or even an admin.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path
  ="*\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\W32Time\\TimeProviders*" by Registry.dest  Registry.user
  Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)`
  | `time_provider_persistence_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
