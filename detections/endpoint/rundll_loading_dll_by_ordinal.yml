description: This search looks for executing scripts with rundll32. Adversaries may
  abuse rundll32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Using rundll32.exe, vice
  executing directly, may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution
  of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from normal
  operations.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.

known_false_positives: While not common, loading a DLL under %AppData% and calling
  a function by ordinal is possible by a legitimate process
