description: The following analytic identifies rundll32.exe loading an export function
  by ordinal value. Adversaries may abuse rundll32.exe to proxy execution of malicious
  code. Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly, may avoid triggering security
  tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists
  or false positives from normal operations. Utilizing ordinal values makes it a bit
  more complicated for analysts to understand the behavior until the DLL is reviewed.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_rundll32` by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | where match(process,"rundll32.+\#\d+") |
  `rundll_loading_dll_by_ordinal_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible with native utilities and third
  party applications. Filtering may be needed based on command-line, or add world
  writeable paths to restrict query.
