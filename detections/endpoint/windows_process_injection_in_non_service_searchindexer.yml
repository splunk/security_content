description: The following analytic identifies a non-service searchindexer.exe process. 
  QakBot, a notorious banking trojan and information stealer, often deploys a process named "searchindexer.exe" 
  as part of its malicious activities. This legitimate Windows process, "Search Indexer," is manipulated by 
  QakBot to masquerade and evade detection within the system. The malware uses this deceptive tactic to 
  camouflage its presence, remaining inconspicuous while performing unauthorized actions like data exfiltration, 
  keystroke logging, and communication with command and control servers. By adopting the guise of a genuine system process, 
  the malicious "searchindexer.exe" process helps QakBot evade scrutiny and continue its malevolent operations without arousing suspicion.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
