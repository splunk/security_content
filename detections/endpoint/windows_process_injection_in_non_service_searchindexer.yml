description: The following analytic identifies instances of the searchindexer.exe
  process that are not spawned by services.exe, indicating potential process injection.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and parent processes. This activity is significant because
  QakBot malware often uses a fake searchindexer.exe to evade detection and perform
  malicious actions such as data exfiltration and keystroke logging. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow attackers to maintain persistence, steal sensitive
  information, and communicate with command and control servers.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  != services.exe Processes.process_name=searchindexer.exe by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_process_injection_in_non_service_searchindexer_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
