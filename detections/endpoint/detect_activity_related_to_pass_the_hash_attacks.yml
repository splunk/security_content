description: This search looks for specific authentication events from the Windows
  Security Event logs to detect potential attempts at using the Pass-the-Hash technique.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4624 (Logon_Type=3 Logon_Process=NtLmSsp
  WorkstationName=WORKSTATION NOT AccountName="ANONYMOUS LOGON") OR (Logon_Type=9
  Logon_Process=seclogo) | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by EventCode, Logon_Type, WorkstationName, user, dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_activity_related_to_pass_the_hash_attacks_filter` '
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest your Windows
  Security Event logs and leverage the latest TA for Windows.
known_false_positives: Legitimate logon activity by authorized NTLM systems may be
  detected by this search. Please investigate as appropriate.
