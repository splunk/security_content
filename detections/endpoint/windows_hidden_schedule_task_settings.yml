description: The following analytic detects the creation of hidden scheduled tasks on Windows systems, which are not visible in the UI. It leverages Windows Security EventCode 4698 to identify tasks where the 'Hidden' setting is enabled. This behavior is significant as it may indicate malware activity, such as Industroyer2, or the use of living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBINs) to download additional payloads. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute code stealthily, maintain persistence, or further compromise the system by downloading additional malicious payloads.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4698
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698 | xmlkv Message | search Hidden = true | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by  Task_Name, Command, Author, Hidden, dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_hidden_schedule_task_settings_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the task schedule (Exa. Security Log EventCode 4698) endpoints. Tune and filter known instances of Task schedule used in your environment.
