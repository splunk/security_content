description: The following analytic detects the creation of hidden scheduled tasks
  on Windows systems, which are not visible in the UI. It leverages Windows Security
  EventCode 4698 to identify tasks where the 'Hidden' setting is enabled. This behavior
  is significant as it may indicate malware activity, such as Industroyer2, or the
  use of living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBINs) to download additional payloads. If
  confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute code stealthily,
  maintain persistence, or further compromise the system by downloading additional
  malicious payloads.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4698
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698 | xmlkv Message | search Hidden = true
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by  Task_Name, Command,
  Author, Hidden, dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_hidden_schedule_task_settings_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the task schedule (Exa. Security Log EventCode 4698) endpoints. Tune and
  filter known instances of Task schedule used in your environment.
