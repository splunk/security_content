description: The following analytic identifies gpupdate.exe with no command line arguments
  and with a network connection. It is unusual for gpupdate.exe to execute with no
  command line arguments present. This particular behavior is common with malicious
  software, including Cobalt Strike. During investigation, triage any network connections
  and parallel processes. Identify any suspicious module loads related to credential
  dumping or file writes. gpupdate.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and
  C:\Windows\syswow64.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present in small environments.
  Tuning may be required based on parent process.

  message: Process gpupdate.exe  with parent_process $parent_process_name$ is executed
    on $dest$ by user $user$, followed by an outbound network connection to $C2$
    on port $dest_port$. This behaviour is seen with cobaltstrike.
