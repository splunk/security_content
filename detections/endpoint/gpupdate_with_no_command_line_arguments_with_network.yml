datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies gpupdate.exe with no command line arguments
  and with a network connection. It is unusual for gpupdate.exe to execute with no
  command line arguments present. This particular behavior is common with malicious
  software, including Cobalt Strike. During investigation, triage any network connections
  and parallel processes. Identify any suspicious module loads related to credential
  dumping or file writes. gpupdate.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and
  C:\Windows\syswow64.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=gpupdate.exe by _time span=1h  Processes.process_guid
  Processes.process_name Processes.dest Processes.process_path Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | regex process="(gpupdate\.exe.{0,4}$)" | join  process_guid [| tstats `security_content_summariesonly`
  count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Ports where Ports.dest_port !="0" by Ports.process_guid
  Ports.dest Ports.dest_port| `drop_dm_object_name(Ports)` | rename  dest as connection_to_CNC]
  | table _time dest parent_process_name process_name process_path process process_guid
  connection_to_CNC dest_port | `gpupdate_with_no_command_line_arguments_with_network_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present in small environments.
  Tuning may be required based on parent process.

  message: Process gpupdate.exe  with parent_process $parent_process_name$ is executed
    on $dest$ by user $user$, followed by an outbound network connection to $connection_to_CNC$
    on port $dest_port$. This behaviour is seen with cobaltstrike.
