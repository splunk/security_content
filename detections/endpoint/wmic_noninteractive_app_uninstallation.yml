description: This analytic indentifies WMIC command-line attempting to uninstall application
  non-interactively. This technique was seen in IcedID to uninstall AV products on
  the compromised host to evade detection. This Hunting query maybe a good indicator
  that some process tries to uninstall application using wmic which is not a common
  behavior. This approach may seen in some script or third part appication to uninstall
  their application but it is a good thing to check what it uninstall and why.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=wmic.exe
  Processes.process="* product *" Processes.process="*where name*" Processes.process="*call
  uninstall*" Processes.process="*/nointeractive*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wmic_noninteractive_app_uninstallation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Third party application may use this approach to uninstall
  applications.
