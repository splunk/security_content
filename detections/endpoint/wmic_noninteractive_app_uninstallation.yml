description: The following analytic identifies the use of the WMIC command-line tool
  attempting to uninstall applications non-interactively. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line patterns
  associated with WMIC. This activity is significant because it is uncommon and may
  indicate an attempt to evade detection by uninstalling security software, as seen
  in IcedID malware campaigns. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an
  attacker to disable security defenses, facilitating further compromise and persistence
  within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=wmic.exe
  Processes.process="* product *" Processes.process="*where name*" Processes.process="*call
  uninstall*" Processes.process="*/nointeractive*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.original_file_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wmic_noninteractive_app_uninstallation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Third party application may use this approach to uninstall
  applications.
