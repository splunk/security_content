description: This analytic detects modifications to privileged groups in Active Directory, including creation, deletion, and changes to various types of groups such as local, global, universal, and LDAP query groups. It specifically monitors for changes to high-privilege groups like "Administrators", "Domain Admins", "Enterprise Admins", and "ESX Admins", among others. This detection is particularly relevant in the context of potential exploitation of vulnerabilities like the VMware ESXi Active Directory Integration Authentication Bypass (CVE-2024-37085), where attackers may attempt to manipulate privileged groups to gain unauthorized access to systems.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, ensure that Windows Security Event logging is enabled and being ingested into Splunk, particularly for event codes 4727, 4730, and 4737. Configure Group Policy settings to audit these specific events.
known_false_positives: Legitimate administrators might create, delete, or modify an a privileged group for valid reasons. Verify that the group changes are authorized and part of normal administrative tasks. Consider the context of the action, such as the user performing it and any related activities.
