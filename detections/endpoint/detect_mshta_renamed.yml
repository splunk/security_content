description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of mshta.exe executing.
  Mshta.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. This
  analytic utilizes the internal name of the PE to identify if is the legitimate mshta
  binary. Further analysis should be performed to review the executed content and
  validation it is the real mshta.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of mshta.exe, but never renamed, triggering a false positive.
