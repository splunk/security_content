description: The following analytic identifies instances where mshta.exe has been
  renamed and executed. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, specifically
  focusing on the original file name field to detect discrepancies. This activity
  is significant because renaming mshta.exe is a common tactic used by attackers to
  evade detection and execute malicious scripts. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise,
  data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name!=mshta.exe
  AND Processes.original_file_name=MSHTA.EXE by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.original_file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_mshta_renamed_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of mshta.exe, but never renamed, triggering a false positive.
