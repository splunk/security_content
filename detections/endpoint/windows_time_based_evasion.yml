description: This analytic is designed to detect potentially malicious processes that initiate a ping delay using an invalid IP address. 
  This evasion technique was observed in NJRAT, where the malware employed ping commands as a means to introduce a time delay before self-deletion on the compromised host. 
  Identifying this (TTP) behavior can serve as a valuable indicator for detecting NJRAT infections or other malware that employ time delays as 
  evasion tactics.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
