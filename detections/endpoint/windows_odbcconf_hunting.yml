description: The following analytic identifies the execution of Odbcconf.exe within
  the environment. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process creation events where the process name is Odbcconf.exe. This
  activity is significant because Odbcconf.exe can be used by attackers to execute
  arbitrary commands or load malicious DLLs, potentially leading to code execution
  or persistence. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to
  maintain access to the system, execute further malicious activities, or escalate
  privileges, posing a significant threat to the environment.

- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=odbcconf.exe
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_odbcconf_hunting_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present as this is meant to assist
  with filtering and tuning.
