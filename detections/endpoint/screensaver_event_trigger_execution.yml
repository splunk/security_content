description: The following analytic detects modifications to the SCRNSAVE.EXE registry
  entry, indicating potential event trigger execution via screensaver settings for
  persistence or privilege escalation. It leverages registry activity data from the
  Endpoint data model to identify changes to the specified registry path. This activity
  is significant as it is a known technique used by APT groups and malware to maintain
  persistence or escalate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an
  attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, leading to further
  system compromise and persistent access.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 12 
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where (Registry.registry_path="*\\Control
  Panel\\Desktop\\SCRNSAVE.EXE*") by Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `screensaver_event_trigger_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
