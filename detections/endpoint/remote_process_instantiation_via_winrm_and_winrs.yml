name: Remote Process Instantiation via WinRM and Winrs

type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `winrs.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to start a process on a remote endpoint. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may abuse the WinRM protocol and this binary for lateral movement and remote
  code execution.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=winrs.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=winrs.exe) (Processes.process="*-r:*" OR Processes.process="*-remote:*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_process_instantiation_via_winrm_and_winrs_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WinRM and WinRs to start a process
  on remote systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts
  or users.
