description: The following analytic detects the execution of `winrs.exe` with command-line
  arguments used to start a process on a remote endpoint. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code execution attempts
  by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code on remote systems, potentially leading to further compromise and lateral spread
  within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=winrs.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=winrs.exe) (Processes.process="*-r:*" OR Processes.process="*-remote:*")

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WinRM and WinRs to start a process
  on remote systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts
  or users.
