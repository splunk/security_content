description: This analytic will detect if a suspicious process contains a commandline
  parameter related to a web browser credential dumper. This technique is used by
  Remcos RAT malware which uses the Nirsoft webbrowserpassview.exe application to
  dump web browser credentials. Remcos uses the "/stext" command line to dump the
  credentials in text format. This Hunting query is a good indicator of hosts suffering
  from possible Remcos RAT infection. Since the hunting query is based on the parameter
  command and the possible path where it will save the text credential information,
  it may catch normal tools that are using the same command and behavior.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positive is quite limited. Filter is needed
