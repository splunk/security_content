description: The following analytic identifies processes with command-line parameters
  associated with web browser credential dumping tools, specifically targeting behaviors
  used by Remcos RAT malware. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and specific file paths. This
  activity is significant as it indicates potential credential theft, a common tactic
  in broader cyber-espionage campaigns. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain
  unauthorized access to sensitive web credentials, leading to further system compromise
  and data breaches.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positive is quite limited. Filter is needed
