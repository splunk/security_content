description: This analytic will detect a suspicious process contains a commandline
  parameter related to web browser credential dumper. This technique was used by Remcos
  RAT malware where it use the techique of Nirsoft webbrowserpassview.exe application
  to dump web browser credentials. Remcos use the "/stext" commandline to dump the
  credential in text format. This Hunting query is good indicator to look further
  for possible remcos infection within the network or possible compromised host. Since
  the detections is only base on the parameter command and the possible path where
  it will drop the text credential information, It may catch normal tools that having
  same command and behavior.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positive is quite limited. Filter is needed
