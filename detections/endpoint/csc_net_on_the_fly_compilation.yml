description: The following analytic detects the use of the .NET compiler csc.exe for
  on-the-fly compilation of potentially malicious .NET code. It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line
  patterns associated with csc.exe. This activity is significant because adversaries
  and malware often use this technique to evade detection by compiling malicious code
  at runtime. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral
  movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_csc` Processes.process
  = "*/noconfig*" Processes.process = "*/fullpaths*" Processes.process = "*@*" by
  Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id

  | `csc_net_on_the_fly_compilation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may utilize an
  automated powershell script taht execute .net code that may generate false positive.
  filter is needed.
