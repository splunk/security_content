description: The following analytic leverages Event 4768, A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested, to identify a TGT request with encryption type 0x17, or 
  RC4-HMAC. This encryption type is no longer utilized by newer systems and could represent evidence of an OverPass The Hash attack. Similar to Pass The Hash, OverPass The Hash
  is a form of credential theft that allows adversaries to move laterally or consume resources in a target network. Leveraging this attack, an adversary who has stolen the NTLM
  hash of a valid domain account is able to authenticate to the Kerberos Distribution Center(KDC) on behalf of the legitimate account and obtain a Kerberos TGT ticket. Depending on the 
  privileges of the compromised account, this ticket may be used to obtain unauthorized access to systems and other network resources.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Based on Microsoft documentation, legacy systems or applications will use RC4-HMAC as the default encryption for TGT requests. Specifically, 
  systems before Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. Newer systems will use AES128 or AES256.
