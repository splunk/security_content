description: The following analytic detects the execution of mshta.exe via registry
  entries to run malicious scripts. It leverages registry activity logs to identify
  entries containing "mshta," "javascript," "vbscript," or "WScript.Shell." This behavior
  is significant as it indicates potential fileless malware, such as Kovter, which
  uses encoded scripts in the registry to persist and execute without files. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow attackers to maintain persistence, execute
  arbitrary code, and evade traditional file-based detection methods, posing a significant
  threat to system integrity and security.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_value_data
  = "*mshta*" OR Registry.registry_value_data IN ("*javascript:*", "*vbscript:*","*WScript.Shell*")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
