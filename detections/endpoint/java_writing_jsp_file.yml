description: The following analytic identifies the process java writing a .jsp to disk. This is potentially indicative of a web shell being written to disk. 
  Modify and tune the analytic based on data ingested. For instance, it may be worth running a broad query for jsp file writes first before performing a join.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN ("java","java.exe", "javaw.exe")
  by _time Processes.process_id Processes.process_name Processes.dest Processes.process_guid
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | join process_guid [| tstats
  `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where
  Filesystem.file_name="*.jsp*" by _time Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time
  Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | fields _time process_guid file_path file_name
  file_create_time user dest process_name] | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by dest process_name process_guid file_name file_path file_create_time
  user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `java_writing_jsp_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible and filtering may be required. Restrict by assets or filter known jsp files that are common for the environment.
