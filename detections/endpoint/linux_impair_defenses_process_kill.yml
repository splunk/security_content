description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the 'pkill' command,
  which is used to terminate processes on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions. This activity is significant because threat actors often use 'pkill'
  to disable security defenses or terminate critical processes, facilitating further
  malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to the disruption
  of security applications, enabling attackers to evade detection and potentially
  corrupt or destroy files on the targeted system.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN (
  "pgrep", "pkill") Processes.process = "*pkill *" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_impair_defenses_process_kill_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network admin can terminate a process using this linux command.
  Filter is needed.
