description: This analytic looks for PKILL process execution for possible termination
  of process. This technique is being used by several Threat actors, adversaries and
  red teamers to terminate processes in a targeted linux machine. This Hunting detection
  can be a good pivot to check a possible defense evasion technique or termination
  of security application in a linux host or wiper like Awfulshred that corrupt all
  files.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN (
  "pgrep", "pkill") Processes.process = "*pkill *" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_impair_defenses_process_kill_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network admin can terminate a process using this linux command.
  Filter is needed.
