description: This analytic looks for PKILL process execution for possible termination of process. 
  This technique is being used by several Threat actors, adversaries and red teamers to terminate processes in a targeted linux machine. 
  This Hunting detection can be a good pivot to check a possible defense evasion technique or termination of security application in a linux host or 
  wiper like Awfulshred that corrupt all files.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name IN ( "pgrep", "pkill") Processes.process = "*pkill *"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id 
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `linux_impair_defenses_process_kill_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: network admin can terminate a process using this linux command. Filter is needed.
