description: This analytic looks for PKILL process execution for possible termination
  of process. This technique is being used by several Threat actors, adversaries and
  red teamers to terminate processes in a targeted linux machine. This Hunting detection
  can be a good pivot to check a possible defense evasion technique or termination
  of security application in a linux host or wiper like Awfulshred that corrupt all
  files.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN (
  "pgrep", "pkill") Processes.process = "*pkill *" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_impair_defenses_process_kill_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: network admin can terminate a process using this linux command.
  Filter is needed.
