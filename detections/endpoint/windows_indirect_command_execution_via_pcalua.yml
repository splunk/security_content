description: The following analytic detects programs that have been started by pcalua.exe.
  pcalua.exe is the Microsoft Windows Program Compatability Assistant.  While this
  tool can be used to start legitimate programs, it has been observed being used to
  evade protections on command line execution.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process="*pcalua*
  -a*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_indirect_command_execution_via_pcalua_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the full process path in the process field of CIM's Process data model.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Tune and filter known instances where pcalua.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Some legacy applications may be run using pcalua.exe.  Filter
  these results as needed.
