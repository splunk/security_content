description: This search detects the suspicious commandline argument of revil ransomware
  to encrypt specific or all local drive and network shares of the compromised machine
  or host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*-m local*"
  OR Processes.process = "*-m net*" OR Processes.process = "*-m all*" OR Processes.process
  = "*-nomutex*" by Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `conti_common_exec_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: 3rd party tool may have commandline parameter that can trigger
  this detection.
