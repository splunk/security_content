description: The following analytic identifies command-line activity that searches
  for files related to password manager software, such as "*.kdbx*" and "*credential*".
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process execution logs. This activity is significant because attackers often target
  password manager databases to extract stored credentials, which can be used for
  further exploitation. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized
  access to sensitive information, enabling attackers to escalate privileges, move
  laterally, or exfiltrate critical data.

  OR  Processes.process = "*findstr*" AND Processes.process IN ( "*.kdbx*", "*credential*",

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
