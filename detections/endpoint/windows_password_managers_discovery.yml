description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves
  information related to password manager software. This technique was seen in several
  post exploitation tools like winpeas that are being used by Ransomware Prestige
  to gather this type of information. Password Managers applications are designed
  to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically
  accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After
  the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases
  can be stored as files on disk. Due to this password manager software designed adversaries
  may find or look for keywords related to the Password Manager databases that can
  be stolen or extracted for further attacks.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
