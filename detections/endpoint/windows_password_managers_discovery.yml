description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves information related to password manager software. 
  This technique was seen in several post exploitation tools like winpeas that are being used by Ransomware Prestige to gather this type of information. 
  Password Managers applications are designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a 
  user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. 
  These databases can be stored as files on disk. Due to this password manager software designed adversaries may find or look for keywords related to the Password 
  Manager databases that can be stolen or extracted for further attacks.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process = "*dir *" OR  Processes.process = "*findstr*"
  AND Processes.process IN ( "*.kdbx*", "*credential*", "*key3.db*","*pass*", "*cred*", "*key4.db*", "*accessTokens*", "*access_tokens*", "*.htpasswd*", "*Ntds.dit*")

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_password_managers_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
