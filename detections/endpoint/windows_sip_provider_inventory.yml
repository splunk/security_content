description: The following analytic identifies all SIP (Subject Interface Package)
  providers on a Windows system using PowerShell scripted inputs. It detects SIP providers
  by capturing DLL paths from relevant events. This activity is significant because
  malicious SIP providers can be used to bypass trust controls, potentially allowing
  unauthorized code execution. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable
  attackers to subvert system integrity, leading to unauthorized access or persistent
  threats within the environment. Analysts should review for new and non-standard
  paths to identify potential threats.
search: '`subjectinterfacepackage` Dll=*\\*.dll | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(Dll) by Path host| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `windows_sip_provider_inventory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, one must first perform inventory using
  a scripted inputs. Review the following Gist - https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/75dd5db546c143ea67703d0e86cdbbd1
known_false_positives: False positives are limited as this is a hunting query for
  inventory.
