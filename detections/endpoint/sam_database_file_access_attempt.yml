description: The following analytic identifies access to SAM, SYSTEM or SECURITY databases'
  within the file path of `windows\system32\config` using Windows Security EventCode
  4663. This particular behavior is related to credential access, an attempt to either
  use a Shadow Copy or recent CVE-2021-36934 to access the SAM database. The Security
  Account Manager (SAM) is a database file in Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7,
  8.1 and 10 that stores users' passwords.
search: '`wineventlog_security` (EventCode=4663)  process_name!=*\\dllhost.exe Object_Name
  IN ("*\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SAM*","*\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SYSTEM*","*\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SECURITY*")
  | stats values(Accesses) count by process_name Object_Name  dest user | `sam_database_file_access_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Natively, `dllhost.exe` will access the files. Every environment
  will have additional native processes that do as well. Filter by process_name. As
  an aside, one can remove process_name entirely and add `Object_Name=*ShadowCopy*`.
