name: SAM Database File Access Attempt
id: 57551656-ebdb-11eb-afdf-acde48001122

author: Michael Haag, Mauricio Velazco, Splunk
status: production
type: Hunting
description: The following analytic detects attempts to access the SAM, SYSTEM, or
  SECURITY database files within the `windows\system32\config` directory using Windows
  Security EventCode 4663. This detection leverages Windows Security Event logs to
  identify unauthorized access attempts. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it
  indicates potential credential access attempts, possibly exploiting vulnerabilities
  like CVE-2021-36934. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could extract user passwords,
  leading to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and further compromise of
  the system.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4663
search: '`wineventlog_security` (EventCode=4663)  ProcessName!=*\\dllhost.exe ObjectName
  IN ("*\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SAM*","*\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SYSTEM*","*\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SECURITY*")
  | stats values(AccessList) count by ProcessName ObjectName dest src_user | rename
  ProcessName as process_name | `sam_database_file_access_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Natively, `dllhost.exe` will access the files. Every environment
  will have additional native processes that do as well. Filter by process_name. As
  an aside, one can remove process_name entirely and add `Object_Name=*ShadowCopy*`.
