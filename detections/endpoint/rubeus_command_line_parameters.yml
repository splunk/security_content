description: Rubeus is a C# toolset for raw Kerberos interaction and abuses. It is
  heavily adapted from Benjamin Delpys Kekeo project and Vincent LE TOUXs MakeMeEnterpriseAdmin
  project. This analytic looks for the use of Rubeus command line arguments utilized
  in common Kerberos attacks like exporting and importing tickets, forging silver
  and golden tickets, requesting a TGT or TGS, kerberoasting, password spraying, etc.
  Red teams and adversaries alike use Rubeus for Kerberos attacks within Active Directory
  networks. Defenders should be aware that adversaries may customize the source code
  of Rubeus and modify the command line parameters. This would effectively bypass
  this analytic.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, legitimate applications may use the same
  command line parameters as Rubeus. Filter as needed.
