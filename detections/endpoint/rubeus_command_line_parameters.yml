description: Rubeus is a C# toolset for raw Kerberos interaction and abuses. It is
  heavily adapted from Benjamin Delpys Kekeo project and Vincent LE TOUXs MakeMeEnterpriseAdmin
  project. This analytic looks for the use of Rubeus command line arguments utilized
  in common Kerberos attacks like exporting and importing tickets, forging silver
  and golden tickets, requesting a TGT or TGS, kerberoasting, password spraying, etc.
  Red teams and adversaries alike use Rubeus for Kerberos attacks within Active Directory
  networks. Defenders should be aware that adversaries may customize the source code
  of Rubeus and modify the command line parameters. This would effectively bypass
  this analytic.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process = "*ptt /ticket*"
  OR Processes.process = "* monitor /interval*" OR Processes.process ="* asktgt* /user:*" OR
  Processes.process ="* asktgs* /service:*" OR Processes.process ="* golden* /user:*"
  OR Processes.process ="* silver* /service:*" OR Processes.process ="* kerberoast*"
  OR Processes.process ="* asreproast*" OR Processes.process = "* renew* /ticket:*"
  OR Processes.process = "* brute* /password:*" OR Processes.process = "* brute* /passwords:*"
  OR Processes.process ="* harvest*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rubeus_command_line_parameters_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, legitimate applications may use the same
  command line parameters as Rubeus. Filter as needed.
