description: The following analytic detects the use of the base64 decode command on
  Linux systems, which is often used to deobfuscate files. It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
  that include "base64 -d" or "base64 --decode". This activity is significant as it
  may indicate an attempt to hide malicious payloads or scripts. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could use this technique to execute hidden code, potentially leading
  to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_path="*/base64" Processes.process="*-d*" by Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.process_current_directory Processes.process_name Processes.process_integrity_level Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process_path Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process_id Processes.user

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and will require some tuning
  based on processes. Filter as needed.
