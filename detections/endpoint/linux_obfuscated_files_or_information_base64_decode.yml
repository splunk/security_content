datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies the use of base64 decode on Linux being utilized to deobfuscate a file. Identify the source of the file and determine if legitimate. Review parallel processes for further behavior before and after.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN ("*base64 -d*","*base64 --decode*")
   by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_obfuscated_files_or_information_base64_decode_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and will require some tuning based on processes. Filter as needed.
