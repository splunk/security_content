description: The following analytic detects when a known remote access software is executed within the environment. Adversaries use these utilities to retain remote access capabilities to the environment. Utilities in the lookup include AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, TeamViewer and much more. Review the lookup for the entire list and add any others.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.dest!=unknown Processes.process!=unknown by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.process 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | lookup remote_access_software remote_utility AS process_name OUTPUT isutility, description as signature, comment_reference as desc, category

  | `detect_remote_access_software_usage_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible that legitimate remote access software is used
  within the environment. Ensure that the lookup is reviewed and updated with any
  additional remote access software that is used within the environment.
