description: The following analytic detects the execution of known remote access software
  within the environment. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names and parent processes mapped to the Endpoint data
  model. This activity is significant as adversaries often use remote access tools
  like AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, and TeamViewer to maintain unauthorized access.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to control systems remotely,
  exfiltrate data, or deploy additional malware, posing a severe threat to the organization's
  security.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process. The "exceptions" macro leverages 
  both an Assets and Identities lookup, as well as a KVStore collection called 
  "remote_software_exceptions" that lets you track and maintain device-
  based exceptions for this set of detections.
known_false_positives: It is possible that legitimate remote access software is used
  within the environment. Ensure that the lookup is reviewed and updated with any
  additional remote access software that is used within the environment. 
  Known false positives can be added to the remote_access_software_usage_exception 
  lookup to globally suppress these situations across all remote access content
