name: Credential Extraction native Microsoft debuggers via z command line option

description: Credential extraction is often an illegal recovery of credential material 
  from secured authentication resources and repositories. This process may also involve 
  decryption or other transformations of the stored credential material. 
  Native Microsoft debuggers, such as kd, ntkd, livekd and windbg, can be leveraged to read credential material directly from
  memory and process dumps.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Windows Security logs from devices of interest, including the event ID 4688 with enabled command line logging.

eli5: "This detects use of -z command line option which specifies location of the credentials dump file to native Microsoft debuggers."
known_false_positives:
  "Although unlikely, using debuggers this way may be indicative of developers analyzing crash dumps of their code. 
   Note, even for developers this is an unusual way of working on code - debuggers are mostly used to step through code, not analyze its crash dumps."
