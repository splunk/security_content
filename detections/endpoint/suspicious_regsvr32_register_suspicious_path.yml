description: Adversaries may abuse Regsvr32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code
  by using non-standard file extensions to load malciious DLLs. Upon investigating,
  look for network connections to remote destinations (internal or external). Review
  additional parrallel processes and child processes for additional activity.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` (Processes.process=*appdata*
  OR Processes.process=*programdata* OR Processes.process=*windows\temp*) (Processes.process!=*.dll
  Processes.process!=*.ax Processes.process!=*.ocx) by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_regsvr32_register_suspicious_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints, to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model. Tune the query by filtering additional extensions
  found to be used by  legitimate processes. To successfully implement this search
  you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process
  responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in
  the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is
  installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives with the query restricted to specified
  paths. Add more world writeable paths as tuning continues.
