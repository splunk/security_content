description: Adversaries may abuse Regsvr32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code
  by using non-standard file extensions to load DLLs. Upon investigating, look for
  network connections to remote destinations (internal or external). Review additional
  parrallel processes and child processes for additional activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives with the query restricted to specified
  paths. Add more world writeable paths as tuning continues.
