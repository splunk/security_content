description: The following analytics identifies a big number of instance of ransomware
  notes (filetype e.g .txt, .html, .hta) file creation to the infected machine. This
  behavior is a good sensor if the ransomware note filename is quite new for security
  industry or the ransomware note filename is not in your ransomware lookup table
  list for monitoring.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11 file_name IN ("*\.txt","*\.html","*\.hta") |bin _time
  span=10s | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime dc(TargetFilename)
  as unique_readme_path_count values(TargetFilename) as list_of_readme_path by Computer
  Image file_name | rename Computer as dest | where unique_readme_path_count >= 15 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ransomware_notes_bulk_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data model node. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
