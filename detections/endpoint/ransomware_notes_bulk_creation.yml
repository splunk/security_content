description: The following analytic identifies the bulk creation of ransomware notes
  (e.g., .txt, .html, .hta files) on an infected machine. It leverages Sysmon EventCode
  11 to detect multiple instances of these file types being created within a short
  time frame. This activity is significant as it often indicates an active ransomware
  attack, where the attacker is notifying the victim of the encryption. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to widespread data encryption, rendering critical
  files inaccessible and potentially causing significant operational disruption.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11 file_name IN ("*\.txt","*\.html","*\.hta") |bin _time
  span=10s | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime dc(TargetFilename)
  as unique_readme_path_count values(TargetFilename) as list_of_readme_path by Computer
  Image file_name | rename Computer as dest | where unique_readme_path_count >= 15
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ransomware_notes_bulk_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data model node. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
