name: Disabling Firewall with Netsh

description: The following analytic identifies the disabling of the firewall using the netsh application. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include keywords like "firewall," "off," or "disable." This activity is significant because disabling the firewall can expose the system to external threats, allowing malware to communicate with its command and control (C2) server. If confirmed malicious, this action could lead to unauthorized data exfiltration, further malware downloads, and broader network compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: admin may disable firewall during testing or fixing network problem.
