description: The following analytic detects any system integrity level process that was spawned by a process not running as a system account. This behavior is often seen when attackers successfully escalate privileges to SYSTEM from a user controlled process or service.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: >-
  `sysmon` EventCode=1 IntegrityLevel="system" ParentUser=* NOT ParentUser IN ("*SYSTEM","*LOCAL SERVICE","*NETWORK SERVICE","*DWM-*","*$","-") | eval src_user = replace(ParentUser,"^[^\\\]+\\\\","") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(process_name) as process_name values(process) as process, values(process_path) as process_path, values(process_current_directory) as process_current_directory values(parent_process) as parent_process by dest, user, src_user,
  parent_process_name, parent_process_guid | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_privilege_escalation_system_process_without_system_parent_filter`
how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest sysmon data, specifically Event ID 1 with process integrity and parent user data.
