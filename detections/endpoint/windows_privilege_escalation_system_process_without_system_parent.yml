description: The following analytic detects any system integrity level process spawned
  by a non-system account. It leverages Sysmon EventID 1, focusing on process integrity
  and parent user data. This behavior is significant as it often indicates successful
  privilege escalation to SYSTEM from a user-controlled process or service. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to gain full control over the system,
  execute arbitrary code, and potentially compromise the entire environment.

- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2

  `sysmon` EventCode=1 IntegrityLevel="system" ParentUser=* NOT ParentUser IN ("*SYSTEM","*LOCAL
  SERVICE","*NETWORK SERVICE","*DWM-*","*$","-") | eval src_user = replace(ParentUser,"^[^\\\]+\\\\","")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(process_name)
  as process_name values(process) as process, values(process_path) as process_path,
  values(process_current_directory) as process_current_directory values(parent_process)

  parent_process_name, parent_process_guid | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`  |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_privilege_escalation_system_process_without_system_parent_filter`
how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest sysmon data, specifically Event ID
  1 with process integrity and parent user data.
