description: This detection identifies unsigned DLLs loaded through DLL side-loading with same file path with the process loaded the DLL, a technique observed in DarkGate malware. 
  This detection monitors DLL loading, verifies signatures, and flags unsigned DLLs. Suspicious file paths and known executable 
  associations are checked. Detecting such suspicious DLLs is crucial in preventing privilege escalation attacks and other potential security breaches. Regular security assessments, thorough monitoring, 
  and implementing security best practices are essential in safeguarding systems from such threats.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. 
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
