description: The following analytic detects the use of the PowerShell cmdlet `export-pfxcertificate`
  by leveraging Script Block Logging. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  an adversary attempting to exfiltrate certificates from the Windows Certificate
  Store. Monitoring this behavior is crucial for identifying potential certificate
  theft, which can lead to unauthorized access and impersonation attacks. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow attackers to compromise secure communications,
  authenticate as legitimate users, and escalate their privileges within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN ("*export-pfxcertificate*")
  | rename Computer as dest  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by EventCode ScriptBlockText dest user_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_powershell_export_pfxcertificate_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: It is possible administrators or scripts may run these commands,
  filtering may be required.
