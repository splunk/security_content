description: PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.
  It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
  The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. If sudo right
  is given to php application for the user, then the user can run system commands
  as root and possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*php*-r*"
  AND Processes.process="*system*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_php_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
