description: The following analytic detects Microsoft Remote Assistance (msra.exe)
  spawning PowerShell.exe or cmd.exe as a child process. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation
  events where msra.exe is the parent process. This activity is significant because
  msra.exe typically does not spawn command-line interfaces, indicating potential
  process injection or misuse. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use this
  technique to execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence
  on the compromised system.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=msra.exe
  `windows_shells` by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_assistance_spawning_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, filter as needed. Add additional
  shells as needed.
