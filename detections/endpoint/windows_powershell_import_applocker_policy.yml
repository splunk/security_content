description: The following analytic detects the import of Windows PowerShell Applocker cmdlets, specifically identifying the use of "Import-Module Applocker" and "Set-AppLockerPolicy" with an XML policy. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104) to capture and analyze script block text. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to enforce restrictive Applocker policies, potentially used by malware like Azorult to disable antivirus products. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to bypass security controls, leading to further system compromise and persistence.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText="*Import-Module Applocker*" ScriptBlockText="*Set-AppLockerPolicy *" ScriptBlockText="* -XMLPolicy *" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_powershell_import_applocker_policy_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: administrators may execute this command that may cause some false positive.
