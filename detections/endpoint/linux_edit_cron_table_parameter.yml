description: 'The following analytic detects the suspicious editing of cron jobs in
  Linux using the crontab command-line parameter (-e). It identifies this activity
  by monitoring command-line executions involving ''crontab'' and the edit parameter.
  This behavior is significant for a SOC as cron job manipulations can indicate unauthorized
  persistence attempts or scheduled malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could lead to system compromise, unauthorized access, or broader network
  compromise.'

- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = crontab
  Processes.process = "*crontab *" Processes.process = "* -e*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_edit_cron_table_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
