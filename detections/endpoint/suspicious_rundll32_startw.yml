description: The following analytic identifies the execution of rundll32.exe with
  the DLL function names "Start" and "StartW," commonly associated with Cobalt Strike
  payloads. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on command-line executions and process metadata. This activity
  is significant as it often indicates the presence of malicious payloads, such as
  Cobalt Strike, which can lead to unauthorized code execution. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow attackers to inject shellcode, escalate privileges, and
  maintain persistence within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` Processes.process=*start*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use Start
  as a function and call it via the command line. Filter as needed.
