description: The following analytic identifies rundll32.exe executing a DLL function
  name, Start and StartW, on the command line that is commonly observed with Cobalt
  Strike x86 and x64 DLL payloads. Rundll32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32
  and C:\Windows\syswow64. Typically, the DLL will be written and loaded from a world
  writeable path or user location. In most instances it will not have a valid certificate
  (Unsigned). During investigation, review the parent process and other parallel application
  execution. Capture and triage the DLL in question. In the instance of Cobalt Strike,
  rundll32.exe is the default process it opens and injects shellcode into. This default
  process can be changed, but typically is not.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` Processes.process=*start*

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use Start
  as a function and call it via the command line. Filter as needed.
