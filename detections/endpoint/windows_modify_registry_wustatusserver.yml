description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious registry modification of Windows auto update configuration. 
  This technique was being abused by several adversaries, malware authors and also red-teamers to bypass detection or 
  to be able to compromise the target host with zero day exploit or as an additional defense evasion technique.
  RedLine Stealer is one of the malware we've seen that uses this technique to evade detection and add more payload on the target host.
  This detection looks for registry modification related to the server to which reporting information will be sent for client computers 
  that use the WSUS server configured by the WUServer key. This policy is paired with WUServer; both must be set to the same value in order for them to be valid.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry 
  where Registry.registry_path="*\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\WUStatusServer"
  by Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.registry_key_name

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `windows_modify_registry_wustatusserver_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
