description: This analytic identifies an endpoint that remotely connects to another
  endpoint to create a new service using sc.exe. On the remote endpoint, the new service
  will be created and this action will trigger the creation of EventCode 7045 along
  with all the resulting service information.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=sc.exe
  Processes.process IN ("*create*")  Processes.process="*\\\\*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Note that false positives may occur, and filtering may be necessary,
  especially when it comes to remote service creation by administrators or software
  management utilities.
