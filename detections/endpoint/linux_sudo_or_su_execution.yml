description: The following analytic detects the execution of the "sudo" or "su" command
  on a Linux operating system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and parent process names. This activity
  is significant because "sudo" and "su" commands are commonly used by adversaries
  to elevate privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over
  the system. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute
  commands with root privileges, leading to severe security breaches, data exfiltration,
  or further system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN ("sudo",
  "su") OR Processes.parent_process_name IN ("sudo", "su") by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_sudo_or_su_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
