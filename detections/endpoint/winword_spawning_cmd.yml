description: The following detection identifies Microsoft Word spawning `cmd.exe`.
  Typically, this is not common behavior and not default with winword.exe. Winword.exe
  will generally be found in the following path `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16`
  (version will vary). Cmd.exe spawning from winword.exe is common for a spearphishing
  attachment and is actively used. Albeit, the command-line will indicate what is
  being executed. During triage, review parallel processes and identify any files
  that may have been written. It is possible that COM is utilized to trampoline the
  child process to `explorer.exe` or `wmiprvse.exe`.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=winword.exe

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present,
  filter as needed.
