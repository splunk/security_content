description: The following detection identifies Microsoft Word spawning `cmd.exe`.
  Typically, this is not common behavior and not default with winword.exe. Winword.exe
  will generally be found in the following path `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16`
  (version will vary). Cmd.exe spawning from winword.exe is common for a spearphishing
  attachment and is actively used. Albeit, the command-line will indicate what is
  being executed. During triage, review parallel processes and identify any files
  that may have been written. It is possible that COM is utilized to trampoline the
  child process to `explorer.exe` or `wmiprvse.exe`.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=winword.exe
  `process_cmd` by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `winword_spawning_cmd_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present,
  filter as needed.
