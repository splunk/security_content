- Endpoint
description: This analytic will identify a suspicious command-line that disables a
  user account using the `net.exe` utility native to Windows. This technique may used
  by the adversaries to interrupt availability of such users to do their malicious
  act.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process values(Processes.process_id)
  as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_net` AND Processes.process="*user*" AND Processes.process="*/active:no*"
  by  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `disabling_net_user_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
