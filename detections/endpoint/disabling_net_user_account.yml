description: This analytic will identify a suspicious command-line that disables a
  user account using the `net.exe` utility native to Windows. This technique may used
  by the adversaries to interrupt availability of such users to do their malicious
  act.

  values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process values(Processes.process_id)

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
