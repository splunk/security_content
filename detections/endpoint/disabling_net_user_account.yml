description: This analytic will identify a suspicious command-line that disables a
  user account using the `net.exe` utility native to Windows. This technique may used
  by the adversaries to interrupt availability of such users to do their malicious
  act.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process values(Processes.process_id)
  as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name="net.exe" OR Processes.process_name="net1.exe" AND
  Processes.process="*user*" AND Processes.process="*/active:no*" by  Processes.process_name
  Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `disabling_net_user_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe/net1.exe may be
  used.
