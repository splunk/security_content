description:
  This detection identifies when the SID of a privileged user is added to
  the SID History attribute of another user. Useful for tracking SID history abuse
  across multiple domains. This detection leverages the Asset and Identities
  framework. See the implementation section for further details on configuration.
search:
  '`wineventlog_security` (EventCode=4742 OR EventCode=4738) NOT SidHistory IN ("%%1793", -)
  | rex field=SidHistory "(^%{|^)(?P<SidHistory>.*?)(}$|$)"
  | eval category="privileged"
  | lookup identity_lookup_expanded category, identity as SidHistory OUTPUT identity_tag as match
  | where isnotnull(match)
  | rename TargetSid as userSid
  | table _time action status host user userSid SidHistory Logon_ID src_user
  | `windows_ad_privileged_account_sid_history_addition_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  Ensure you have objectSid and the Down Level Logon Name `DOMAIN\sAMACountName`
  added to the identity field of your Asset and Identities lookup, along with the
  category of privileged for the applicable users. Ensure you are
  ingesting eventcodes 4742 and 4738. Two advanced audit policies
  `Audit User Account Management` and `Audit Computer Account Management` under
  `Account Management` are required to generate these event codes.
known_false_positives: Migration of privileged accounts.
