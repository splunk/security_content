description: The following analytic identifies when the SID of a privileged user is
  added to the SID History attribute of another user. It leverages Windows Security
  Event Codes 4742 and 4738, combined with identity lookups, to detect this activity.
  This behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to abuse SID history
  for unauthorized access across multiple domains. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow an attacker to escalate privileges or maintain persistent access within
  the environment, posing a significant security risk.
search: '`wineventlog_security` (EventCode=4742 OR EventCode=4738) NOT SidHistory
  IN ("%%1793", -) | rex field=SidHistory "(^%{|^)(?P<SidHistory>.*?)(}$|$)" | eval
  category="privileged" | lookup identity_lookup_expanded category, identity as SidHistory
  OUTPUT identity_tag as match | where isnotnull(match) | rename TargetSid as userSid
  | table _time action status host user userSid SidHistory Logon_ID src_user | `windows_ad_privileged_account_sid_history_addition_filter`'
how_to_implement: Ensure you have objectSid and the Down Level Logon Name `DOMAIN\sAMACountName`
  added to the identity field of your Asset and Identities lookup, along with the
  category of privileged for the applicable users. Ensure you are ingesting eventcodes
  4742 and 4738. Two advanced audit policies `Audit User Account Management` and `Audit
  Computer Account Management` under `Account Management` are required to generate
  these event codes.
known_false_positives: Migration of privileged accounts.
