description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS klist.exe tool. 
  This tool is being abused or used by several post exploitation tool such as winpeas that being used by ransomware prestige
  to display or gather list of currently cached kerberos ticket. This cahced data can be used for lateral movement or even privilege escalation on the targeted 
  host. This hunting query can be a good pivot in possible kerberos attack or pass the hash technique. 
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name="klist.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name = "klist.exe" Processes.parent_process_name IN ("cmd.exe", "powershell*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid 
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_steal_or_forge_kerberos_tickets_klist_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
