description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS klist.exe
  tool. This tool is being abused or used by several post exploitation tool such as
  winpeas that being used by ransomware prestige to display or gather list of currently
  cached kerberos ticket. This cahced data can be used for lateral movement or even
  privilege escalation on the targeted host. This hunting query can be a good pivot
  in possible kerberos attack or pass the hash technique.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="klist.exe"
  OR Processes.original_file_name = "klist.exe" Processes.parent_process_name IN ("cmd.exe",
  "powershell*") by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_steal_or_forge_kerberos_tickets_klist_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
