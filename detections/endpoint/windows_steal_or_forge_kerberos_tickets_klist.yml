description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the Windows OS tool
  klist.exe, often used by post-exploitation tools like winpeas. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and
  parent process details. Monitoring klist.exe is significant as it can indicate attempts
  to list or gather cached Kerberos tickets, which are crucial for lateral movement
  or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable attackers
  to move laterally within the network or escalate privileges, posing a severe security
  risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="klist.exe"
  OR Processes.original_file_name = "klist.exe" Processes.parent_process_name IN ("cmd.exe",
  "powershell*") by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_steal_or_forge_kerberos_tickets_klist_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
