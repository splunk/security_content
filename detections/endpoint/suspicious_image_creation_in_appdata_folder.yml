name: Suspicious Image Creation In Appdata Folder

description: The following analytic detects the creation of image files in the AppData folder by processes that also have a file reference in the same folder. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Processes and Endpoint.Filesystem datamodels to identify this behavior. This activity is significant because it is commonly associated with malware, such as the Remcos RAT, which captures screenshots and stores them in the AppData folder before exfiltrating them to a command-and-control server. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate unauthorized data capture and exfiltration, compromising sensitive information and user privacy.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
