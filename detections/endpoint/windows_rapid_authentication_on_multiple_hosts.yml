description: The following analytic leverages Event ID 4624 to identify a source computer authenticating to a large number of remote endpoints within an Active Directory network.
  Specifically, the logic will trigger when a source endpoint authenticates to 30 or more target computers within a 5 minute timespan. This behavior could represent an adversary who is
  moving laterally across the environment or enumerating network shares in the search for sensitive files.
  As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this detection as needed.
search: '  `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4624 LogonType=3 TargetUserName!="ANONYMOUS LOGON" TargetUserName!="*$"
  | bucket span=5m _time
  | stats dc(Computer) AS unique_targets values(Computer) as host_targets by _time, IpAddress, TargetUserName
  | where unique_targets > 30
  | `windows_rapid_authentication_on_multiple_hosts_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Vulnerability scanners or system administration tools may also trigger this detection. Filter as needed.
