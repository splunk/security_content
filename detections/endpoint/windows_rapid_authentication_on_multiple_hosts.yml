description: The following analytic detects a source computer authenticating to 30
  or more remote endpoints within a 5-minute timespan using Event ID 4624. This behavior
  is identified by analyzing Windows Event Logs for LogonType 3 events and counting
  unique target computers. Such activity is significant as it may indicate lateral
  movement or network share enumeration by an adversary. If confirmed malicious, this
  could lead to unauthorized access to multiple systems, potentially compromising
  sensitive data and escalating privileges within the network.
search: '  `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4624 LogonType=3 TargetUserName!="ANONYMOUS
  LOGON" TargetUserName!="*$" | bucket span=5m _time | stats dc(Computer) AS unique_targets
  values(Computer) as host_targets by _time, IpAddress, TargetUserName | where unique_targets
  > 30 | `windows_rapid_authentication_on_multiple_hosts_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Vulnerability scanners or system administration tools may also
  trigger this detection. Filter as needed.
