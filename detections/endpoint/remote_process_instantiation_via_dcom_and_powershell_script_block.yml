description: The following analytic detects the execution of PowerShell commands that initiate a process on a remote endpoint via the DCOM protocol. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify the use of ShellExecute and ExecuteShellCommand. This activity is significant as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on remote systems, potentially leading to further compromise and persistence within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText="*Document.Application.ShellExecute*" OR ScriptBlockText="*Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer user_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_process_instantiation_via_dcom_and_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup instructions can be found https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage DCOM to start a process on remote systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
