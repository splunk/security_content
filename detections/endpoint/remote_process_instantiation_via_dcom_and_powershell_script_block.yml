datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of PowerShell with arguments utilized to start a process
  on a remote endpoint by abusing the DCOM protocol. Specifically, this search looks
  for the abuse of ShellExecute and ExecuteShellCommand. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may abuse DCOM for lateral movement and remote code execution.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (Message="*Document.Application.ShellExecute*"
  OR Message="*Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand*") | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Message ComputerName User | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `remote_process_instantiation_via_dcom_and_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup instructions
  can be found https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage DCOM to start a process on remote
  systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
