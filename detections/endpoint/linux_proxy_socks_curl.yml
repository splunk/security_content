description: The following analytic identifies curl being utilized with a proxy based
  on command-line arguments - -x, socks, --preproxy and --proxy. This behavior is
  built into the MetaSploit Framework as a auxiliary module. What does socks buy an
  adversary? SOCKS4a extends the SOCKS4 protocol to allow a client to specify a destination
  domain name rather than an IP address. The SOCKS5 protocol is defined in RFC 1928.
  It is an incompatible extension of the SOCKS4 protocol; it offers more choices for
  authentication and adds support for IPv6 and UDP, the latter of which can be used
  for DNS lookups. The protocols, and a proxy itself, allow an adversary to evade
  controls in place monitoring traffic, making it harder for the defender to identify
  and track activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on proxy usage internally.
  Filter as needed.
