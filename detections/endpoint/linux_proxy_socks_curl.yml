description: The following analytic identifies curl being utilized with a proxy based on command-line arguments - -x, socks, --preproxy and --proxy. This behavior is built into the MetaSploit Framework as a auxiliary module. What does socks buy an adversary? 
  SOCKS4a extends the SOCKS4 protocol to allow a client to specify a destination domain name rather than an IP address.
  The SOCKS5 protocol is defined in RFC 1928. It is an incompatible extension of the SOCKS4 protocol; it offers more choices for authentication and adds support for IPv6 and UDP, the latter of which can be used for DNS lookups.
  The protocols, and a proxy itself, allow an adversary to evade controls in place monitoring traffic, making it harder for the defender to identify and track activity.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=curl
  Processes.process IN ("*-x *", "*socks4a://*", "*socks5h://*", "*socks4://*","*socks5://*", "*--preproxy *", "--proxy*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_proxy_socks_curl_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on proxy usage internally. Filter as needed.
