type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the "At" application
  in Linux, which can be used by attackers to create persistence entries on a compromised
  host. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and parent process names associated with "at" or "atd".
  This activity is significant because the "At" application can be exploited to maintain
  unauthorized access or deliver additional malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could lead to data theft, ransomware attacks, or other severe consequences.
  Immediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of the execution
  and mitigate potential risks.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL comm IN ("at", "atd") OR exe IN ("/usr/bin/at","/usr/bin/atd")
  AND NOT (UID IN("daemon")) | rename host as dest | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by comm exe  SYSCALL UID ppid pid dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_at_application_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
