name: Windows Raccine Scheduled Task Deletion

status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies the deletion of the Raccine Rules Updater
  scheduled task using the `schtasks.exe` command. This detection leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions. This activity is significant because adversaries may delete this task
  to disable Raccine, a tool designed to prevent ransomware attacks. If confirmed
  malicious, this action could allow ransomware to execute without interference, leading
  to potential data encryption and loss.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  Processes.process="*delete*" AND Processes.process="*Raccine*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_raccine_scheduled_task_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however filter as needed.
