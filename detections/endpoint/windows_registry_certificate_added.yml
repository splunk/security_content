description: The following analytic identifies installation of a root CA certificate
  by monitoring the registry. The base paths may be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mattifestation/75d6117707bcf8c26845b3cbb6ad2b6b/raw/ae65ef15c706140ffc2e165615204e20f2903028/RootCAInstallationDetection.xml).
  In short, there are specific certificate registry paths that will be written to
  (SetValue) when a new certificate is added. The high-fidelity events to pay attention
  to are SetValue events where the TargetObject property ends with "<THUMBPRINT_VALUE>\Blob"
  as this indicates the direct installation or modification of a root certificate
  binary blob. The other high fidelity reference will be which process is making the
  registry modifications. There are very few processes that modify these day to day,
  therefore monitoring for all to start (hunting) provides a great beginning.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  where Registry.registry_path IN ("*\\certificates\\*") AND Registry.registry_value_name="Blob"
  by _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name
  Registry.process_guid Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_data |

  | `windows_registry_certificate_added_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Registry` node.
  In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest
  TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to a legitimate business applicating
  consistently adding new root certificates to the endpoint. Filter by user, process,
  or thumbprint.
