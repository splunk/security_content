description: The following analytic detects the installation of a root CA certificate
  by monitoring specific registry paths for SetValue events. It leverages data from
  the Endpoint datamodel, focusing on registry paths containing "certificates" and
  registry values named "Blob." This activity is significant because unauthorized
  root CA certificates can compromise the integrity of encrypted communications and
  facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an
  attacker to intercept, decrypt, or manipulate sensitive data, leading to severe
  security breaches.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 12 
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  where Registry.registry_path IN ("*\\certificates\\*") AND Registry.registry_value_name="Blob"
  by _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name
  Registry.process_guid Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_data |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_registry_certificate_added_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Registry` node.
  In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest
  TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to a legitimate business applicating
  consistently adding new root certificates to the endpoint. Filter by user, process,
  or thumbprint.
