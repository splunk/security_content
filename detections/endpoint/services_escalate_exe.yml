description: The following analytic identifies the use of `svc-exe` with Cobalt Strike.
  The behavior typically follows after an adversary has already gained initial access
  and is escalating privileges. Using `svc-exe`, a randomly named binary will be downloaded
  from the remote Teamserver and placed on disk within `C:\Windows\400619a.exe`. Following,
  the binary will be added to the registry under key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\400619a\`
  with multiple keys and values added to look like a legitimate service. Upon loading,
  `services.exe` will spawn the randomly named binary from `\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\400619a.exe`.
  The process lineage is completed with `400619a.exe` spawning rundll32.exe, which
  is the default `spawnto_` value for Cobalt Strike. The `spawnto_` value is arbitrary
  and may be any process on disk (typically system32/syswow64 binary). The `spawnto_`
  process will also contain a network connection. During triage, review parallel procesess
  and identify any additional file modifications.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=services.exe
  Processes.process_path=*admin$* by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `services_escalate_exe_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that
  DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as `services.exe` should
  never spawn a process from `ADMIN$`. Filter as needed.
