description: The following analytic identifies the use of `svc-exe` with Cobalt Strike.
  The behavior typically follows after an adversary has already gained initial access
  and is escalating privileges. Using `svc-exe`, a randomly named binary will be downloaded
  from the remote Teamserver and placed on disk within `C:\Windows\400619a.exe`. Following,
  the binary will be added to the registry under key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\400619a\`
  with multiple keys and values added to look like a legitimate service. Upon loading,
  `services.exe` will spawn the randomly named binary from `\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\400619a.exe`.
  The process lineage is completed with `400619a.exe` spawning rundll32.exe, which
  is the default `spawnto_` value for Cobalt Strike. The `spawnto_` value is arbitrary
  and may be any process on disk (typically system32/syswow64 binary). The `spawnto_`
  process will also contain a network connection. During triage, review parallel procesess
  and identify any additional file modifications.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as `services.exe` should
  never spawn a process from `ADMIN$`. Filter as needed.
