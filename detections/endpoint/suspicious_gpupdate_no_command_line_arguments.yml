description: The following analytic identifies gpupdate.exe with no command line arguments.
  It is unusual for gpupdate.exe to execute with no command line arguments present.
  This particular behavior is common with malicious software, including Cobalt Strike.
  During investigation, identify any network connections and parallel processes. Identify
  any suspicious module loads related to credential dumping or file writes. gpupdate.exe
  is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=1 (process_name=gpupdate.exe OR OriginalFileName=GPUpdate.exe)
  | regex CommandLine="(gpupdate\.exe.{0,4}$)" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest, User, ParentImage,ParentCommandLine, process_name,
  OriginalFileName, process_path, CommandLine | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_gpupdate_no_command_line_arguments_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present in small environments.
  Tuning may be required based on parent process.
