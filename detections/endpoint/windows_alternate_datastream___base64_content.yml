description: The following analytic detects the creation of Alternate Data Streams (ADS) with Base64 content on Windows systems. It leverages Sysmon EventID 15, which captures file creation events, including the content of named streams. ADS can conceal malicious payloads, making them significant for SOC monitoring. This detection identifies hidden streams that may contain executables, scripts, or configuration data, often used by malware to evade detection. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to hide and execute payloads, persist in the environment, or access sensitive information without being easily detected.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 15
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=15 NOT Contents IN ("-","[ZoneTransfer]*") | regex TargetFilename="(?<!\/)\b\w+(\.\w+)?:\w+(\.\w+)?$" | regex Contents="(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{128,})(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{2}==|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{3}=)?$" | eval file_name = replace(TargetFilename,"(.*\\\)",""), process = Image , file_path = TargetFilename , base64 = Contents, file_hash = coalesce(SHA256,SHA1,MD5,Hash) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user) as user by dest, process, process_guid, file_name, file_path, file_hash, base64 | `base64decode(base64)` | fields - base64 | rename base64_decode as command | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_alternate_datastream___base64_content_filter`'
how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest sysmon data, specifically Event ID 15.
