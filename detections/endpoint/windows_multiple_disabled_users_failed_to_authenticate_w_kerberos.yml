description: 'The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique disabled domain users using the Kerberos protocol within 5 minutes. This behavior could
  represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory
  environment using Kerberos to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. 
  Active Directory environments can be very different depending on the organization. Users should test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed.
  As attackers
  progress in a breach, mistakes will be made. In certain scenarios, adversaries may
  execute a password spraying attack against disabled users. Event 4768 is generated
  every time the Key Distribution Center issues a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket
  (TGT). Failure code `0x12` stands for `clients credentials have been revoked` (account
  disabled, expired or locked out).\

  This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.
  This detection will only trigger on domain controllers, not on member servers or workstations.\

  The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by
  providing fields like source ip and attempted user accounts.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple disabled domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, multi-user systems missconfigured
  systems.
