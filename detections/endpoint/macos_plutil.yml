description: The following analytic detects the usage of the `plutil` command to modify
  plist files on macOS systems. It leverages osquery to monitor process events, specifically
  looking for executions of `/usr/bin/plutil`. This activity is significant because
  adversaries can use `plutil` to alter plist files, potentially adding malicious
  binaries or command-line arguments that execute upon user logon or system startup.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to achieve persistence, execute
  arbitrary code, or escalate privileges, posing a significant threat to the system's
  security.
data_source:
- osquery
search: '`osquery_macro` name=es_process_events columns.path=/usr/bin/plutil | rename columns.*
  as * | stats count  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by username host
  cmdline pid path parent signing_id | rename username as user, cmdline as process,
  path as process_path, host as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `macos_plutil_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection uses osquery and endpoint security on MacOS. Follow
  the link in references, which describes how to setup process auditing in MacOS with
  endpoint security and osquery.
known_false_positives: Administrators using plutil to change plist files.
