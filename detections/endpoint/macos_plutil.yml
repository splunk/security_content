description: The following analytic detects the usage of the `plutil` command to modify plist files on macOS systems. It leverages osquery to monitor process events, specifically looking for executions of `/usr/bin/plutil`. This activity is significant because adversaries can use `plutil` to alter plist files, potentially adding malicious binaries or command-line arguments that execute upon user logon or system startup. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to achieve persistence, execute arbitrary code, or escalate privileges, posing a significant threat to the system's security.

how_to_implement: This detection uses osquery and endpoint security on MacOS. Follow the link in references, which describes how to setup process auditing in MacOS with endpoint security and osquery.
known_false_positives: Administrators using plutil to change plist files.
