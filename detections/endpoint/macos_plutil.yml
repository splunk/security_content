description: Detect usage of plutil to modify plist files. Adversaries can modiy plist files to executed binaries or add command line
  arguments. Plist files in auto-run locations are executed upon user logon or system startup.

  | rename columns.* as *
  | stats count  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by username host cmdline pid path parent signing_id
  | rename username as User, cmdline as process, path as process_path
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `macos_plutil_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection uses osquery and endpoint security on MacOS.
  Follow the link in references, which describes how to setup process auditing in MacOS
  with endpoint security and osquery.
known_false_positives: Administrators using plutil to change plist files.
