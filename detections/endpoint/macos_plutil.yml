status: production
type: TTP
description: Detect usage of plutil to modify plist files. Adversaries can modiy plist
  files to executed binaries or add command line arguments. Plist files in auto-run
  locations are executed upon user logon or system startup.
data_source:
- osquery
search: '`osquery` name=es_process_events columns.path=/usr/bin/plutil | rename columns.*
  as * | stats count  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by username host
  cmdline pid path parent signing_id | rename username as user, cmdline as process,
  path as process_path, host as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `macos_plutil_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection uses osquery and endpoint security on MacOS. Follow
  the link in references, which describes how to setup process auditing in MacOS with
  endpoint security and osquery.
known_false_positives: Administrators using plutil to change plist files.
