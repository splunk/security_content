description: The following analytics uses Windows Event Id 7045, `New Service Was
  Installed`, to identify the creation of a Windows Service where the service binary
  path path is located in a non-common Service folder in Windows. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may create malicious Services for lateral movement or remote code execution
  as well as persistence and execution. The Clop ransomware has also been seen in
  the wild abusing Windows services.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: ' `wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045  Service_File_Name = "*.exe" NOT (Service_File_Name
  IN ("*:\\Windows\\*", "*:\\Program File*", "*:\\Programdata\\*", "*%systemroot%\\*"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Service_File_Name
  Service_Name Service_Start_Type Service_Type dest user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_created_with_suspicious_service_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may install services with uncommon
  services paths.
