description: The following analytic detects the creation of a Windows Service with
  a binary path located in uncommon directories, using Windows Event ID 7045. It leverages
  logs from the `wineventlog_system` to identify services installed outside typical
  system directories. This activity is significant as adversaries, including those
  deploying Clop ransomware, often create malicious services for lateral movement,
  remote code execution, persistence, and execution. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow attackers to maintain persistence, execute arbitrary code, and potentially
  escalate privileges, posing a severe threat to the environment.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log System 7045
search: ' `wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ImagePath = "*.exe" NOT (ImagePath IN
  ("*:\\Windows\\*", "*:\\Program File*", "*:\\Programdata\\*", "*%systemroot%\\*"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ImagePath
  ServiceName ServiceType StartType Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_created_with_suspicious_service_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may install services with uncommon
  services paths.
