description: Command lines that are extremely long may be indicative of malicious
  activity on your hosts.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships, from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the process
  field in the Endpoint data model.

known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications start with long command lines.
