description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to change Windows Defender 
  Quick Scan Interval. The "QuickScanInterval" in Windows Defender, specifically within the context of antivirus software, 
  typically refers to the interval or frequency at which the system conducts quick scans for malware or potential threats.
  This setting dictates how often Windows Defender performs quick scans on the system. Quick scans are less comprehensive 
  than full system scans but provide a faster way to check critical areas for potential threats or malware.
  This registry setting is being abuse by several threat actors, adversaries and red teamers to bypasses Windows defender detections.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows Defender\\Scan\\QuickScanInterval" 
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action Registry.dest

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
