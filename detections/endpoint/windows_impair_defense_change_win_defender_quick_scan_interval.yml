description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that change the Windows Defender Quick Scan Interval. It leverages data from the
  Endpoint.Registry data model, focusing on changes to the "QuickScanInterval" registry
  path. This activity is significant because altering the scan interval can impair
  Windows Defender's ability to detect malware promptly, potentially allowing threats
  to persist undetected. If confirmed malicious, this modification could enable attackers
  to bypass security measures, maintain persistence, and execute further malicious
  activities without being detected by quick scans.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\Scan\\QuickScanInterval" by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_change_win_defender_quick_scan_interval_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
