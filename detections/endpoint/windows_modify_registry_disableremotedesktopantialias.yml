description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  key "DisableRemoteDesktopAntiAlias" with a value set to 0x00000001. This detection
  leverages data from the Endpoint datamodel, specifically monitoring changes in the
  Registry node. This activity is significant as it may indicate the presence of DarkGate
  malware, which alters this registry setting to enhance its remote desktop capabilities.
  If confirmed malicious, this modification could allow an attacker to maintain persistence
  and control over the compromised host, potentially leading to further exploitation
  and data exfiltration.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path = "*\\Terminal
  Services\\DisableRemoteDesktopAntiAlias"  Registry.registry_value_data = 0x00000001

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_disableremotedesktopantialias_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
