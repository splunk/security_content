description: The following hunting analytic will assist with identifying new .sys
  files introduced in the environment. This query is meant to identify sys file creates
  on disk. There will be noise, but reducing common process names or applications
  should help to limit any volume. The idea is to identify new sys files written to
  disk and identify them before they're added as a new kernel mode driver.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_name="*.sys*"
  by _time span=1h Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name
  Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.file_hash | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `windows_system_file_on_disk_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on files from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node.
  In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest
  TA for the endpoint product. In addition, filtering may occur by adding NOT (Filesystem.file_path
  IN ("*\\Windows\\*", "*\\Program File*", "*\\systemroot\\*","%SystemRoot%*", "system32\*")).
  This will level out the noise generated to potentally lead to generating notables.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present. Filter as needed.
