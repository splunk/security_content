description: The following analytic detects the use of the `[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator
  in PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to query Active Directory for
  domain organizational units. This detection leverages PowerShell operational logs
  to identify script blocks containing `[adsisearcher]`, `objectcategory=organizationalunit`,
  and `findAll()`. This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance
  efforts by adversaries to gain situational awareness of the domain structure. If
  confirmed malicious, this could lead to further exploitation, such as privilege
  escalation or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*[adsisearcher]*" ScriptBlockText
  = "*objectcategory=organizationalunit*" ScriptBlockText = "*findAll()*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer user_id | rename Computer as dest, user_id as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_linked_policies_in_adsi_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
