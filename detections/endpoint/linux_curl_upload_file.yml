description: The following analytic detects the use of the curl command with specific
  switches (-F, --form, --upload-file, -T, -d, --data, --data-raw, -I, --head) to
  upload AWS credentials or configuration files to a remote destination. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  executions and process details. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive AWS credentials, a technique known to be used
  by the TeamTNT group. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access
  and potential compromise of AWS resources.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Filtering may be required. In addition to AWS credentials,
  add other important files and monitor. The inverse would be to look for _all_ -F
  behavior and tune from there.
