description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of reg.exe with "restore" parameter. 
  This reg.exe parameter is commonly used to restore registry backup data in a targeted host. This approach or technique 
  was also seen in post-exploitation tool like winpeas where it uses "reg save" and "reg restore" to check the 
  registry modification restriction in targeted host after gaining access to it.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where  `process_reg` AND Processes.process = "* restore *" 
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid 
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_modify_registry_reg_restore_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this command tool to backup registry before updates or modifying critical registries.
