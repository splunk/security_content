description: The following analytic detects the execution of reg.exe with the "restore"
  parameter, indicating an attempt to restore registry backup data on a host. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process execution logs and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate post-exploitation actions, such as those performed by tools like
  winpeas, which use "reg save" and "reg restore" to manipulate registry settings.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to revert registry changes,
  potentially bypassing security controls and maintaining persistence.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  `process_reg` AND Processes.process
  = "* restore *" by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_reg_restore_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this command tool to backup registry
  before updates or modifying critical registries.
