description: This analytic identifies a suspicious registry modification to hide a
  user account on the Windows Login screen. This technique was seen in some tradecraft
  where the adversary will create a hidden user account with Admin privileges in login
  screen to avoid noticing by the user that they already compromise and to persist
  on that said machine.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Registry.registry_key_name)
  as registry_key_name values(Registry.registry_path) as registry_path min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path="*\\Windows
  NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\Userlist*" AND Registry.registry_value_data
  = "0x00000000" by Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_value_data | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `hide_user_account_from_sign_in_screen_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as CarbonBlack or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Filter as needed.
