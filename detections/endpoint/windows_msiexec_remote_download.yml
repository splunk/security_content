description: The following analytic detects the use of msiexec.exe with an HTTP or HTTPS URL in the command line, indicating a remote file download attempt. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to download and execute potentially malicious software from a remote server. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, or further malware deployment within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter by destination or parent process as needed.
