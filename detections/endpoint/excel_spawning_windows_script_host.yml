description: The following detection identifies Microsoft Excel spawning Windows Script
  Host - `cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe`. Typically, this is not common behavior and
  not default with Excel.exe. Excel.exe will generally be found in the following path
  `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16` (version will vary). `cscript.exe`
  or `wscript.exe` default location is `c:\windows\system32\` or c:windows\syswow64`.
  `cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe` spawning from Excel.exe is common for a spearphishing
  attachment and is actively used. Albeit, the command-line executed will most likely
  be obfuscated and captured via another detection. During triage, review parallel
  processes and identify any files that may have been written. Review the reputation
  of the remote destination and block accordingly.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.parent_process_name="excel.exe" Processes.process_name IN ("cscript.exe",
  "wscript.exe")  by Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.user
  Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `excel_spawning_windows_script_host_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present,
  filter as needed. In some instances, `cscript.exe` is used for legitimate business
  practices.
