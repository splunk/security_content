description: The following analytic identifies instances where Microsoft Excel spawns Windows Script Host processes (`cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe`). This behavior is detected using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process creation events where the parent process is `excel.exe`. This activity is significant because it is uncommon and often associated with malicious actions, such as spearphishing attacks. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute scripts, potentially leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or further system compromise. Immediate investigation and mitigation are recommended.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process) min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name="excel.exe" Processes.process_name IN ("cscript.exe", "wscript.exe")  by Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.user Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excel_spawning_windows_script_host_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present, filter as needed. In some instances, `cscript.exe` is used for legitimate business practices.
