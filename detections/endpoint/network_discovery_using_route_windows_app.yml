description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `route.exe` Windows
  application, commonly used for network discovery. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events. This activity
  is significant because adversaries often use `route.exe` to map network routes and
  identify potential targets within a network. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could allow attackers to gain insights into network topology, facilitating lateral
  movement and further exploitation. Note that false positives may occur due to legitimate
  administrative tasks or automated scripts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may utilize an
  automated host discovery application that may generate false positives or an amazon
  ec2 script that uses this application. Filter as needed.
