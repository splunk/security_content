description: The following analytic detects the creation of a Scheduled Task with
  a high entropy, randomly generated name, leveraging Event ID 4698. It uses the `ut_shannon`
  function from the URL ToolBox Splunk application to measure the entropy of the Task
  Name. This activity is significant as adversaries often use randomly named Scheduled
  Tasks for lateral movement and remote code execution, employing tools like Impacket
  or CrackMapExec. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code remotely, potentially leading to further compromise and persistence within
  the network.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4698
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698 | xmlkv Message | lookup ut_shannon_lookup
  word as Task_Name | where ut_shannon > 3 | table  _time, dest, Task_Name, ut_shannon,
  Command, Author, Enabled, Hidden | `randomly_generated_scheduled_task_name_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA as well
  as the URL ToolBox application are also required.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may use random Scheduled Task names.
