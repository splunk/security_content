description: This search is to detect execution of wevtutil.exe to disable logs. This
  technique was seen in several ransomware to disable the event logs to evade alerts
  and detections in compromised host.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
known_false_positives: network operator may disable audit event logs for debugging
  purposes.
