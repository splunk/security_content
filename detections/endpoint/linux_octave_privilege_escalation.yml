description: GNU Octave is a high-level programming language primarily intended for
  scientific computing and numerical computation. Octave helps in solving linear and
  nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using
  a language that is mostly compatible with MATLAB. If sudo right is given to the
  application for the user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly
  get a root shell.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*octave-cli*"

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
