description: The following analytic detects the execution of GNU Octave with elevated
  privileges, specifically when it runs system commands via sudo. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line
  arguments that include "octave-cli," "--eval," "system," and "sudo." This activity
  is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing
  a user to execute commands as root. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full
  system compromise, enabling an attacker to gain root access and execute arbitrary
  commands, severely impacting system security and integrity.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*octave-cli*"
  AND Processes.process="*--eval*" AND Processes.process="*system*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_octave_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
