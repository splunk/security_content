description: "The following analytic detects modifications to theregistry related to ValleyRAT C2 configuration. Specifically,  it monitors changes in registry keys where ValleyRAT saves the IP address and port information of its command-and-control (C2) server. This activity is a key indicator of ValleyRAT attempting to establish persistent communication with its C2 infrastructure. By identifying these unauthorized registry modifications, security analysts can quickly detect malicious configurations and investigate the associated threats. Early detection of these changes helps prevent further exploitation and limits the malware\u2019s ability to exfiltrate data or control infected systems."

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the official Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
