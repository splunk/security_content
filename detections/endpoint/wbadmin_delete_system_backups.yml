description: The following analytic detects the execution of wbadmin.exe with flags
  that delete backup files, specifically targeting catalog or system state backups.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because it
  is commonly used by ransomware to prevent recovery by deleting system backups. If
  confirmed malicious, this action could severely hinder recovery efforts, leading
  to prolonged downtime and potential data loss.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=wbadmin.exe
  Processes.process="*delete*" AND (Processes.process="*catalog*" OR Processes.process="*systemstatebackup*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `wbadmin_delete_system_backups_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may modify the boot configuration.
