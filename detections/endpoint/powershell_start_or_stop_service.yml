- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic identifies the use of PowerShell's Start-Service
  or Stop-Service cmdlets on an endpoint. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging
  to detect these commands. This activity is significant because attackers can manipulate
  services to disable or stop critical functions, causing system instability or disrupting
  business operations. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
  to disable security services, evade detection, or disrupt essential services, leading
  to potential system downtime and compromised security.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN ("*start-service*", "*stop-service*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode
  ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_start_or_stop_service_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: This behavior may be noisy, as these cmdlets are commonly used
  by system administrators or other legitimate users to manage services. Therefore,
  it is recommended not to enable this analytic as a direct notable or TTP. Instead,
  it should be used as part of a broader set of security controls to detect and investigate
  potential threats.
