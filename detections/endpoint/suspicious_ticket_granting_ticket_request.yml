description: As part of the sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller
  Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287) exploitation chain, adversaries will need to request
  a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) on behalf of the newly created and renamed
  computer account. The TGT request will be preceded by a computer account name event.
  This analytic leverages Event Id 4781, `The name of an account was changed` and
  event Id 4768 `A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested` to correlate
  a sequence of events where the new computer account on event id 4781 matches the
  request account on event id 4768. This behavior could represent an exploitation
  attempt of CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 for privilege escalation.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` (EventCode=4781 Old_Account_Name="*$" New_Account_Name!="*$")
  OR (EventCode=4768 Account_Name!="*$") | eval RenamedComputerAccount = coalesce(New_Account_Name,
  mvindex(Account_Name,0)) | transaction RenamedComputerAccount startswith=(EventCode=4781)
  endswith=(EventCode=4768) | eval short_lived=case((duration<2),"TRUE") | search
  short_lived = TRUE | table _time, ComputerName, EventCode, Account_Name,RenamedComputerAccount,
  short_lived |`suspicious_ticket_granting_ticket_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A computer account name change event inmediately followed by
  a kerberos TGT request with matching fields is unsual. However, legitimate behavior
  may trigger it. Filter as needed.
