description: The following analytic identifies odbcconf.exe, Windows Open Database
  Connectivity utility, utilizing the action function of regsvr to load a DLL. An
  example will look like - odbcconf.exe /A { REGSVR T1218-2.dll }. During triage,
  review parent process, parallel procesess and file modifications.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=odbcconf.exe
  Processes.process IN ("*/a *",  "*-a*") Processes.process="*regsvr*"  by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_odbcconf_load_dll_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may need to occur
  based on legitimate application usage. Filter as needed.
