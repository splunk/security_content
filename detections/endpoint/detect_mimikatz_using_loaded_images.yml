description: This search looks for reading loaded Images unique to credential dumping
  with Mimikatz. Deprecated because mimikatz libraries changed and very noisy sysmon
  Event Code.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 | stats values(ImageLoaded) as ImageLoaded values(ProcessId)
  as ProcessId by Computer, Image | search ImageLoaded=*WinSCard.dll ImageLoaded=*cryptdll.dll
  ImageLoaded=*hid.dll ImageLoaded=*samlib.dll ImageLoaded=*vaultcli.dll | rename
  Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_mimikatz_using_loaded_images_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs and a sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 7 with powershell.exe. This search uses an input macro named
  `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: Other tools can import the same DLLs. These tools should be
  part of a whitelist. False positives may be present with any process that authenticates
  or uses credentials, PowerShell included. Filter based on parent process.
