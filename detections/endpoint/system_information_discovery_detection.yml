search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process="*wmic* qfe*"
  OR Processes.process=*systeminfo* OR Processes.process=*hostname*) by Processes.user

  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | eventstats dc(process) as dc_processes_by_dest
  by dest | where dc_processes_by_dest > 2 | stats values(process) as process min(firstTime)
  as firstTime max(lastTime) as lastTime by user, dest parent_process_name | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `system_information_discovery_detection_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
