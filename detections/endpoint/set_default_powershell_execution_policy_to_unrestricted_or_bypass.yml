description: The following analytic detects changes to the PowerShell ExecutionPolicy
  in the registry to "Unrestricted" or "Bypass." It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on registry modifications under the path *Software\Microsoft\Powershell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell*.
  This activity is significant because setting the ExecutionPolicy to these values
  can allow the execution of potentially malicious scripts without restriction. If
  confirmed malicious, this could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code, leading
  to further compromise of the system and potential escalation of privileges.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may attempt to change the default execution
  policy on a system for a variety of reasons. However, setting the policy to "unrestricted"
  or "bypass" as this search is designed to identify, would be unusual. Hits should
  be reviewed and investigated as appropriate.
