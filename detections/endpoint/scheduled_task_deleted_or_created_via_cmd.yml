description: This analytic focuses on identifying the creation or deletion of scheduled
  tasks using the schtasks.exe utility with the corresponding command-line flags (-create
  or -delete). This technique has been notably associated with threat actors like
  Dragonfly and the SUNBURST attack against SolarWinds. The purpose of this analytic
  is to detect suspicious activity related to scheduled tasks that could indicate
  malicious intent or unauthorized system manipulation. By monitoring for these specific
  command-line flags, we can enhance our ability to identify potential threats and
  prevent attacks similar to the use of scheduled tasks in the BadRabbit Ransomware
  incident.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*delete* OR Processes.process=*create*) by Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `scheduled_task_deleted_or_created_via_cmd_filter` '
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: While it is possible for legitimate scripts or administrators
  to trigger this behavior, filtering can be applied based on the parent process and
  application to reduce false positives. Analysts should reference the provided references
  to understand the context and threat landscape associated with this activity.
