description: This search looks for flags passed to schtasks.exe on the command-line
  that indicate a task was created via command like. This has been associated with
  the Dragonfly threat actor, and the SUNBURST attack against Solarwinds.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*delete* OR Processes.process=*create*) by Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
known_false_positives: Tasks should not be manually created via CLI, this is rarely
  done by admins as well
