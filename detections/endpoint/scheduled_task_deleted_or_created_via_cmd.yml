description: The following analytic identifies the creation or deletion of scheduled
  tasks using the schtasks.exe utility with the -create or -delete flags. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
  and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it can indicate unauthorized
  system manipulation or malicious intent, often associated with threat actors like
  Dragonfly and incidents such as the SUNBURST attack. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could allow attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, or persist
  within the environment, posing a significant security risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*delete* OR Processes.process=*create*) by Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `scheduled_task_deleted_or_created_via_cmd_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: While it is possible for legitimate scripts or administrators
  to trigger this behavior, filtering can be applied based on the parent process and
  application to reduce false positives. Analysts should reference the provided references
  to understand the context and threat landscape associated with this activity.
