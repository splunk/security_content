name: Scheduled Task Deleted Or Created via CMD

description: This analytic focuses on identifying the creation or deletion of scheduled tasks using the schtasks.exe utility 
  with the corresponding command-line flags (-create or -delete). This technique has been notably associated with threat actors 
  like Dragonfly and the SUNBURST attack against SolarWinds. The purpose of this analytic is to detect suspicious activity 
  related to scheduled tasks that could indicate malicious intent or unauthorized system manipulation. By monitoring for these 
  specific command-line flags, we can enhance our ability to identify potential threats and prevent attacks similar to the use of 
  scheduled tasks in the BadRabbit Ransomware incident.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*delete* OR Processes.process=*create*) by Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `scheduled_task_deleted_or_created_via_cmd_filter` '
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: While it is possible for legitimate scripts or administrators to trigger this behavior, filtering can be applied based on the parent process and application to reduce false positives. Analysts should reference the provided references to understand the context and threat landscape associated with this activity.
