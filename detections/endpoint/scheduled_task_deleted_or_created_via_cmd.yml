datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies the creation or deletion of a scheduled
  task using schtasks.exe with flags - create or delete being passed on the command-line.
  This has been associated with the Dragonfly threat actor, and the SUNBURST attack
  against Solarwinds. This analytic replaces "Scheduled Task used in BadRabbit Ransomware".
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*delete* OR Processes.process=*create*) by Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `scheduled_task_deleted_or_created_via_cmd_filter` '
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: It is possible scripts or administrators may trigger this analytic.
  Filter as needed based on parent process, application.
