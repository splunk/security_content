description: The following analytic detects a rundll32 process creating executable
  (.exe) or dynamic link library (.dll) files. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 11 to
  identify instances where rundll32.exe generates these file types. This activity
  is significant because rundll32 is often exploited by malware, such as IcedID, to
  drop malicious payloads in directories like Temp, AppData, or ProgramData. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, establish
  persistence, or escalate privileges within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11 Image="*rundll32.exe" TargetFilename IN ("*.exe", "*.dll")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image TargetFilename
  Computer | rename Computer as dest | rename TargetFilename as file_name | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rundll32_process_creating_exe_dll_files_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, TargetFilename, and eventcode 11 executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
