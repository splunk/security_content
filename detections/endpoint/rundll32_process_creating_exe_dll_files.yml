description: This search is to detect a suspicious rundll32 process that drops executable
  (.exe or .dll) files. this behavior seen in rundll32 process of IcedID that tries
  to drop copy of itself in temp folder or download executable drop it either appdata
  or programdata as part of its execution.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11 process_name="rundll32.exe" TargetFilename IN ("*.exe",
  "*.dll",) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image
  TargetFilename ProcessGuid dest user_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rundll32_process_creating_exe_dll_files_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, TargetFilename, and eventcode 11 executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
