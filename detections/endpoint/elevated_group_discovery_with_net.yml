description: The following analytic detects the execution of `net.exe` or `net1.exe`
  with command-line arguments used to query elevated domain groups. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and
  command-line executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
  reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to identify high-privileged users within Active
  Directory. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to further attacks aimed
  at compromising privileged accounts, escalating privileges, or gaining unauthorized
  access to sensitive systems and data.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
