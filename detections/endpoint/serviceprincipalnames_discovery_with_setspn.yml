description: 'The following analytic identifies `setspn.exe` usage related to querying
  the domain for Service Principle Names. typically, this is a precursor activity
  related to kerberoasting or the silver ticket attack. \

  What is a ServicePrincipleName? \

  A service principal name (SPN) is a unique identifier of a service instance. SPNs
  are used by Kerberos authentication to associate a service instance with a service
  logon account. This allows a client application to request that the service authenticate
  an account even if the client does not have the account name.\

  Example usage includes the following \

  1. setspn -T offense -Q */* 1. setspn -T attackrange.local -F -Q MSSQLSvc/* 1. setspn
  -Q */* > allspns.txt 1. setspn -q \

  Values \

  1. -F = perform queries at the forest, rather than domain level 1. -T = perform
  query on the specified domain or forest (when -F is also used) 1. -Q = query for
  existence of SPN \

  During triage, review parallel processes for further suspicious activity.'
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be caused by Administrators resetting SPNs
  or querying for SPNs. Filter as needed.
