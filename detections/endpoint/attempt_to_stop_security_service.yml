description: This search looks for attempts to stop security-related services on the
  endpoint.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the file-system activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data-model node. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data. The search is shipped with a lookup file, `security_services.csv`,
  that can be edited to update the list of services to monitor. This lookup file can
  be edited directly where it lives in `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/DA-ESS-ContentUpdate/lookups`,
  or via the Splunk console. You should add the names of services an attacker might
  use on the command line and surround with asterisks (*****), so that they work properly
  when searching the command line. The file should be updated with the names of any
  services you would like to monitor for attempts to stop the service.,
