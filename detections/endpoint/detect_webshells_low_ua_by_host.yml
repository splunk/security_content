description: The following query identifies potential web shells through searching for web access that use rare user agents.  This will discover both instances where aggressors use an unusual or outdated, unusual or mistyped UA for access to web shells, or where the UA is used as the covert channel for C2.  It will not detect web shells that use a generic UA for access or C2.  This work expands on that done by ASD and NSA on webshells.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information from either local web server access logs or internal network proxy traffic.  Best results are from access log files.  Tuning can be done through adding to the list of known and acceptable low volume UAs, presently represented as ().
Data needs to be correctly parsed into CIM format and incorporated into the SplunkES datamodels.  If the data is not in CIM or in the data models it will be necessary to modify the field names and initial search line to fit your situation.
The search is to be executed daily with completion prior to midnight.  It operates over the entire summary period (default 3 months) and reports only on events for the day executed.
known_false_positives:This search will detect instances where the use of a UA for the host is rare, this is an characertstic for a webshell not a clear IOC.  This alert works best in aggregation such as the risk based alerting framework.
