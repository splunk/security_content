description: This analytic identifies potentially malicious 'netsh' processes that manipulate firewall configurations. 
  This behavior has been observed in the NJRAT malware, which deletes its added firewall rules as part of its cleanup process. 
  Leveraging this anomaly detection can be a valuable approach for detecting malware, such as NJRAT, 
  that makes alterations to firewall configurations as a component of its malicious activities.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator may modify or delete firewall configuration.
