- Windows Event Log Security 4663
description: The following analytic detects a suspicious query on the uninstall application
  list in the Windows OS registry. It leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically
  event code 4663, to identify access to the "Uninstall" registry key. This activity
  is significant because adversaries or malware can exploit this key to gather information
  about installed applications, aiding in further attacks. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to map out installed software, potentially identifying
  vulnerabilities or software to exploit, leading to further system compromise.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 object_file_path="\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by object_file_name
  object_file_path process_name process_path  process_id EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_query_registry_uninstall_program_list_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Uninstall application may access this registry to remove the
  entry of the target application. Filter is needed.
