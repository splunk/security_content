description: The following analytic identifies when the attacker tool Certify or Certipy
  are used to enumerate Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) environments.
  The default command line arguments of these tools are similar and perform near identical
  enumeration or exploitation functions.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN ("* find
  *","* auth *","* request *","* req *","* download *",) AND Processes.process IN
  ("* /vulnerable*","* /enrolleeSuppliesSubject *","* /json /outfile*","* /ca*", "*

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
