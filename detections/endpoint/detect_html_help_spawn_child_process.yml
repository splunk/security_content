name: Detect HTML Help Spawn Child Process

description: The following analytic detects the execution of hh.exe (HTML Help) spawning a child process, indicating the use of a Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file to execute Windows script code. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where hh.exe is the parent process. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts via CHM files, a known technique for bypassing security controls. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, potentially compromising the system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications (ex. web browsers) may spawn a child process. Filter as needed.
