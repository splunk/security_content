description: 'The following analytic utilizes Windows Security EventCode 4698, which
  indicates the creation of a scheduled task on a Windows system. The purpose of this
  query is to identify suspicious tasks that have been registered using either schtasks.exe
  or TaskService and involve executing a command from a user-writable file path.\

  When this analytic is triggered, it provides information such as the first and last
  registration time of the task, the command to be executed, the task name, author,
  and whether it is set as hidden or not. It is worth noting that schtasks.exe is
  commonly located in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64, and it loads the
  taskschd.dll DLL when launched. If this DLL is loaded by another process, it suggests
  that a scheduled task may be registered within that process''s context in memory.\

  During the triage process, it is essential to identify the source of the scheduled
  task creation, whether it was initiated through schtasks.exe or TaskService. The
  analyst should review the task that was created, including the command to be executed.
  Additionally, any artifacts on disk related to the task should be captured and analyzed.
  It is also recommended to identify any parallel processes that occurred within the
  same timeframe to determine the source of the task creation.\

  By conducting this triage process, security analysts can gain insights into potentially
  malicious or suspicious scheduled tasks, helping them identify the source and assess
  the impact of the task. This analytic is valuable for a Security Operations Center
  (SOC) as it can detect unauthorized or suspicious activity that could indicate an
  attacker''s attempt to establish persistence or execute unauthorized commands on
  the system.\'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate applications are
  allowed to register tasks in public paths. Filter as needed based on paths that
  are used legitimately.
