description: This analytic looks for suspicious file creation in kernel/driver directory
  in linux platform. This directory is known folder for all linux kernel module available
  within the system. so creation of file in this directory is a good indicator that
  there is a possible rootkit installation in the host machine. This technique was
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain high privileges to
  their malicious code such us in kernel level. Even this event is not so common administrator
  or legitimate 3rd party tool may install driver or linux kernel module as part of
  its installation.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/kernel/drivers/*")
  by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.file_path
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `linux_file_created_in_kernel_driver_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create file in this folders
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
