description: The following analytic identifies MSIExec with any network connection
  over port 443 or 80. Typically, MSIExec does not perform network communication to
  the internet.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_msiexec` by _time Processes.user Processes.process_id Processes.process_name Processes.dest

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | join  process_id

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present and filtering is required.
