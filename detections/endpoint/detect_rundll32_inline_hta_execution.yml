datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies "rundll32.exe" execution with inline
  protocol handlers. "JavaScript", "VBScript", and "About" are the only supported
  options when invoking HTA content directly on the command-line. This type of behavior
  is commonly observed with fileless malware or application whitelisting bypass techniques.
  The search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments
  were used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, process
  "rundll32.exe" and its parent process.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32`
  (Processes.process=*vbscript* OR Processes.process=*javascript* OR Processes.process=*about*)
  by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.dest  |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_rundll32_inline_hta_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
