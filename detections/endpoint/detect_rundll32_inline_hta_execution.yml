description: The following analytic detects the execution of "rundll32.exe" with inline
  protocol handlers such as "JavaScript", "VBScript", and "About". This behavior is
  identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line
  arguments. This activity is significant as it is often associated with fileless
  malware or application whitelisting bypass techniques. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, bypass security controls, and
  maintain persistence within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)

  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32`

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
