description: The following analytic detects a potentially malicious office document that creates
  a scheduled task entry either through a macro VBA API or by loading taskschd.dll. This
  technique has been observed in numerous instances of malicious macro malware aiming to establish persistence
  or beaconing through task schedule entries. The analytic will return the first and
  last time the task was registered, as well as details such as the `Command` to be executed,
  `Task Name`, `Author`, `Enabled` status, and whether it is `Hidden`. schtasks.exe
  is natively located in `C:\Windows\system32` and `C:\Windows\syswow64`. The DLL(s)
  `taskschd.dll` are loaded when schtasks.exe or TaskService is initiated. If this DLL is found loaded by another process, it may indicate that a scheduled task is being registered
  within that process's context in memory. During triage, determine the source of the scheduled
  task. Was it schtasks.exe or via TaskService? Review the job created and the command
  to be executed. Capture any artifacts on disk for further review. Identify any parallel
  processes within the same timeframe to pinpoint the source.'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 process_name IN ("WINWORD.EXE", "EXCEL.EXE",
    "POWERPNT.EXE","onenote.exe","onenotem.exe","onenoteviewer.exe","onenoteim.exe",
    "msaccess.exe") loaded_file_path = "*\\taskschd.dll" 
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime
      max(_time) as lastTime count by user_id, dest, process_name,loaded_file, loaded_file_path, original_file_name, process_guid
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `office_document_creating_schedule_task_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and ImageLoaded (Like sysmon EventCode 7) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Also be sure to include those monitored dll to your own sysmon config.
known_false_positives: False positives may occur if legitimate office documents are
  creating scheduled tasks. Ensure to investigate the scheduled task and the command
  to be executed. If the task is benign, add the task name to the exclusion list.
  Some applications may legitimately load taskschd.dll.
