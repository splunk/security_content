description: The following analytic detects an Office document creating a scheduled
  task, either through a macro VBA API or by loading `taskschd.dll`. This detection
  leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify when Office applications load the `taskschd.dll`
  file. This activity is significant as it is a common technique used by malicious
  macro malware to establish persistence or initiate beaconing. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to maintain persistence, execute arbitrary commands,
  or schedule future malicious activities, posing a significant threat to the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 process_name IN ("WINWORD.EXE", "EXCEL.EXE", "POWERPNT.EXE","onenote.exe","onenotem.exe","onenoteviewer.exe","onenoteim.exe",
  "msaccess.exe") loaded_file_path = "*\\taskschd.dll" | stats min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime count by user_id, dest, process_name,loaded_file, loaded_file_path,
  original_file_name, process_guid | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `office_document_creating_schedule_task_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and ImageLoaded (Like sysmon EventCode 7) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Also be sure to include those monitored dll to your own sysmon config.
known_false_positives: False positives may occur if legitimate office documents are
  creating scheduled tasks. Ensure to investigate the scheduled task and the command
  to be executed. If the task is benign, add the task name to the exclusion list.
  Some applications may legitimately load taskschd.dll.
