description: This search will return a table of rare processes, the names of the systems
  running them, and the users who initiated each process.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts and populating the endpoint data model
  with the resultant dataset. The macro `filter_rare_process_whitelist` searches two
  lookup files to whitelist your processes.  These consist of `rare_process_whitelist_default.csv`
  and `rare_process_whitelist_local.csv`. To add your own processes to the whitelist,
  add them to `rare_process_whitelist_local.csv`. If you wish to remove an entry from
  the default lookup file, you will have to modify the macro itself to set the whitelist
  value for that process to false. You can modify the limit parameter and search scheduling
  to better suit your environment.

known_false_positives: Some legitimate processes may be only rarely executed in your
  environment. As these are identified, update `rare_process_whitelist_local.csv`
  to filter them out of your search results.
