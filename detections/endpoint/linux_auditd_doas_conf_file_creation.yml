description: The following analytic detects the creation of the doas.conf file on
  a Linux host. This file is used by the doas utility to allow standard users to perform
  tasks as root, similar to sudo. The detection leverages Linux Auditd data, focusing on
  the creation of the doas.conf file. This activity is significant because it can
  indicate an attempt to gain elevated privileges, potentially by an adversary. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute commands with root
  commands with root privileges, leading to full system compromise.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Path
search: '`linux_auditd` type=PATH name ="/etc/doas.conf*" | rename host as dest |
  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by name nametype OGID type
  dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|

how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
