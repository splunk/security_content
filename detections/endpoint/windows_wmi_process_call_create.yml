description: The following analytic detects the execution of WMI command lines used
  to create or execute processes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line events that include specific keywords like
  "process," "call," and "create." This activity is significant because adversaries
  often use WMI to execute malicious payloads on local or remote hosts, potentially
  bypassing traditional security controls. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
  allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence
  within the environment, posing a severe threat to organizational security.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` Processes.process
  = "* process *" Processes.process = "* call *" Processes.process = "* create *"

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_wmi_process_call_create_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may execute this command for testing or auditing.
