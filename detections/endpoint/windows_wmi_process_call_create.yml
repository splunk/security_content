description: This analytic is to look for wmi commandlines to execute or create process.
  This technique was used by adversaries or threat actor to execute their malicious
  payload in local or remote host. This hunting query is a good pivot to start to
  look further which process trigger the wmi or what process it execute locally or
  remotely.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` Processes.process
  = "* process *" Processes.process = "* call *" Processes.process = "* create *"
  by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_path
  Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_id Processes.dest Processes.user

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_wmi_process_call_create_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may execute this command for testing or auditing.
