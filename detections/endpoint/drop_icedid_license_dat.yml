description: The following analytic detects the dropping of a suspicious file named
  "license.dat" in %appdata% or %programdata%. This behavior is associated with the
  IcedID malware, which uses this file to inject its core bot into other processes
  for banking credential theft. The detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 11 to monitor
  file creation events in these directories. This activity is significant as it indicates
  a potential malware infection aiming to steal sensitive banking information. If
  confirmed malicious, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to financial data,
  leading to significant financial loss and data breaches.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '`sysmon` EventCode= 11  TargetFilename = "*\\license.dat" AND (TargetFilename="*\\appdata\\*"
  OR TargetFilename="*\\programdata\\*") |stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by TargetFilename EventCode process_id  process_name dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_icedid_license_dat_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
