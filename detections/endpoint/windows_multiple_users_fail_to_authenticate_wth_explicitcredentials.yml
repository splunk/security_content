description: 'The following analytic identifies a source user failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique users using explicit credentials on a host. This behavior could represent
  an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment
  to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Active Directory environments can
  be very different depending on the organization. Users should test this detection
  and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed. Event 4648 is generated when
  a process attempts an account logon by explicitly specifying that accounts credentials.
  This event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations.

  This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting
  exercises. This detection will trigger on the potenfially malicious host, perhaps
  controlled via a trojan or operated by an insider threat, from where a password
  spraying attack is being executed.

  The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by
  providing fields like source account, attempted user accounts and the endpoint were
  the behavior was identified.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A source user failing attempting to authenticate multiple users
  on a host is not a common behavior for regular systems. Some applications, however,
  may exhibit this behavior in which case sets of users hosts can be added to an allow
  list. Possible false positive scenarios include systems where several users connect
  to like Mail servers, identity providers, remote desktop services, Citrix, etc.
