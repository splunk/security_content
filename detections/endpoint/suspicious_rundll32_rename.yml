datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of rundll32.exe executing.
  rundll32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. During
  investigation, validate it is the legitimate rundll32.exe executing and what script
  content it is loading. This query relies on the original filename or internal name
  from the PE meta data. Expand the query as needed by looking for specific command
  line arguments outlined in other analytics.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_rundll32_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of rundll32, triggering a false positive.
