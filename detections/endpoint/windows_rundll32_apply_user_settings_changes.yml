description: The following analytic detects the execution of a suspicious rundll32
  command line that updates user-specific system parameters, such as desktop backgrounds,
  display settings, and visual themes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving "user32.dll,UpdatePerUserSystemParameters."
  This activity is significant as it is uncommon for legitimate purposes and has been
  observed in Rhysida Ransomware for defense evasion. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow an attacker to disguise activities or make unauthorized system changes,
  potentially leading to persistent unauthorized access.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=rundll32.exe
  Processes.process= "*user32.dll,UpdatePerUserSystemParameters*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_rundll32_apply_user_settings_changes_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
