description: The following analytic detects the execution of a suspicious rundll32 command line that updates user-specific system parameters, such as desktop backgrounds, display settings, and visual themes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving "user32.dll,UpdatePerUserSystemParameters." This activity is significant as it is uncommon for legitimate purposes and has been observed in Rhysida Ransomware for defense evasion. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to disguise activities or make unauthorized system changes, potentially leading to persistent unauthorized access.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
