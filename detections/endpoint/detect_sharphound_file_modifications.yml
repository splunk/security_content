description: SharpHound is used as a reconnaissance collector, ingestor, for BloodHound.
  SharpHound will query the domain controller and begin gathering all the data related
  to the domain and trusts. For output, it will drop a .zip file upon completion following
  a typical pattern that is often not changed. This analytic focuses on the default
  file name scheme. Note that this may be evaded with different parameters within
  SharpHound, but that depends on the operator. `-randomizefilenames` and `-encryptzip`
  are two examples. In addition, executing SharpHound via .exe or .ps1 without any
  command-line arguments will still perform activity and dump output to the default
  filename. Example default filename `20210601181553_BloodHound.zip`. SharpHound creates
  multiple temp files following the same pattern `20210601182121_computers.json`,
  `domains.json`, `gpos.json`, `ous.json` and `users.json`. Tuning may be required,
  or remove these json's entirely if it is too noisy. During traige, review parallel
  processes for further suspicious behavior. Typically, the process executing the
  `.ps1` ingestor will be PowerShell.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_name IN ("*bloodhound.zip",
  "*_computers.json", "*_gpos.json", "*_domains.json", "*_users.json", "*_groups.json")
  by Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.process_id  Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path
  Filesystem.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_sharphound_file_modifications_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on file modifications that include the name of the process, and file, responsible
  for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem`
  node.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as the analytic is specific
  to a filename with extension .zip. Filter as needed.
