description: The following analytic detects the creation of files typically associated
  with SharpHound, a reconnaissance tool used for gathering domain and trust data.
  It leverages file modification events from the Endpoint.Filesystem data model, focusing
  on default file naming patterns like `*_BloodHound.zip` and various JSON files.
  This activity is significant as it indicates potential domain enumeration, which
  is a precursor to more targeted attacks. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could
  gain detailed insights into the domain structure, facilitating lateral movement
  and privilege escalation.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_name IN ("*bloodhound.zip",
  "*_computers.json", "*_gpos.json", "*_domains.json", "*_users.json", "*_groups.json",
  "*_ous.json", "*_containers.json") by Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.process_id  Filesystem.file_name
  Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.dest Filesystem.user| `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_sharphound_file_modifications_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on file modifications that include the name of the process, and file, responsible
  for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem`
  node.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as the analytic is specific
  to a filename with extension .zip. Filter as needed.
