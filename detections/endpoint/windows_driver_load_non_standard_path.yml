description:
  The following analytic uses Windows EventCode 7045 to identify new Kernel
  Mode Drivers being loaded in Windows from a non-standard path. Note that, adversaries
  may move malicious or vulnerable drivers into these paths and load up. The idea
  is that this analytic provides visibility into drivers loading in non-standard file
  paths.
data_source:
  - Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ServiceType="kernel mode driver" NOT (ImagePath IN ("*\\Windows\\*", "*\\Program File*", "*\\systemroot\\*","%SystemRoot%*", "system32\*"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode ImagePath ServiceName ServiceType | rename Computer as dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_driver_load_non_standard_path_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To implement this analytic, the Windows EventCode 7045 will need
  to be logged. The Windows TA for Splunk is also recommended.
known_false_positives:
  False positives may be present based on legitimate third party
  applications needing to install drivers. Filter, or allow list known good drivers
  consistently being installed in these paths.
