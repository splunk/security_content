description: The following analytic uses Windows EventCode 7045 to identify new Kernel Mode Drivers being loaded in Windows from a non-standard path.
  Note that, adversaries may move malicious or vulnerable drivers into these paths and load up. The idea is that this analytic provides visibility into drivers loading in non-standard file paths.
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 Service_Type="kernel mode driver" NOT (Service_File_Name IN ("*\\Windows\\*", "*\\Program File*", "*\\systemroot\\*","%SystemRoot%*", "system32\*")) 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName EventCode Service_File_Name Service_Name Service_Start_Type Service_Type 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_driver_load_non_standard_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, the Windows EventCode 7045 will need to be logged. The Windows TA for Splunk is also recommended.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on legitimate third party applications needing to install drivers. Filter, or allow list known good drivers consistently being installed in these paths.
