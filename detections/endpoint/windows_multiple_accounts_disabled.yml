description: This Splunk detection focuses on instances where more than five unique Windows accounts are disabled within a 10-minute window, as indicated by Event Code 4725 in the Windows Security Event Log. The query analyzes the wineventlog_security dataset, grouping data into 10-minute segments, and tracks the count and distinct count of TargetUserName, the accounts being disabled. This pattern of disabling multiple accounts rapidly is unusual and could signal internal policy breaches or an external attacker's attempt to disrupt normal operations. Teams are advised to tailor the threshold and timeframe of this detection to their environment's specifics
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4725 status=success
  | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats count dc(user) as unique_users values(user) as user by EventCode signature _time src_user SubjectDomainName TargetDomainName Logon_ID
  | where unique_users > 5
  | `windows_multiple_accounts_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events with the Windows TA. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit User Account Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Service accounts may be responsible for the creation, deletion or modification of accounts for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
