description: The following analytic detects a suspicious mshta.exe process spawning
  rundll32 or regsvr32 child processes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process GUID, process name, and parent process
  fields. This activity is significant as it is a known technique used by malware
  like Trickbot to load malicious DLLs and execute payloads. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges,
  or download additional malware, posing a severe threat to the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  = "mshta.exe"  `process_rundll32` OR `process_regsvr32` by  Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid Processes.user Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `mshta_spawning_rundll32_or_regsvr32_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: limitted. this anomaly behavior is not commonly seen in clean
  host.
