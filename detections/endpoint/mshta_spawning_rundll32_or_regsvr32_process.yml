datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious mshta.exe process that spawn rundll32
  or regsvr32 child process. This technique was seen in several malware nowadays like
  trickbot to load its initial .dll stage loader to execute and download the the actual
  trickbot payload.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  = "mshta.exe"  `process_rundll32` OR `process_regsvr32` by Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid
  Processes.user Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `mshta_spawning_rundll32_or_regsvr32_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: limitted. this anomaly behavior is not commonly seen in clean
  host.
