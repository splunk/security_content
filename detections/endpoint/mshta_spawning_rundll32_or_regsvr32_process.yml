description: This search is to detect a suspicious mshta.exe process that spawn rundll32
  or regsvr32 child process. This technique was seen in several malware nowadays like
  trickbot to load its initial .dll stage loader to execute and download the the actual
  trickbot payload.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  = "mshta.exe"  (Processes.process_name=rundll32.exe OR Processes.process_name=regsvr32.exe)
  by Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid Processes.user Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `mshta_spawning_rundll32_or_regsvr32_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed mshta.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: limitted. this anomaly behavior is not commonly seen in clean
  host.
