description: This analytic is designed to detect potentially suspicious batch files that leverage choice.exe as a delay tactic. 
  This technique, observed in the SnakeKeylogger malware, is utilized for time delays or 'Sleep' commands in its code execution 
  or before the deletion of its copies on compromised hosts. Detecting this anomaly serves as a valuable pivot to uncover 
  suspicious processes attempting to evade detection through time-based evasion techniques.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrator may use choice.exe to allow user to choose from and indexes of choices from a batch
  script.
