description: The following analytic detects the use of choice.exe in batch files as a delay tactic, a technique observed in SnakeKeylogger malware. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential time-based evasion techniques used by malware to avoid detection. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute code stealthily, delete malicious files, and persist on compromised hosts, making it crucial for SOC analysts to investigate promptly.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name =choice.exe  Processes.process = "*/T*"  Processes.process = "*/N*" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_time_based_evasion_via_choice_exec_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrator may use choice.exe to allow user to choose from and indexes of choices from a batch script.
