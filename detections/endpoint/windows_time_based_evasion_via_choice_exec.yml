description: The following analytic detects the use of choice.exe in batch files as
  a delay tactic, a technique observed in SnakeKeylogger malware. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and
  command-line executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
  time-based evasion techniques used by malware to avoid detection. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to execute code stealthily, delete malicious
  files, and persist on compromised hosts, making it crucial for SOC analysts to investigate
  promptly.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name =choice.exe  Processes.process
  = "*/T*"  Processes.process = "*/N*" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_time_based_evasion_via_choice_exec_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrator may use choice.exe to allow user to choose from
  and indexes of choices from a batch script.
