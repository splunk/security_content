description: The following analytic detects the execution of `whoami.exe` with the
  `/priv` parameter, which displays the privileges assigned to the current user account.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an adversary attempting to enumerate user privileges, a common step in
  the reconnaissance phase of an attack. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  privilege escalation or further exploitation within the environment.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="whoami.exe"
  Processes.process= "*/priv*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_system_user_privilege_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
  Filter as needed.
