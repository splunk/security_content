description: 'The following analytic identifies the creation of suspicious .aspx files
  in specific directories associated with Exchange exploitation by the HAFNIUM group
  and the ProxyShell vulnerability. It detects this activity by monitoring the MSExchangeMailboxReplication.exe
  process, which typically does not write .aspx files. This behavior is significant
  as it may indicate an active exploitation attempt on Exchange servers. If confirmed
  malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or
  maintain persistence within the environment. Immediate investigation and remediation
  are crucial to prevent further compromise.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node and `Filesystem`
  node.
known_false_positives: The query is structured in a way that `action` (read, create)
  is not defined. Review the results of this query, filter, and tune as necessary.
  It may be necessary to generate this query specific to your endpoint product.
