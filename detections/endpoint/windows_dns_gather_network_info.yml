description: The following analytic identifies a process command line used to enumerate
  DNS records. Adversaries, threat actors, or red teamers may employ this technique
  to gather information about a victim's DNS, which can be utilized during targeting.
  This method was also observed as part of a tool used by the Sandworm APT group in
  a geopolitical cyber warfare attack. By using the dnscmd.exe Windows application,
  an attacker can enumerate DNS records for specific domains within the targeted network,
  potentially aiding in further attacks. This anomaly detection can serve as a valuable
  starting point for identifying users and hostnames that may be compromised or targeted
  by adversaries seeking to collect data information.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "dnscmd.exe"
  Processes.process = "* /enumrecords *" by Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process Processes.user Processes.dest
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_dns_gather_network_info_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can execute this command to enumerate
  DNS record. Filter or add other paths to the exclusion as needed.
