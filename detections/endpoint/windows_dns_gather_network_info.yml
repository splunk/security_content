description: The following analytic identifies a process command line used to enumerate DNS records. Adversaries, threat actors, or red teamers may employ this technique to gather information about a victim's DNS, which can be utilized during targeting. This method was also observed as part of a tool used by the Sandworm APT group in a geopolitical cyber warfare attack. By using the dnscmd.exe Windows application, an attacker can enumerate DNS records for specific domains within the targeted network, potentially aiding in further attacks. This anomaly detection can serve as a valuable starting point for identifying users and hostnames that may be compromised or targeted by adversaries seeking to collect data information.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name = "dnscmd.exe" Processes.process = "* /enumrecords *"
  by Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process Processes.user Processes.dest
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_dns_gather_network_info_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process 
  that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` 
  datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and 
  the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: network administrator can execute this command to enumerate DNS record. Filter or add other paths to the exclusion as needed.
