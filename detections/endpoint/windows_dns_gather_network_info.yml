description: The following analytic detects the use of the dnscmd.exe command to enumerate DNS records. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary gathering network information, a common precursor to more targeted attacks. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could enable attackers to map the network, identify critical assets, and plan subsequent actions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further compromise of the network.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "dnscmd.exe" Processes.process = "* /enumrecords *" by Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process Processes.user Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_dns_gather_network_info_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can execute this command to enumerate DNS record. Filter or add other paths to the exclusion as needed.
