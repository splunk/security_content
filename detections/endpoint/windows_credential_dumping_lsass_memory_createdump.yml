description: The following analytic detects the use of CreateDump.exe to perform a
  process dump. This binary is not native to Windows and is often introduced by third-party
  applications, including PowerShell 7. The detection leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, GUIDs, and complete
  command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt
  to dump LSASS memory, which can be used to extract credentials. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if an application is dumping
  processes, filter as needed. Recommend reviewing createdump.exe usage across the
  fleet to better understand all usage and by what.
