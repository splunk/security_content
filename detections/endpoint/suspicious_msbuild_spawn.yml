description: The following analytic identifies wmiprvse.exe spawning msbuild.exe.
  This behavior is indicative of a COM object being utilized to spawn msbuild from
  wmiprvse.exe. It is common for MSBuild.exe to be spawned from devenv.exe while using
  Visual Studio. In this instance, there will be command line arguments and file paths.
  In a malicious instance, MSBuild.exe will spawn from non-standard processes and
  have no command line arguments. For example, MSBuild.exe spawning from explorer.exe,
  powershell.exe is far less common and should be investigated.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=wmiprvse.exe
  AND `process_msbuild` by Processes.dest Processes.parent_process Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_msbuild_spawn_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
