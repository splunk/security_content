description: The following analytic identifies instances where wmiprvse.exe spawns
  msbuild.exe, which is unusual and indicative of potential misuse of a COM object.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process relationships and command-line executions. This activity is
  significant because msbuild.exe is typically spawned by devenv.exe during legitimate
  Visual Studio use, not by wmiprvse.exe. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
  indicate an attacker executing arbitrary code or scripts, potentially leading to
  system compromise or further malicious activities.

- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=wmiprvse.exe
  AND `process_msbuild` by Processes.dest Processes.parent_process Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_msbuild_spawn_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
