- Endpoint
description: The following detection identifies rundll32.exe with `control_rundll`
  within the command-line, loading a .cpl or another file type from windows\temp,
  programdata, or appdata. Developed in relation to CVE-2021-40444. Rundll32.exe can
  also be used to execute Control Panel Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented
  shell32.dll functions Control_RunDLL and Control_RunDLLAsUser. Double-clicking a
  .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. This is written to be a bit more
  broad by not including .cpl. The paths are specified, add more as needed. During
  triage, review parallel processes to identify any further suspicious behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` Processes.process=*Control_RunDLL*
  AND Processes.process IN ("*\\appdata\\*", "*\\windows\\temp\\*", "*\\programdata\\*")  by
  Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `rundll32_control_rundll_world_writable_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: This may be tuned, or a new one related, by adding .cpl to
  command-line. However, it's important to look for both. Tune/filter as needed.
