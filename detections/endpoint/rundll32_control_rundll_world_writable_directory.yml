description: The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe with the `Control_RunDLL` command, loading files from world-writable directories such as windows\temp, programdata, or appdata. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process command-line data and specific directory paths. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to exploit CVE-2021-40444 or similar vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This may be tuned, or a new one related, by adding .cpl to command-line. However, it's important to look for both. Tune/filter as needed.
