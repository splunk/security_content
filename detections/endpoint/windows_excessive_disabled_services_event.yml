description: This analytic will identify suspicious excessive number of system events
  of services that was modified from start to disabled. This technique is seen where
  the adversary attempts to disable security app services, other malware services
  oer serve as an destructive impact to complete the objective on the compromised
  system. One good example for this scenario is Olympic destroyer where it disable
  all active services in the compromised host as part of its destructive impact and
  defense evasion.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7040 "disabled" | stats count values(EventData_Xml) as MessageList dc(EventData_Xml) as MessageCount min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode UserID | rename Computer as dest
  | where count >=10 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_excessive_disabled_services_event_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
