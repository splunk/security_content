description: This analytic will identify suspicious excessive number of system events of services that was modified from start to disabled. 
  This technique is seen where the adversary attempts to disable security app services, other malware services oer serve as an destructive impact
  to complete the objective on the compromised system. One good example for this scenario is Olympic destroyer where it disable all active services 
  in the compromised host as part of its destructive impact and defense evasion.
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7040 Message = "*service was changed from demand start to disabled." 
  | stats count values(Message) as MessageList dc(Message) as MessageCount min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName EventCode  User Sid
  | where MessageCount >=10
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_excessive_disabled_services_event_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
