description: The following analytic identifies an excessive number of system events
  where services are modified from start to disabled. It leverages Windows Event Logs
  (EventCode 7040) to detect multiple service state changes on a single host. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to disable security
  applications or other critical services, potentially leading to defense evasion
  or destructive actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
  to disable security defenses, disrupt system operations, and achieve their objectives
  on the compromised system.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log System 7040
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7040 "disabled" | stats count values(EventData_Xml)
  as MessageList dc(EventData_Xml) as MessageCount min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by Computer EventCode UserID | rename Computer as dest | where count
  >=10 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_excessive_disabled_services_event_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
