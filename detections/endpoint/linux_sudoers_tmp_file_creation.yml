datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to looks for file creation of sudoers.tmp file cause
  by editing /etc/sudoers using visudo or editor in linux platform. This technique
  may abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain elevated privilege
  to targeted or compromised host. /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what commands
  as what users on what machines and can also control special things such as whether
  you need a password for particular commands. The file is composed of aliases (basically
  variables) and user specifications (which control who can run what).
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*sudoers.tmp*")
  by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.file_path
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `linux_sudoers_tmp_file_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
