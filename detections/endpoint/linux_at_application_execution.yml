description: 'The following analytic detects the execution of the "At" application
  in Linux, which can be used by attackers to create persistence entries on a compromised
  host. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and parent process names associated with "at" or "atd".
  This activity is significant because the "At" application can be exploited to maintain
  unauthorized access or deliver additional malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could lead to data theft, ransomware attacks, or other severe consequences.
  Immediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of the execution
  and mitigate potential risks.'
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where  Processes.process_name IN ("at", "atd") OR Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("at", "atd") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_at_application_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
