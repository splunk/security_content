description: 'The following hunting analytic identifies `msi.dll` being loaded by
  a binary not located in `system32`, `syswow64`, `winsxs` or `windows` paths. This
  behavior is most recently related to InstallerFileTakeOver, or CVE-2021-41379, and
  DLL side-loading. CVE-2021-41379 requires a binary to be dropped and `msi.dll` to
  be loaded by it. To Successful exploitation of this issue happens in four parts
  \

  1. Generation of an MSI that will trigger bad behavior. \

  1. Preparing a directory for MSI installation. \

  1. Inducing an error state. \

  1. Racing to introduce a junction and a symlink to trick msiexec.exe to modify the
  attacker specified file. \

  In addition, `msi.dll` has been abused in DLL side-loading attacks by being loaded
  by non-system binaries.'
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 ImageLoaded="*\\msi.dll" NOT (Image IN ("*\\System32\\*","*\\syswow64\\*","*\\windows\\*",
  "*\\winsxs\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by
  Image ImageLoaded process_name Computer EventCode ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `msi_module_loaded_by_non_system_binary_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: It is possible some Administrative utilities will load msi.dll
  outside of normal system paths, filter as needed.
