description: The following analytic detects a suspicious `rundll32.exe` command line used to execute a DLL file, a technique associated with IcedID malware. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions containing the pattern `*/i:*`. This activity is significant as it indicates potential malware attempting to load an encrypted DLL payload, often named `license.dat`. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, leading to further system compromise and potential data exfiltration.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: limitted. this parameter is not commonly used by windows application but can be used by the network operator.
