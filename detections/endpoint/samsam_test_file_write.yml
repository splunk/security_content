description: The search looks for a file named "test.txt" written to the windows system
  directory tree, which is consistent with Samsam propagation.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the file-system activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data-model node. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
