description: The following analytic detects the creation of a file named "test.txt"
  within the Windows system directory, indicative of Samsam ransomware propagation.
  It leverages file-system activity data from the Endpoint data model, specifically
  monitoring file paths within the Windows System32 directory. This activity is significant
  as it aligns with known Samsam ransomware behavior, which uses such files for propagation
  and execution. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to ransomware deployment,
  resulting in data encryption, system disruption, and potential data loss. Immediate
  investigation and remediation are crucial to prevent further damage.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the file-system activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data-model node. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
known_false_positives: No false positives have been identified.
