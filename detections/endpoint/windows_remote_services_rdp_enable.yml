description: The following analytic detects modifications in the Windows registry
  to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on a targeted machine. It leverages data
  from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to the "fDenyTSConnections"
  registry value. This activity is significant as enabling RDP via registry is uncommon
  and often associated with adversaries or malware attempting to gain remote access.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to remotely control the compromised
  host, potentially leading to further exploitation and lateral movement within the
  network.

- Sysmon EventID 12

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Control\\Terminal
  Server\\fDenyTSConnections*" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000000" by Registry.registry_key_name

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_services_rdp_enable_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
