description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for admin weak password policy violations, 
  identifying instances where administrative passwords do not meet security standards. 
  These alerts highlight significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access. 
  Promptly addressing these alerts is crucial for maintaining robust security and protecting critical systems and data from potential threats.

how_to_implement: To implement crowdstrike:identities logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, 
  authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "crowdstrike:identities" event stream. 
  Process and store the logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.
