description: The following analytic detects a suspicious computer account name change
  in Active Directory. It leverages Event ID 4781, which logs account name changes,
  to identify instances where a computer account name is changed to one that does
  not end with a `$`. This behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to
  exploit CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287, which can lead to domain controller impersonation
  and privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker
  to gain elevated privileges and potentially control the domain.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4781
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4781 OldTargetUserName="*$" NewTargetUserName!="*$"
  | table _time, Computer, Caller_User_Name, OldTargetUserName, NewTargetUserName
  | rename Computer as dest | `suspicious_computer_account_name_change_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows event logs from your hosts. In addition, the Splunk Windows TA is needed.
known_false_positives: Renaming a computer account name to a name that not end with
  '$' is highly unsual and may not have any legitimate scenarios.
