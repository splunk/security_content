description: As part of the sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller
  Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287) exploitation chain, adversaries need to create a
  new computer account name and rename it to match the name of a domain controller
  account without the ending '$'. In Windows Active Directory environments, computer
  account names always end with `$`. This analytic leverages Event Id 4781, `The name
  of an account was changed`, to identify a computer account rename event with a suspicious
  name that does not terminate with `$`. This behavior could represent an exploitation
  attempt of CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 for privilege escalation.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4781 Old_Account_Name="*$" New_Account_Name!="*$"
  | table _time, ComputerName, Account_Name, Old_Account_Name, New_Account_Name |
  `suspicious_computer_account_name_change_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows event logs from your hosts. In addition, the Splunk Windows TA is needed.
known_false_positives: Renaming a computer account name to a name that not end with
  '$' is highly unsual and may not have any legitimate scenarios.
