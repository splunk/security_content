description: The following analytic detects a suspicious computer account name change in Active Directory. It leverages Event ID 4781, which logs account name changes, to identify instances where a computer account name is changed to one that does not end with a `$`. This behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to exploit CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287, which can lead to domain controller impersonation and privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges and potentially control the domain.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4781
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4781 OldTargetUserName="*$" NewTargetUserName!="*$" | table _time, Computer, Caller_User_Name, OldTargetUserName, NewTargetUserName | rename Computer as dest | `suspicious_computer_account_name_change_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows event logs from your hosts. In addition, the Splunk Windows TA is needed.
known_false_positives: Renaming a computer account name to a name that not end with '$' is highly unsual and may not have any legitimate scenarios.
