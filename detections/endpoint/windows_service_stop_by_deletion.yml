description: The following analytic detects the use of `sc.exe` to delete a Windows service. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process execution logs that capture command-line arguments. This activity is significant because adversaries often delete services to disable security mechanisms or critical system functions, aiding in evasion and persistence. If confirmed malicious, this action could lead to the termination of essential security services, allowing attackers to operate undetected and potentially escalate their privileges or maintain long-term access to the compromised system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible administrative scripts may start/stop/delete services. Filter as needed.
