datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies Windows Service Control, `sc.exe`,
  attempting to delete a service. This is typically identified in parallel with other
  instances of service enumeration of attempts to stop a service and then delete it.
  Adversaries utilize this technique to terminate security services or other related
  services to continue there objective and evade detections.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name = sc.exe OR Processes.original_file_name = sc.exe)
  Processes.process="* delete *" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_stop_by_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: It is possible administrative scripts may start/stop/delete
  services. Filter as needed.
