description: The following analytic detects the disabling of Windows Defender logging
  by identifying changes to the Registry keys DefenderApiLogger or DefenderAuditLogger
  set to disable. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel to monitor
  specific registry paths and values. This activity is significant as it is commonly
  associated with Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware attempting to evade detection.
  If confirmed malicious, this action could allow an attacker to conceal their activities,
  making it harder to detect further malicious actions and maintain persistence on
  the compromised endpoint.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 12 
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where (Registry.registry_path = "*WMI\\Autologger\\DefenderApiLogger\\Start"
  OR Registry.registry_path = "*WMI\\Autologger\\DefenderAuditLogger\\Start")  Registry.registry_value_data
  ="0x00000000" by  Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.process_guid Registry.action Registry.dest Registry.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defenses_disable_win_defender_auto_logging_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
