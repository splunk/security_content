description: This analytic identifies potentially malicious 'ImageLoaded' events, particularly when they involve executable files. 
  This behavior was observed in NjRAT instances, where, during each instance of loading a module from its C2 server onto the compromised host, 
  Sysmon recorded the path of the actual Image or Process as an 'ImageLoaded' event, rather than the typical tracking of dynamically loaded DLL modules in memory.
  This event holds significance because it tracks processes that load modules and libraries, which are typically in the .dll format rather than .exe. 
  Leveraging this 'Time-To-Perform' (TTP) detection method can prove invaluable for the identification of NjRAT malware or 
  other malicious software instances that introduce executable files as modules within a targeted host.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. 
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
