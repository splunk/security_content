description: The search looks for files created with names matching those typically
  used in ransomware notes that tell the victim how to get their data back.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(Filesystem.user) as user values(Filesystem.dest) as dest values(Filesystem.file_path)
  as file_path from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem by Filesystem.file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `ransomware_notes`
  | `common_ransomware_notes_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records file-system activity from
  your hosts to populate the Endpoint Filesystem data-model node. This is typically
  populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black, or
  via other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is
  typically generated via logs that report file-system reads and writes.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a legitimate file could be created with
  the same name used by ransomware note files.
