description: The following analytic detects the creation of files with names commonly
  associated with ransomware notes. It leverages file-system activity data from the
  Endpoint Filesystem data model, typically populated by endpoint detection and response
  (EDR) tools or Sysmon logs. This activity is significant because ransomware notes
  indicate a potential ransomware attack, which can lead to data encryption and extortion.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could result in significant data loss, operational
  disruption, and financial impact due to ransom demands.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(Filesystem.user) as user values(Filesystem.dest) as dest values(Filesystem.file_path)
  as file_path from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem by Filesystem.file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `ransomware_notes`
  | `common_ransomware_notes_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records file-system activity from
  your hosts to populate the Endpoint Filesystem data-model node. This is typically
  populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black, or
  via other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is
  typically generated via logs that report file-system reads and writes.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a legitimate file could be created with
  the same name used by ransomware note files.
