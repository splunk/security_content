description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of msbuild.exe executing.
  Msbuild.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 and
  C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319. During investigation, identify
  the code executed and what is executing a renamed instance of MSBuild.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name!=msbuild.exe
  AND Processes.original_file_name=MSBuild.exe by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.original_file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_msbuild_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of msbuild, triggering a false positive.
