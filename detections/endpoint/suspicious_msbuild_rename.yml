- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of msbuild.exe executing.
  Msbuild.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 and
  C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319. During investigation, identify
  the code executed and what is executing a renamed instance of MSBuild.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_msbuild` by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_msbuild_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of msbuild, triggering a false positive.
