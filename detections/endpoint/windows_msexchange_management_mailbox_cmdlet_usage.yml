description: The following analytic identifies suspicious Cmdlet usage in Exchange
  Management logs, focusing on commands like New-MailboxExportRequest and New-ManagementRoleAssignment.
  It leverages EventCode 1 and specific Message patterns to detect potential ProxyShell
  and ProxyNotShell abuse. This activity is significant as it may indicate unauthorized
  access or manipulation of mailboxes and roles, which are critical for maintaining
  email security. If confirmed malicious, attackers could export mailbox data, assign
  new roles, or search mailboxes, leading to data breaches and privilege escalation.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '`msexchange_management` EventCode=1 Message IN ("*New-MailboxExportRequest*",
  "*New-ManagementRoleAssignment*", "*New-MailboxSearch*", "*Get-Recipient*", "*Search-Mailbox*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by host Message | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | rename host AS dest | `windows_msexchange_management_mailbox_cmdlet_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic requires collecting the Exchange Management
  logs via a input. An example inputs is here https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/f66f1d608ea046efb9157020cd34c178.
  We used multiline as the XML format of the logs will require props/transforms. Multiline
  gives us everything we need in Message for now. Update the macro with your correct
  sourcetype.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present when an Administrator utilizes
  the cmdlets in the query. Filter or monitor as needed.
