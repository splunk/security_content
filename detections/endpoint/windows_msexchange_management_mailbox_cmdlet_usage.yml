description: The following analytic uses the Exchange Management logs, that are enabled
  by default, to identify suspicious Cmdlet usage related to ProxyShell and ProxyNotShell
  abuse.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '`msexchange_management` EventCode=1 Message IN ("*New-MailboxExportRequest*",
  "*New-ManagementRoleAssignment*", "*New-MailboxSearch*", "*Get-Recipient*", "*Search-Mailbox*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by host Message | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | rename host AS dest | `windows_msexchange_management_mailbox_cmdlet_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic requires collecting the Exchange Management
  logs via a input. An example inputs is here https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/f66f1d608ea046efb9157020cd34c178.
  We used multiline as the XML format of the logs will require props/transforms. Multiline
  gives us everything we need in Message for now. Update the macro with your correct
  sourcetype.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present when an Administrator utilizes
  the cmdlets in the query. Filter or monitor as needed.
