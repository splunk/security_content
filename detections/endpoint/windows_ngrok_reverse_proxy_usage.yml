description: The following analytic identifies the use of ngrok.exe being utilized
  on the Windows operating system. Unfortunately, there is no original file name for
  Ngrok, so it may be worth an additional hunt to identify any command-line arguments.
  The sign of someone using Ngrok is not malicious, however, more recently it has
  become an adversary tool.

- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=ngrok.exe
  Processes.process IN ("*start*", "*--config*","*http*","*authtoken*", "*http*",
  "*tcp*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on organizations that
  allow the use of Ngrok. Filter or monitor as needed.
