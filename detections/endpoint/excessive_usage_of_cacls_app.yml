description: The following analytic identifies excessive usage of `cacls.exe`, `xcacls.exe`,
  or `icacls.exe` to change file or folder permissions. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting
  to restrict access to malware components or artifacts on a compromised system. If
  confirmed malicious, this behavior could prevent users from deleting or accessing
  critical files, aiding in the persistence and concealment of malicious activities.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id  values(Processes.process_name) as process_name
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name = "cacls.exe" OR Processes.process_name = "icacls.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "XCACLS.exe" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
