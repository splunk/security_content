- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies excessive usage of `cacls.exe`, `xcacls.exe`
  or `icacls.exe` application to change file or folder permission. This behavior is
  commonly seen where the adversary attempts to impair some users from deleting or
  accessing its malware components or artifact from the compromised system.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id  values(Processes.process_name) as process_name
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name = "cacls.exe" OR Processes.process_name = "icacls.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "XCACLS.exe" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.dest Processes.user _time span=1m | where count >=10 | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_usage_of_cacls_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
