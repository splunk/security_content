description: The following analytic detects the extraction of authentication certificates
  using Windows Event Log - CAPI2 (CryptoAPI 2). It leverages EventID 70, which is
  generated when a certificate's private key is acquired. This detection is significant
  because it can identify potential misuse of certificates, such as those extracted
  by tools like Mimikatz or Cobalt Strike. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  allow attackers to impersonate users, escalate privileges, or access sensitive information,
  posing a severe risk to the organization's security.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log CAPI2 70
search: '`capi2_operational` EventCode=70 | xmlkv UserData_Xml | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, UserData_Xml | rename Computer
  as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_steal_authentication_certificates_cryptoapi_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, one will need to enable the Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational
  log within the Windows Event Log. Note this is a debug log for many purposes, and
  the analytic only focuses in on EventID 70. Review the following gist for additional
  enabling information.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present in some instances of legitimate
  applications requiring to export certificates. Filter as needed.
