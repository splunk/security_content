description: The following analytic utilizes a Windows Event Log - CAPI2 - or CryptoAPI 2, to identify suspicious certificate extraction. Typically, this event log is meant for diagnosing PKI issues, however is a great source to identify certificate exports. 
  Note that this event log is noisy as it captures common PKI requests from many different processes. EventID 70 is generated anytime a certificate is exported. The description for EventID 70 is "Acquire Certificate Private Key".
  STRT tested this analytic using Mimikatz binary and the implementation of Mimikatz in Cobalt Strike.

how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, one will need to enable the Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational log within the Windows Event Log. Note this is a debug log for many purposes, and the analytic only focuses in on EventID 70. Review the following gist for additional enabling information.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present in some instances of legitimate applications requiring to export certificates. Filter as needed.
