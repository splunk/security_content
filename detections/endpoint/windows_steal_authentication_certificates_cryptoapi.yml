description: The following analytic utilizes a Windows Event Log - CAPI2 - or CryptoAPI
  2, to identify suspicious certificate extraction. Typically, this event log is meant
  for diagnosing PKI issues, however is a great source to identify certificate exports.
  Note that this event log is noisy as it captures common PKI requests from many different
  processes. EventID 70 is generated anytime a certificate is exported. The description
  for EventID 70 is "Acquire Certificate Private Key". STRT tested this analytic using
  Mimikatz binary and the implementation of Mimikatz in Cobalt Strike.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`capi2_operational` EventCode=70 | xmlkv UserData_Xml | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, UserData_Xml | rename Computer
  as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_steal_authentication_certificates_cryptoapi_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, one will need to enable the Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational
  log within the Windows Event Log. Note this is a debug log for many purposes, and
  the analytic only focuses in on EventID 70. Review the following gist for additional
  enabling information.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present in some instances of legitimate
  applications requiring to export certificates. Filter as needed.
