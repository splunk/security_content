description: this detection was designed to identifies suspicious spawned process
  of known MS office application due to macro or malicious code. this technique can
  be seen in so many malware like trickbot that used MS office as its weapon or attack
  vector to initially infect the machines.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.parent_process_name = "winword.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name
  = "excel.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name = "powerpnt.exe") Processes.process_name=rundll32.exe  by
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid

  | `office_application_spawn_rundll32_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
