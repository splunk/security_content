type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic is to look for known processes killed by industroyer2 malware. 
  This technique was seen in the industroyer2 malware attack that tries to kill several processes 
  of windows host machines related to the energy facility network. This anomaly might be a good 
  indicator to check which process kill these processes or why the process was killed.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=5 process_name IN ("PServiceControl.exe", "PService_PPD.exe") 
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by process_name process process_path process_guid process_id EventCode dest user_id
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_processes_killed_by_industroyer2_malware_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate applications are
  allowed to terminate this process during testing or updates. Filter as needed based on paths that
  are used legitimately.
