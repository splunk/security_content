description: The following analytic detects the execution of a kworker process with
  a command line in writable directories such as /home/, /var/log, and /tmp on a Linux
  machine. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process and parent process paths. This activity is significant as kworker processes
  are typically kernel threads, and their presence in writable directories is unusual
  and indicative of potential malware, such as CyclopsBlink. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to blend malicious processes with legitimate ones, leading
  to persistent access and further system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
