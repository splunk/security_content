description: The following analytic detects the execution of `nltest.exe` with command-line
  arguments `/dclist:` or `/dsgetdc:` to discover domain controllers. It leverages
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process names and command-line
  arguments. This activity is significant because both Red Teams and adversaries use
  `nltest.exe` for situational awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to map out domain controllers, facilitating
  further attacks such as privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="nltest.exe")
  (Processes.process="*/dclist:*" OR Processes.process="*/dsgetdc:*") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `domain_controller_discovery_with_nltest_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
