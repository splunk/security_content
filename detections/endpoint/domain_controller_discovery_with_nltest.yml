description: This analytic looks for the execution of `nltest.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover remote systems. The arguments `/dclist:` and '/dsgetdc:',
  can be used to return a list of all domain controllers. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may use nltest.exe to identify domain controllers in a Windows Domain for
  situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="nltest.exe")
  (Processes.process="*/dclist:*" OR Processes.process="*/dsgetdc:*") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
