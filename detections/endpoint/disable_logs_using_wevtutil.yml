type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect execution of wevtutil.exe to disable logs. This
  technique was seen in several ransomware to disable the event logs to evade alerts
  and detections.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "wevtutil.exe"
  Processes.process = "*sl*" Processes.process = "*/e:false*" by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `disable_logs_using_wevtutil_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network operator may disable audit event logs for debugging
  purposes.
