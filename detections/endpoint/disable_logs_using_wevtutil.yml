description: The following analytic detects the execution of "wevtutil.exe" with parameters
  to disable event logs. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
  because disabling event logs is a common tactic used by ransomware to evade detection
  and hinder forensic investigations. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow
  attackers to operate undetected, making it difficult to trace their activities and
  respond effectively to the incident.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "wevtutil.exe"
  Processes.process = "*sl*" Processes.process = "*/e:false*" by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `disable_logs_using_wevtutil_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network operator may disable audit event logs for debugging
  purposes.
