description: The following analytic identifies instances where a Microsoft Office product spawns `mshta.exe`. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where the parent process is an Office application. This activity is significant because it is a common technique used by malware families like TA551 and IcedID to execute malicious scripts or payloads. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or further malware deployment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.
