description: The following analytic identifies instances where a Microsoft Office
  product spawns `mshta.exe`. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where the parent
  process is an Office application. This activity is significant because it is a common
  technique used by malware families like TA551 and IcedID to execute malicious scripts
  or payloads. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute
  arbitrary code, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or
  further malware deployment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("winword.exe","excel.exe","powerpnt.exe","mspub.exe","visio.exe", "onenote.exe","onenotem.exe",
  "msaccess.exe","Graph.exe","winproj.exe") `process_mshta` by Processes.dest Processes.user

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.
