- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies the use of `wmic.exe` using `delete`
  to remove a executable path. This is typically ran via a batch file during beginning
  stages of an adversary setting up for mining on an endpoint.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where   Processes.process_name =
  "wmic.exe" AND Processes.process="*process*" AND Processes.process="*executablepath*"
  AND Processes.process="*delete*" by  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `process_kill_base_on_file_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed wmic.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Unknown.
