type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies the use of `wmic.exe` using `delete`
  to remove a executable path. This is typically ran via a batch file during beginning
  stages of an adversary setting up for mining on an endpoint.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` AND Processes.process="*process*"
  AND Processes.process="*executablepath*" AND Processes.process="*delete*" by  Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.dest Processes.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `process_kill_base_on_file_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
