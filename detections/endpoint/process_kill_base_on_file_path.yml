description: The following analytic detects the use of `wmic.exe` with the `delete`
  command to remove an executable path. This detection leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent processes,
  and command-line executions. This activity is significant because it often indicates
  the initial stages of an adversary setting up malicious activities, such as cryptocurrency
  mining, on an endpoint. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker
  to disable security tools or other critical processes, facilitating further compromise
  and persistence within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
