name: SchCache Change By App Connect And Create ADSI Object
id: 991eb510-0fc6-11ec-82d3-acde48001122

author: Teoderick Contreras, Splunk
status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects an application attempting to connect and
  create an ADSI object to perform an LDAP query. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 11
  to identify changes in the Active Directory Schema cache files located in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SchCache
  or %systemroot%\SchCache. This activity is significant as it can indicate the presence
  of suspicious applications, such as ransomware, using ADSI object APIs for LDAP
  queries. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to gather sensitive
  directory information, potentially leading to further exploitation or lateral movement
  within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11  TargetFilename = "*\\Windows\\SchCache\\*" TargetFilename
  = "*.sch*" NOT (Image IN ("*\\Windows\\system32\\mmc.exe")) |stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image TargetFilename EventCode process_id  process_name
  dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `schcache_change_by_app_connect_and_create_adsi_object_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: normal application like mmc.exe and other ldap query tool may
  trigger this detections.
