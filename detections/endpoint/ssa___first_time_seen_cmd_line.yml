name: First time seen command line argument - SSA
id: fc0edc95-ff2b-48b0-9f6f-63da3789fd23
version: 2
date: '2021-2-1'
description: "This search looks for command-line arguments that use a `/c` parameter
  to execute a command that has not previously been seen. 
This is an implementation on SPL2 of the rule `First time seen command line argument` by @bpatel."
how_to_implement: "You must be populating the endpoint data model for SSA and specifically the process_name and the process fields"

eli5: "The subsearch returns all events where `cmd.exe` was used with a `/c` parameter
  in the command-line arguments to execute other commands/programs. It appends the
  historical data to those results in the lookup file. Next, it recalculates the `firstTime`
  and `lastTime` field for command-line execution and outputs this data to the lookup
  file to update the local cache. It returns only those events that have first been
  seen in the past one hour. This is combined with the main search to return the time,
  user, destination, process, parent process, and value of the command-line argument."
known_false_positives: "Legitimate programs can also use command-line arguments to
  execute. Please verify the command-line arguments to check what command/program
  is being executed. We recommend customizing the `first_time_seen_cmd_line_filter` macro to exclude legitimate parent_process_name"
