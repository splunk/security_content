description: This search looks for specific authentication events from the Windows
  Security Event logs to detect potential attempts using Pass-the-Hash technique.
how_to_implement: The test data is converted from Windows Security Event logs generated
  from Attach Range simulation and used in SPL search and extended to SPL2
type: SSA
references: [Initial ESCU implementation by Bhavin Patel and Patrick Bareiss]
