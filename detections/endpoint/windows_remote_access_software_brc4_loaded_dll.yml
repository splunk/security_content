description: The following analytic identifies the loading of four specific Windows
  DLLs (credui.dll, dbghelp.dll, samcli.dll, winhttp.dll) by a non-standard process.
  This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to monitor DLL load events and flags
  when all four DLLs are loaded within a short time frame. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate the presence of Brute Ratel C4, a sophisticated remote access
  tool used for credential dumping and other malicious activities. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could lead to unauthorized access, credential theft, and further compromise
  of the affected system.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 |bin _time span=30s | eval BRC4_AnomalyLoadedDll=case(OriginalFileName=="credui.dll",
  1, OriginalFileName=="DBGHELP.DLL", 1, OriginalFileName=="SAMCLI.DLL", 1, OriginalFileName=="winhttp.dll",
  1, 1=1, 0) | eval BRC4_LoadedDllPath=case(match(ImageLoaded, "credui.dll"), 1, match(ImageLoaded,
  "dbghelp.dll"), 1, match(ImageLoaded, "samcli.dll"), 1, match(ImageLoaded, "winhttp.dll"),
  1, 1=1, 0) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(ImageLoaded)
  as ImageLoaded values(OriginalFileName) as OriginalFileName dc(ImageLoaded) as ImageLoadedCount
  by Image  BRC4_LoadedDllPath BRC4_AnomalyLoadedDll dest EventCode Signed | where  ImageLoadedCount
  == 4 AND (BRC4_LoadedDllPath == 1 OR BRC4_AnomalyLoadedDll == 1) | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_access_software_brc4_loaded_dll_filter`'
how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
  will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to
  work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
known_false_positives: This module can be loaded by a third party application. Filter
  is needed.
