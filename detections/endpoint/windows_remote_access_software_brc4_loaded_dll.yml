description: The following anomaly detection identifies the behavior related to 4
  native Windows DLLs being loaded by a non-standard process. Identified by MDSec
  during their research into Brute Ratel, MDSec identified a high signal analytic
  by calling out these 4 DLLs being loaded into a process. LogonCLI.dll is the Net
  Logon Client DLL and is related to users and other domain services to get authenticated.
  Credui.dll is Credential Manager User Interface. Credential managers receive notifications
  when authentication information changes. For example, credential managers are notified
  when a user logs on or an account password changes. Samcli.dll is the Security Accounts
  Manager Client DLL. Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from
  the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques
  or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored. Dbghelp.dll is
  Windows Image Helper. Windows Image Helper is commonly seen in credential dumping
  due to native functions. All of these modules are important to monitor and track
  and combined may lead to credentail access or dumping.

how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
  will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to
  work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
known_false_positives: This module can be loaded by a third party application. Filter
  is needed.
