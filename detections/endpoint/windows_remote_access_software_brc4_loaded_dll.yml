status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies the loading of four specific Windows DLLs (credui.dll, dbghelp.dll, samcli.dll, winhttp.dll) by a non-standard process. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to monitor DLL load events and flags when all four DLLs are loaded within a short time frame. This activity is significant as it may indicate the presence of Brute Ratel C4, a sophisticated remote access tool used for credential dumping and other malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized access, credential theft, and further compromise of the affected system.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7

how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709 will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
known_false_positives: This module can be loaded by a third party application. Filter is needed.
