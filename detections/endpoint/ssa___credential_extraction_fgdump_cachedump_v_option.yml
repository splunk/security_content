description: Credential extraction is often an illegal recovery of credential material
  from secured authentication resources and repositories. This process may also involve
  decryption or other transformations of the stored credential material. FGdump is
  a newer version of pwdump tool that extracts NTLM and LanMan password hashes from
  Windows. Cachedump is a publicly-available tool that extracts cached password hashes
  from a system's registry.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Windows Security logs from devices of interest,
  including the event ID 4688 with enabled command line logging.
