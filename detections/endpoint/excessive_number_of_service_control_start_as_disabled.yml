description: This detection targets behaviors observed when threat actors have used
  sc.exe to modify services. We observed malware in a honey pot spawning numerous
  sc.exe processes in a short period of time, presumably to impair defenses, possibly
  to block others from compromising the same machine.  This detection will alert when
  we see both an excessive number of sc.exe processes launched with specific commandline
  arguments to disable the start of certain services.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must be ingesting
  logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints. The complete
  process name with command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the
  Endpoint data model.
known_false_positives: Legitimate programs and administrators will execute sc.exe
  with the start disabled flag.  It is possible, but unlikely from the telemetry of
  normal Windows operation we observed, that sc.exe will be called more than seven
  times in a short period of time.
