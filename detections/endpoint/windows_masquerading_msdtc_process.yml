description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious msdtc.exe with specific command-line parameters, particularly -a or -b, 
  which are regarded as potential indicators of the presence of the insidious PlugX malware. This malware is notorious for its covert 
  operations and is frequently utilized by threat actors for unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and espionage.
  The analytic's focus on the -a or -b command-line parameters within msdtc.exe is rooted in the PlugX malware's sophisticated tactic 
  of masquerading its activities. To elude detection, PlugX employs a technique where it injects a concealed, 
  headless PlugX Dynamic Link Library (DLL) module into the legitimate msdtc.exe process. By leveraging these 
  specific command-line parameters, the malware attempts to disguise its presence within a system's legitimate processes, 
  thereby evading immediate suspicion.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
