description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for privilege escalation attempts by non-admin users. 
  These alerts indicate unauthorized efforts by regular users to gain elevated permissions, posing a significant security risk. 
  Detecting and addressing these attempts promptly helps prevent potential breaches and ensures that user privileges remain properly managed, 
  maintaining the integrity of the organization's security protocols.

how_to_implement: To implement CrowdStrike stream JSON logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, 
  authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "CrowdStrike:Event:Streams:JSON" event stream. 
  Process and store the JSON logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.

  manual_test: This detection is marked manual test because the attack_data file and 
    TA do not provide the event.EndpointIp and event.EndpointName fields. event.EndpointName 
    is required to be present for the Risk Message Validation Integration Testing. 
    This will be investigated and is a tracked issue.
