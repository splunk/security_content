description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for privilege escalation attempts by non-admin users. 
  These alerts indicate unauthorized efforts by regular users to gain elevated permissions, posing a significant security risk. 
  Detecting and addressing these attempts promptly helps prevent potential breaches and ensures that user privileges remain properly managed, 
  maintaining the integrity of the organization's security protocols.

how_to_implement: To implement CrowdStrike stream JSON logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, 
  authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "CrowdStrike:Event:Streams:JSON" event stream. 
  Process and store the JSON logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.
