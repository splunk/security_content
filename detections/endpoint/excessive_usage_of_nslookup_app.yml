description: The following analytic detects excessive usage of the nslookup application,
  which may indicate potential DNS exfiltration attempts. It leverages Sysmon EventCode
  1 to monitor process executions, specifically focusing on nslookup.exe. The detection
  identifies outliers by comparing the frequency of nslookup executions against a
  calculated threshold. This activity is significant as it can reveal attempts by
  malware or APT groups to exfiltrate data via DNS queries. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to stealthily transfer sensitive information
  out of the network, bypassing traditional data exfiltration defenses.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '`sysmon` EventCode = 1 process_name = "nslookup.exe" | bucket _time span=1m
  | stats count as numNsLookup by dest, _time | eventstats avg(numNsLookup) as avgNsLookup,
  stdev(numNsLookup) as stdNsLookup, count as numSlots by dest | eval upperThreshold=(avgNsLookup
  + stdNsLookup *3) | eval isOutlier=if(numNsLookup > 20 and numNsLookup >= upperThreshold,
  1, 0) | search isOutlier=1 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `excessive_usage_of_nslookup_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of nslookup.exe may be used.
