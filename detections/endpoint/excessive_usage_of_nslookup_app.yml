description: This search is to detect potential DNS exfiltration using nslookup application.
  This technique are seen in couple of malware and APT group to exfiltrated collected
  data in a infected machine or infected network. This detection is looking for unique
  use of nslookup where it tries to use specific record type (TXT, A, AAAA) that are
  commonly used by attacker and also the retry parameter which is designed to query
  C2 DNS multiple tries.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode = 1 process_name = "nslookup.exe" |  bucket _time span=15m
  | stats count as numNsLookup by Computer, _time |  eventstats avg(numNsLookup) as
  avgNsLookup, stdev(numNsLookup) as stdNsLookup, count as numSlots by Computer |  eval
  upperThreshold=(avgNsLookup + stdNsLookup *3) |  eval isOutlier=if(avgNsLookup >
  20 and avgNsLookup >= upperThreshold, 1, 0) |  search isOutlier=1 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_usage_of_nslookup_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of nslookup.exe may be used.
