status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious registry entry created
  by Qakbot malware as part of its malicious execution. This "Binary Data" Registry  was
  created by newly spawn explorer.exe where its malicious code is injected to it.
  The registry consist of 8 random registry value name with encrypted binary data
  on its registry value data. This anomaly detections can be a good pivot for possible
  Qakbot malware infection or other malware that uses registry to save or store there
  config or malicious code on the registry data stream.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
