description: The following analytic identifies instances where the regsvr32.exe binary
  has been renamed and executed. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) data, specifically focusing on the original filename metadata. Renaming regsvr32.exe
  is significant as it can be an evasion technique used by attackers to bypass security
  controls. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to execute
  arbitrary DLLs, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, or
  persistence within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name != regsvr32.exe
  AND Processes.original_file_name=regsvr32.exe by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.original_file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_regsvr32_renamed_binary_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
