description: The following analytic identifies instances where the regsvr32.exe binary has been renamed and executed. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, specifically focusing on the original filename metadata. Renaming regsvr32.exe is significant as it can be an evasion technique used by attackers to bypass security controls. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary DLLs, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, or persistence within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
