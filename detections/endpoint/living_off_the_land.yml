description: The following correlation identifies a distinct amount of analytics associated
  with the Living Off The Land analytic story that identify potentially suspicious
  behavior.

how_to_implement: To implement this correlation search a user needs to enable all
  detections in the Living Off The Land Analytic Story and confirm it is generating
  risk events. A simple search `index=risk analyticstories="Living Off The Land"`
  should contain events.
known_false_positives: There are no known false positive for this search, but it could
  contain false positives as multiple detections can trigger and not have successful
  exploitation. Modify the static value distinct_detection_name to a higher value.
  It is also required to tune analytics that are also tagged to ensure volume is never
  too much.
