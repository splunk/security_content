description: The following analytic identifies the execution of Node.js with elevated
  privileges using sudo, specifically when spawning child processes. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  executions that include specific Node.js commands. This activity is significant
  because running Node.js as a superuser without dropping privileges can allow unauthorized
  access to the file system and potential privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious,
  this could enable an attacker to maintain privileged access, execute arbitrary code,
  and compromise sensitive data within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*sudo*node*"
  AND Processes.process="*-e*" AND Processes.process="*child_process.spawn*" AND Processes.process="*stdio*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_node_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.
