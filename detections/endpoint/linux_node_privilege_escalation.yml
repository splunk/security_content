description: Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment that is open-source, cross-platform, runs on the V8 engine, 
  and executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It was created to help create scalable network applications.
  If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, 
  escalate or maintain privileged access.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*sudo*node*" AND Processes.process="*-e*" AND Processes.process="*child_process.spawn*" AND Processes.process="*stdio*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_node_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system administrative usage. Filter as needed.
