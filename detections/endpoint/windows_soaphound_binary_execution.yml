description: The following analytic detects the execution of the SOAPHound binary
  (`soaphound.exe`) with specific command-line arguments. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, command-line arguments,
  and other process-related metadata. This activity is significant because SOAPHound
  is a known tool used for credential dumping and other malicious activities. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information,
  escalate privileges, or persist within the environment, posing a severe threat to
  organizational security.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as the command-line arguments
  are specific to SOAPHound. Filter as needed.
