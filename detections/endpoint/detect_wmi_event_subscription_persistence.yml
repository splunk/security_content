description: 'The following analytic identifies the creation of WMI Event Subscriptions,
  which can be used to establish persistence or perform privilege escalation. It detects
  EventID 19 (EventFilter creation), EventID 20 (EventConsumer creation), and EventID
  21 (FilterToConsumerBinding creation) from Sysmon logs. This activity is significant
  because WMI Event Subscriptions can execute code with elevated SYSTEM privileges,
  making it a powerful persistence mechanism. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could maintain long-term access, escalate privileges, and execute arbitrary code,
  posing a severe threat to the environment.'
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 20
search: '`sysmon` EventID=20 | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by Computer User Destination | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_wmi_event_subscription_persistence_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with that provide WMI Event Subscription from your endpoints. If you are using
  Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA and have enabled EventID
  19, 20 and 21. Tune and filter known good to limit the volume.
known_false_positives: It is possible some applications will create a consumer and
  may be required to be filtered. For tuning, add any additional LOLBin's for further
  depth of coverage.
