description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of WMI Event Subscription
  to establish persistence or perform privilege escalation.  WMI can be used to install
  event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined
  event occurs. WMI subscription execution is proxied by the WMI Provider Host process
  (WmiPrvSe.exe) and thus may result in elevated SYSTEM privileges. This analytic
  is restricted by commonly added process execution and a path. If the volume is low
  enough, remove the values and flag on any new subscriptions.\

  All event subscriptions have three components \

  1. Filter - WQL Query for the events we want. EventID equals 19 \

  1. Consumer - An action to take upon triggering the filter. EventID equals 20 \

  1. Binding - Registers a filter to a consumer. EventID equals 21 \

  Monitor for the creation of new WMI EventFilter, EventConsumer, and FilterToConsumerBinding.
  It may be pertinent to review all 3 to identify the flow of execution. In addition,
  EventCode 4104 may assist with any other PowerShell script usage that registered
  the subscription.'
search: '`sysmon` EventID=20 | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by Computer User Destination | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_wmi_event_subscription_persistence_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with that provide WMI Event Subscription from your endpoints. If you are using
  Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA and have enabled EventID
  19, 20 and 21. Tune and filter known good to limit the volume.
known_false_positives: It is possible some applications will create a consumer and
  may be required to be filtered. For tuning, add any additional LOLBin's for further
  depth of coverage.
