description: The following analytic detects the use of SSH to move laterally and execute
  a script or file on a remote host. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific SSH command-line parameters and URLs.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attacker attempting to execute
  remote commands or scripts, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control
  over additional systems. If confirmed malicious, this could result in lateral movement,
  privilege escalation, or the execution of malicious payloads, compromising the security
  of the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process_name=ssh
  Processes.process IN ("*oStrictHostKeyChecking*", "*oConnectTimeout*", "*oBatchMode*")
  AND Processes.process IN ("*http:*","*https:*") by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_ssh_remote_services_script_execute_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This is not a common command to be executed. Filter as needed.
