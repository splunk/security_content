description: The following analytic identifies SSH being utilized to move laterally and execute a script or file on the remote host.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process_name=ssh Processes.process IN ("*oStrictHostKeyChecking*", "*oConnectTimeout*", "*oBatchMode*") AND CommandLine IN ("*http:*","*https:*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_ssh_remote_services_script_execute_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: This is not a common command to be executed. Filter as needed.
