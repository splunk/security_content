description: Detect remote thread creation into LSASS consistent with credential dumping.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=8 TargetImage=*lsass.exe | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, EventCode, TargetImage, TargetProcessId | rename
  Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `create_remote_thread_into_lsass_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs with a Sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 8 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: Other tools can access LSASS for legitimate reasons and generate
  an event. In these cases, tweaking the search may help eliminate noise.

  message: A process has created a remote thread into $TargetImage$ on $dest$. This
    behavior is indicative of credential dumping and should be investigated.
