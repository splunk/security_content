description: The following analytic detects the creation of a remote thread in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). This behavior is identified using Sysmon EventID 8 logs, focusing on processes that create remote threads in lsass.exe. This activity is significant because it is commonly associated with credential dumping, a tactic used by adversaries to steal user authentication credentials. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, leading to potential compromise of the entire network. Analysts should investigate to differentiate between legitimate tools and potential threats.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventID=8 TargetImage=*lsass.exe | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, EventCode, TargetImage, TargetProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `create_remote_thread_into_lsass_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs with a Sysmon configuration, which includes EventCode 8 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: Other tools can access LSASS for legitimate reasons and generate an event. In these cases, tweaking the search may help eliminate noise.
