description: "The following analytic detects the creation of a remote thread in the
  Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). This behavior is identified
  using Sysmon Event ID 8 logs, focusing on processes that create remote threads in
  lsass.exe. This activity is significant because it is commonly associated with credential
  dumping, a tactic used by adversaries to steal user authentication credentials.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to
  sensitive information, leading to potential compromise of the entire network. Analysts
  should investigate to differentiate between legitimate tools and potential threats."
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventID=8 TargetImage=*lsass.exe | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest, EventCode, TargetImage, TargetProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `create_remote_thread_into_lsass_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs with a Sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 8 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: Other tools can access LSASS for legitimate reasons and generate
  an event. In these cases, tweaking the search may help eliminate noise.
