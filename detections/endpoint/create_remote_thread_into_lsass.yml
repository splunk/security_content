description: The following analytic developed to detect potential credential dumping attacks where a remote thread is created in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). Credential dumping, a common tactic used by adversaries to steal user authentication credentials, is a significant threat to network security. The analytic leverages Sysmon Event ID 8 logs and looks for processes creating remote threads in lsass.exe, an unusual activity generally linked to credential theft. The confidence level in this alert is high, but it's worth noting that there might be cases where legitimate tools can access LSASS, generating similar logs. As an analyst, it is critical to understand the broader context of such events and differentiate between legitimate activities and possible threats.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventID=8 TargetImage=*lsass.exe | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest, EventCode, TargetImage, TargetProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `create_remote_thread_into_lsass_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs with a Sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 8 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: Other tools can access LSASS for legitimate reasons and generate
  an event. In these cases, tweaking the search may help eliminate noise.
