description: The following analytic identifies modification of Windows registry using
  regedit.exe application with silent mode parameter. regedit.exe windows application
  is commonly used as GUI app to check or modify registry. This application is also
  has undocumented command-line parameter and one of those are silent mode parameter
  that performs action without stopping for confirmation with dialog box. Importing
  registry from .reg files need to monitor in a production environment since it can
  be used adversaries to import RMS registry in compromised host.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name="regedit.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name="regedit.exe")
  AND Processes.process="* /s *" AND Processes.process="*.reg*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_regedit_silent_reg_import_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Administrators may execute this command that may cause some
  false positive. Filter as needed.
