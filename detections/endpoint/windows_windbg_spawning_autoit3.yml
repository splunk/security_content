description: The following analytic identifies instances of the WinDBG process spawning AutoIt3. This behavior may indicate malicious activity as AutoIt3 is often used by threat actors for scripting malicious automation. The search specifically looks for instances where the parent process name is 'windbg.exe' and the process name is 'autoit3.exe' or 'autoit*.exe'. During the triage process, it is recommended to review the file path for additional artifacts that may provide further insights into the event.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes  where Processes.parent_process_name=windbg.exe  AND (Processes.process_name IN ("autoit3.exe", "autoit*.exe") OR Processes.original_file_name IN ("autoit3.exe", "autoit*.exe")) by Processes.dest, Processes.user, Processes.parent_process_name, Processes.process_name, Processes.original_file_name, Processes.process, Processes.process_id, Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | eval matches_extension=if(match(process, "\\.(au3|a3x|exe|aut|aup)$"), "Yes", "No")
  | search matches_extension="Yes" | `windows_windbg_spawning_autoit3_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will only be present if the WinDBG process legitimately spawns AutoIt3. Filter as needed.
