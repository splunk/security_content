description: The following analytic identifies DNS queries to known TOR proxy websites,
  such as "*.torproject.org" and "www.theonionrouter.com". It leverages Sysmon EventCode
  22 to detect these queries by monitoring DNS query events from endpoints. This activity
  is significant because adversaries often use TOR proxies to disguise the source
  of their malicious traffic, making it harder to trace their actions. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could indicate an attempt to obfuscate network traffic,
  potentially allowing attackers to exfiltrate data or communicate with command and
  control servers undetected.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*.torproject.org", "www.theonionrouter.com")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName
  QueryStatus ProcessId  Computer | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_multi_hop_proxy_tor_website_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and sysmon eventcode = 22 dns query events from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: third party application may use this proxies if allowed in
  production environment. Filter is needed.
