description: This search is to detect a suspicious MS office application that drop
  or create executables or script in the host. This behavior is commonly seen in spear
  phishing office attachment where it drop malicious files or script to compromised
  the host. It might be some normal macro may drop script or tools as part of automation
  but still this behavior is reallly suspicious and not commonly seen in normal office
  application
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name IN ("winword.exe","excel.exe","powerpnt.exe","mspub.exe","visio.exe","wordpad.exe","wordview.exe")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: office macro for automation may do this behavior
