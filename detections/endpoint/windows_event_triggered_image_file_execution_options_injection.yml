type: Hunting
description: The following hunting analytic identifies EventCode 3000 in Application
  channel indicating a process exit. This behavior is based on process names being
  added to the Image File Execution Options under HKLM \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
  NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\ and \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
  NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit. Once these are set for a process, an eventcode
  3000 will generate. The example used is from Thinkst Canary where a CanaryToken
  is setup to monitor for a commonly abused living off the land binary (ex. Klist.exe)
  and generate an event when it occurs. This can be seen as settings traps to monitor
  for suspicious behavior. Monitor and tune this hunting analytic and setup traps
  across your organization and begin monitoring.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Application 3000
search: '`wineventlog_application` EventCode=3000 | rename param1 AS "Process" param2
  AS "Exit_Code" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Process
  Exit_Code dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_event_triggered_image_file_execution_options_injection_filter`'
how_to_implement: This analytic requires capturing the Windows Event Log Application
  channel in XML.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and tuning will be required
  before turning into a TTP or notable.
