description: The following analytic identifies the creation or modification of Image
  File Execution Options (IFEO) registry keys, detected via EventCode 3000 in the
  Application channel. This detection leverages Windows Event Logs to monitor for
  process names added to IFEO under specific registry paths. This activity is significant
  as it can indicate attempts to set traps for process monitoring or debugging, often
  used by attackers for persistence or evasion. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or manipulate process behavior, leading
  to potential system compromise.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Application 3000
search: '`wineventlog_application` EventCode=3000 | rename param1 AS "Process" param2
  AS "Exit_Code" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Process
  Exit_Code dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_event_triggered_image_file_execution_options_injection_filter`'
how_to_implement: This analytic requires capturing the Windows Event Log Application
  channel in XML.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and tuning will be required
  before turning into a TTP or notable.
