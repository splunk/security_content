search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\SmartScreenEnabled"  Registry.registry_value_name
  = "Off" by Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name
  Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `disable_windows_smartscreen_protection_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
