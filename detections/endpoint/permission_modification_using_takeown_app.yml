- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a modification of file or directory permission
  using takeown.exe windows app. This technique was seen in some ransomware that take
  the ownership of a folder or files to encrypt or delete it.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "takeown.exe"
  Processes.process = "*/f*" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `permission_modification_using_takeown_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: takeown.exe is a normal windows application that may used by
  network operator.
