description: The following analytic detects a suspicious PowerShell command that allows
  inbound traffic to a specific local port within the public profile. It leverages
  PowerShell script block logging (EventCode 4104) to identify commands containing
  keywords like "firewall," "Inbound," "Allow," and "-LocalPort." This activity is
  significant because it may indicate an attacker attempting to establish remote access
  by modifying firewall rules. If confirmed malicious, this could allow unauthorized
  access to the machine, potentially leading to further exploitation and data exfiltration.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*firewall*" ScriptBlockText
  = "*Inbound*" ScriptBlockText = "*Allow*"  ScriptBlockText = "*-LocalPort*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `allow_inbound_traffic_in_firewall_rule_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the powershell logs  from your endpoints. make sure you enable needed
  registry to monitor this event.
known_false_positives: administrator may allow inbound traffic in certain network
  or machine.
