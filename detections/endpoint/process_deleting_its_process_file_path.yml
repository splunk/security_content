name: Process Deleting Its Process File Path

description: The following analytic identifies a process attempting to delete its
  own file path, a behavior often associated with defense evasion techniques. This
  detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 1 logs, focusing on command lines executed
  via cmd.exe that include deletion commands. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate malware, such as Clop ransomware, trying to evade detection by removing
  its executable file if certain conditions are met. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow the attacker to persist undetected, complicating incident response and
  remediation efforts.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=1 CommandLine = "* /c *" CommandLine = "* del*" Image
  = "*\\cmd.exe" | eval result = if(like(process,"%".parent_process."%"), "Found",
  "Not Found") | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by dest
  user ParentImage ParentCommandLine Image CommandLine EventCode ProcessID result
  | where result = "Found" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `process_deleting_its_process_file_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
