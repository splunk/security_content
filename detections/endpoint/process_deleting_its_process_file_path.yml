description: This detection is to identify a suspicious process that tries to delete
  the process file path related to its process. This technique is known to be defense
  evasion once a certain condition of malware is satisfied or not. Clop ransomware
  use this technique where it will try to delete its process file path using a .bat
  command if the keyboard layout is not the layout it tries to infect.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=1 CommandLine = "* /c *" CommandLine = "* del*" Image
  = "*\\cmd.exe" | eval result = if(like(process,"%".parent_process."%"), "Found",
  "Not Found") | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by dest
  user ParentImage ParentCommandLine Image CommandLine EventCode ProcessID result
  | where result = "Found" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `process_deleting_its_process_file_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
