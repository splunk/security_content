description: This detection is to identify a suspicious process that tries to delete
  the process file path related to its process. This technique is known to be defense
  evasion once a certain condition of malware is satisfied or not. Clop ransomware
  use this technique where it will try to delete its process file path using a .bat
  command if the keyboard layout is not the layout it tries to infect.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=1 cmdline = "*/c del*" Image = "*\\cmd.exe" |eval result
  = if(like(process,"%".parent_process."%"), "Found", "Not Found") | stats min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Computer user ParentImage ParentCommandLine
  Image cmdline EventCode ProcessID result | where result = "Found" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `process_deleting_its_process_file_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
