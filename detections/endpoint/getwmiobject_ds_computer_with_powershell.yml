description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments that utilize the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to discover remote
  systems, specifically targeting the `DS_Computer` parameter. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
  and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
  reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to enumerate domain computers and gather situational
  awareness within Active Directory. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow
  attackers to map the network, identify critical systems, and plan further attacks,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
