- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the PowerView PowerShell
  cmdlet Get-NetUser with the UACFilter parameter set to NOT_ACCOUNTDISABLE, indicating
  an attempt to enumerate Active Directory user accounts that are not disabled. This
  detection leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104) to identify
  the specific script block text. Monitoring this activity is significant as it may
  indicate reconnaissance efforts by an attacker to identify active user accounts
  for further exploitation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized
  access, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the network.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104  ScriptBlockText = "*Get-NetUser*" ScriptBlockText
  = "*NOT_ACCOUNTDISABLE*" ScriptBlockText = "*-UACFilter*" | rename Computer as dest,
  UserID as user | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode
  ScriptBlockText dest user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_account_discovery_for_none_disable_user_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.=
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerView for legitimate purposes,
  filter as needed.
