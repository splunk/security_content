description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious process terminating Lsass process.
  Lsass process is known to be a critical process that is responsible for enforcing
  security policy system. This process was commonly targetted by threat actor or red
  teamer to gain privilege escalation or persistence in the targeted machine because
  it handles credentials of the logon users. In this analytic we tried to detect a
  suspicious process having a granted access PROCESS_TERMINATE to lsass process to
  modify or delete protected registrys. This technique was seen in doublezero malware
  that tries to wipe files and registry in compromised hosts. This anomaly detection
  can be a good pivot of incident response for possible credential dumping or evading
  security policy in a host or network environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe GrantedAccess = 0x1 | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage, TargetImage,
  TargetProcessId, SourceProcessId, GrantedAccess CallTrace, dest | rename dest
  as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_terminating_lsass_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requires Sysmon Logs and a Sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 10 for lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
