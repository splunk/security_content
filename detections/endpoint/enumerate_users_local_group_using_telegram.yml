description: This analytic will detect a suspicious Telegram process enumerating all
  network users in a local group. This technique was seen in a Monero infected honeypot
  to mapped all the users on the compromised system. EventCode 4798 is generated when
  a process enumerates a user's security-enabled local groups on a computer or device.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4798  Process_Name = "*\\telegram.exe" |
  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName EventCode
  Process_Name  Process_ID Account_Name Account_Domain Logon_ID Security_ID Message
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `enumerate_users_local_group_using_telegram_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Task Schedule (Exa. Security Log EventCode 4798) endpoints. Tune and
  filter known instances of process like logonUI used in your environment.
