datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious commandline designed to delete
  files or directory recursive using batch command. This technique was seen in ransomware
  (reddot) where it it tries to delete the files in recycle bin to impaire user from
  recovering deleted files.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_cmd` Processes.process=*/c*  Processes.process=*
  rd * Processes.process="*/s*" Processes.process="*/q*" by Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.dest |`drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `recursive_delete_of_directory_in_batch_cmd_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: network operator may use this batch command to delete recursively
  a directory or files within directory
