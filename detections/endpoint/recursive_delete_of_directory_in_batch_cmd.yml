- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious commandline designed to delete
  files or directory recursive using batch command. This technique was seen in ransomware
  (reddot) where it it tries to delete the files in recycle bin to impaire user from
  recovering deleted files.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=cmd.exe
  Processes.process=*/c*  Processes.process=* rd * Processes.process="*/s*" Processes.process="*/q*"
  by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.dest |`drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `recursive_delete_of_directory_in_batch_cmd_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network operator may use this batch command to delete recursively
  a directory or files within directory
