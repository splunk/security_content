description: This search is to detect a suspicious commandline designed to delete
  files or directory recursive using batch command. This technique was seen in ransomware
  (reddot) where it it tries to delete the files in recycle bin to impaire user from
  recovering deleted files.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_cmd` Processes.process=*/c*  Processes.process="*
  rd *"  Processes.process="*/s*" Processes.process="*/q*" by Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.dest |`drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `recursive_delete_of_directory_in_batch_cmd_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network operator may use this batch command to delete recursively
  a directory or files within directory
