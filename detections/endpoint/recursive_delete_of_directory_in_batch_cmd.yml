description: The following analytic detects the execution of a batch command designed
  to recursively delete files or directories, a technique often used by ransomware
  like Reddot to delete files in the recycle bin and prevent recovery. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  executions that include specific flags for recursive and quiet deletions. This activity
  is significant as it indicates potential ransomware behavior aimed at data destruction.
  If confirmed malicious, it could lead to significant data loss and hinder recovery
  efforts, severely impacting business operations.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_cmd` Processes.process=*/c*  Processes.process="*
  rd *"  Processes.process="*/s*" Processes.process="*/q*" by Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.dest |`drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `recursive_delete_of_directory_in_batch_cmd_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network operator may use this batch command to delete recursively
  a directory or files within directory
