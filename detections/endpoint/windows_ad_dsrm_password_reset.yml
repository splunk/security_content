description: Aside from being used to promote genuine domain controllers, the DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode)
  account can be used to persist within a Domain. A DC can be configured to allow the DSRM account to logon & be
 used in the same way as a local administrator account. This detection is looking for any password reset attempts against that account. 
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as _time from datamodel=Change
  where All_Changes.result_id="4794" AND All_Changes.result="An attempt was made to
  set the Directory Services Restore Mode administrator password" by All_Changes.action, 
  All_Changes.dest, All_Changes.src, All_Changes.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(All_Changes)` | `windows_ad_dsrm_password_reset_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting eventcode
 `4794` and  have the Advanced Security Audit policy
 `Audit User Account Management` within `Account Management` enabled. 
known_false_positives: Resetting the DSRM password for legitamate reasons, i.e. forgot the password. Disaster recovery. Deploying AD backdoor deliberately.
