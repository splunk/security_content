- Endpoint
description: The following analytic is to detect events that attempts to disable a service. 
  This is typically identified in parallel with other instances of service enumeration of 
  attempts to stop a service and then delete it. Adversaries utilize this technique like industroyer2 
  malware to terminate security services or other related services to continue there objective as a destructive payload.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name IN ("systemctl", "service", "svcadm")  Processes.process = "* disable*" 
  by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `linux_disable_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
