description: This following analytic detects PowerShell command to delete shadow copy
  using the WMIC PowerShell module. This technique was seen used by a recent adversary
  to deploy DarkSide Ransomware where it executed a child process of PowerShell to
  execute a hex encoded command to delete shadow copy. This hex encoded command was
  able to be decrypted by PowerShell log.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText= "*ShadowCopy*" (ScriptBlockText = "*Delete*"
  OR ScriptBlockText = "*Remove*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by Opcode Computer
  UserID EventCode ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `delete_shadowcopy_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the powershell logs  from your endpoints. make sure you enable needed
  registry to monitor this event.
