description: The following analytic detects the use of PowerShell to delete shadow
  copies via the WMIC PowerShell module. It leverages EventCode 4104 and searches
  for specific keywords like "ShadowCopy," "Delete," or "Remove" within the ScriptBlockText.
  This activity is significant because deleting shadow copies is a common tactic used
  by ransomware, such as DarkSide, to prevent data recovery. If confirmed malicious,
  this action could lead to irreversible data loss and hinder recovery efforts, significantly
  impacting business continuity and data integrity.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText= "*ShadowCopy*" (ScriptBlockText
  = "*Delete*" OR ScriptBlockText = "*Remove*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by Opcode Computer UserID EventCode ScriptBlockText |rename
  Computer as dest |rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `delete_shadowcopy_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the powershell logs  from your endpoints. make sure you enable needed
  registry to monitor this event.
