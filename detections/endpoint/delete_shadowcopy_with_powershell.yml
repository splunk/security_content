description: This following analytic detects PowerShell command to delete shadow copy
  using the WMIC PowerShell module. This technique was seen used by a recent adversary
  to deploy DarkSide Ransomware where it executed a child process of PowerShell to
  execute a hex encoded command to delete shadow copy. This hex encoded command was
  able to be decrypted by PowerShell log.
