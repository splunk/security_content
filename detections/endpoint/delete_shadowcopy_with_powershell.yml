description: This following analytic detects PowerShell command to delete shadow copy
  using the WMIC PowerShell module. This technique was seen used by a recent adversary
  to deploy DarkSide Ransomware where it executed a child process of PowerShell to
  execute a hex encoded command to delete shadow copy. This hex encoded command was
  able to be decrypted by PowerShell log.
data_source:
- Powershell 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText= "*ShadowCopy*" (ScriptBlockText
  = "*Delete*" OR ScriptBlockText = "*Remove*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by Opcode Computer UserID EventCode ScriptBlockText |rename Computer as dest |rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `delete_shadowcopy_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the powershell logs  from your endpoints. make sure you enable needed
  registry to monitor this event.
