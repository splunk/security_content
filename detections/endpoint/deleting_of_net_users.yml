description: The following analytic detects the use of net.exe or net1.exe command-line
  to delete a user account on a system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and command-line execution logs.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to impair user accounts
  or cover tracks during lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
  to unauthorized access removal, disruption of legitimate user activities, or concealment
  of adversarial actions, complicating incident response and forensic investigations.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: System administrators or scripts may delete user accounts via
  this technique. Filter as needed.
