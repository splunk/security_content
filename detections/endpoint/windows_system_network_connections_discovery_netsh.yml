description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS built-in
  tool netsh.exe to show state, configuration and profile of host firewall. This tool
  is being used or abused by several adversaries or even post exploitation tool to
  bypass firewall rules or to discover firewall settings. This hunting detection can
  help to detect a possible suspicious usage of netsh.exe to retrieve firewall settings
  or even firewall wlan profile. We recommend checking which parent process and process
  name execute this command. Also check the process file path for verification that
  may lead to further TTP's threat behavior.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_netsh`AND Processes.process
  = "* show *" Processes.process IN ("*state*", "*config*", "*wlan*", "*profile*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_system_network_connections_discovery_netsh_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.
