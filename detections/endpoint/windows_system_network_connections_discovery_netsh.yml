description: The following analytic detects the execution of the Windows built-in
  tool netsh.exe to display the state, configuration, and profile of the host firewall.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on command-line executions and process metadata. Monitoring this activity
  is crucial as netsh.exe can be used by adversaries to bypass firewall rules or discover
  firewall settings. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to
  manipulate firewall configurations, potentially leading to unauthorized network
  access or data exfiltration.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_netsh`AND Processes.process
  = "* show *" Processes.process IN ("*state*", "*config*", "*wlan*", "*profile*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.
