description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS built-in tool netsh.exe to show state, configuration and profile of host firewall. 
  This tool is being used or abused by several adversaries or even post exploitation tool to bypass firewall rules or to discover firewall settings. 
  This hunting detection can help to detect a possible suspicious usage of netsh.exe to retrieve firewall settings or even firewall wlan profile. 
  We recommend checking which parent process and process name execute this command. Also check the process file path for verification that may lead to further 
  TTP's threat behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_netsh`AND Processes.process = "* show *" Processes.process IN ("*state*", "*config*", "*wlan*", "*profile*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid 
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_system_network_connections_discovery_netsh_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.
