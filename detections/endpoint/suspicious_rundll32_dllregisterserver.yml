description: The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe with the
  DllRegisterServer command to load a DLL. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process details.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to register a malicious
  DLL, which can be a method for code execution or persistence. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could gain unauthorized code execution, escalate privileges, or maintain
  persistence within the environment, posing a severe security risk.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` Processes.process=*dllregisterserver*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_rundll32_dllregisterserver_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This is likely to produce false positives and will require
  some filtering. Tune the query by adding command line paths to known good DLLs,
  or filtering based on parent process names.
