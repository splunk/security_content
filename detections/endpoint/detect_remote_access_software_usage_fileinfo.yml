description: The following analytic detects the execution of processes with file or code signing attributes from known remote access software within the environment. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 1 data and cross-references a lookup table of remote access utilities such as AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, and TeamViewer. This activity is significant as adversaries often use these tools to maintain unauthorized remote access. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to persist in the environment, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further compromise of the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=1 | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime, values(Company) as Company values(Product) as Product by dest, user, parent_process_name, process_name, process | lookup remote_access_software remote_utility_fileinfo AS Product OUTPUT isutility, description as signature, comment_reference as desc, category | search isutility = True | `remote_access_software_usage_exceptions` | `detect_remote_access_software_usage_fileinfo_filter`'
how_to_implement: This analytic relies on Sysmon to be properly installed and utilized in the environment. Ensure that proper logging is setup for Sysmon and data is being ingested into Splunk. The "exceptions" macro leverages both an Assets and Identities lookup, as well as a KVStore collection named "remote_software_exceptions" that lets you track and maintain device-based exceptions for this set of detections.
known_false_positives: Known or approved applications used by the organization or usage of built-in functions. Known false positives can be added to the remote_access_software_usage_exception.csv lookup to globally suppress these situations across all remote access content
