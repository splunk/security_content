author: Steven Dick, Teoderick Contreras, Splunk
status: production
type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to hide
  common windows notification feature from compromised host. This technique was seen
  in some ransomware family to add more impact to its payload that are visually seen
  by user aside from the encrypted files and ransomware notes. Even this a good anomaly
  detection, administrator may implement this changes for auditing or security reason.
  In this scenario filter is needed.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 12
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  WHERE (Registry.registry_path= "*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\*"
  Registry.registry_value_name IN ("HideClock", "HideSCAHealth", "HideSCANetwork",
  "HideSCAPower", "HideSCAVolume") Registry.registry_value_data = "0x00000001") BY
  _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name
  Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_hide_notification_features_through_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the offical
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
