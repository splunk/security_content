description: The following analytic identifies behavior related to CVE-2021-40444.
  Whereas the malicious document will load ActiveX and download the remote payload
  (.inf, .cab). During triage, review parallel processes and further activity on endpoint
  to identify additional patterns. Retrieve the file modifications and analyze further.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name IN ("winword.exe","excel.exe","powerpnt.exe","mspub.exe","visio.exe","wordpad.exe","wordview.exe","onenote.exe","onenotem.exe","onenoteviewer.exe","onenoteim.exe")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node and `Filesystem`
  node.
known_false_positives: The query is structured in a way that `action` (read, create)
  is not defined. Review the results of this query, filter, and tune as necessary.
  It may be necessary to generate this query specific to your endpoint product.
