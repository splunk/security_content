description: The following analytic identifies behavior related to CVE-2021-40444.
  Whereas the malicious document will load ActiveX and download the remote payload
  (.inf, .cab). During triage, review parallel processes and further activity on endpoint
  to identify additional patterns. Retrieve the file modifications and analyze further.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name IN ("winword.exe","excel.exe","powerpnt.exe","mspub.exe","visio.exe","wordpad.exe","wordview.exe")
  by _time span=1h Processes.process_id Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.dest
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | join process_guid, _time [| tstats `security_content_summariesonly`
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where Filesystem.file_name IN ("*.inf","*.cab") by _time span=1h Filesystem.dest
  Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | fields _time dest file_create_time file_name file_path process_name process_path
  process] | dedup file_create_time | table dest, process_name, process, file_create_time,
  file_name, file_path | `office_product_writing_cab_or_inf_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node and `Filesystem`
  node.
known_false_positives: The query is structured in a way that `action` (read, create)
  is not defined. Review the results of this query, filter, and tune as necessary.
  It may be necessary to generate this query specific to your endpoint product.
