description: The following analytic detects processes attempting to connect to known
  IP check web services. This behavior is identified using Sysmon EventCode 22 logs,
  specifically monitoring DNS queries to services like "wtfismyip.com" and "ipinfo.io".
  This activity is significant as it is commonly used by malware, such as Trickbot,
  for reconnaissance to determine the infected machine's IP address. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow attackers to gather network information, aiding in further
  attacks or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22  QueryName IN ("*wtfismyip.com", "*checkip.*", "*ipecho.net",
  "*ipinfo.io", "*api.ipify.org", "*icanhazip.com", "*ip.anysrc.com","*api.ip.sb",
  "ident.me", "www.myexternalip.com", "*zen.spamhaus.org", "*cbl.abuseat.org", "*b.barracudacentral.org",
  "*dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net", "*spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net", "*iplogger.org*", "*ip-api.com*",
  "*geoip.*", "*icanhazip.*") |  stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by  Image
  ProcessId QueryName QueryStatus QueryResults EventCode Computer | rename Computer
  as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_gather_victim_network_info_through_ip_check_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, dns query name process path , and query ststus from
  your endpoints like EventCode 22. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 12 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Filter internet browser application to minimize the false positive
  of this detection.
