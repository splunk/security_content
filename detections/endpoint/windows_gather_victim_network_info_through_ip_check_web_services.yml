description: The following analytic identifies process that
  attempts to connect to a known IP web services. This technique is commonly used by trickbot and
  other malware to perform reconnaissance against the infected machine and look for its IP address.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22  QueryName IN ("*wtfismyip.com", "*checkip.amazonaws.com", "*ipecho.net", "*ipinfo.io", "*api.ipify.org", 
  "*icanhazip.com", "*ip.anysrc.com","*api.ip.sb", "ident.me", "www.myexternalip.com", "*zen.spamhaus.org", "*cbl.abuseat.org", "*b.barracudacentral.org",
  "*dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net", "*spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net", "*iplogger.org*", "*ip-api.com*") 
  |  stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by  Image ProcessId QueryName QueryStatus QueryResults Computer EventCode 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_gather_victim_network_info_through_ip_check_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, dns query name process path , and query ststus from
  your endpoints like EventCode 22. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 12 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Filter internet browser application to minimize the false positive of this detection.
