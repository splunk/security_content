description: The following analytic detects the creation of .iso.lnk files in the
  %USER%\AppData\Local\Temp\<random folder name>\ path, indicating that an ISO file
  has been mounted and accessed. This detection leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem
  data model, specifically monitoring file creation events in the Windows Recent folder.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate the delivery and execution of potentially
  malicious payloads via ISO files. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  code execution, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\*")
  Filesystem.file_name IN ("*.iso.lnk", "*.img.lnk", "*.vhd.lnk", "*vhdx.lnk") by
  Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.process_id Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path
  Filesystem.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_iso_lnk_file_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be high depending on the environment and
  consistent use of ISOs mounting. Restrict to servers, or filter out based on commonly
  used ISO names. Filter as needed.
