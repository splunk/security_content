description: The following analytic identifies the use of a delivered ISO file that
  has been mounted and the afformention lnk or file opened within it. When the ISO
  file is opened, the files are saved in the %USER%\AppData\Local\Temp\<random folder
  name>\ path. The analytic identifies .iso.lnk written to the path. The name of the
  ISO file is prepended.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\*")
  Filesystem.file_name IN ("*.iso.lnk", "*.img.lnk", "*.vhd.lnk", "*vhdx.lnk") by
  Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.process_id Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path
  Filesystem.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_iso_lnk_file_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be high depending on the environment and
  consistent use of ISOs mounting. Restrict to servers, or filter out based on commonly
  used ISO names. Filter as needed.
