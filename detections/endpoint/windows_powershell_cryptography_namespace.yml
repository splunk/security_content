type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell script execution
  via EventCode 4104 that is processing cryptography namespace library. This technique
  was seen in several powershell malware, loader, downloader and stager that will
  decrypt or decode the next malicious stager or the actual payload. This Anomaly
  detection can be a good indicator that a powershell process to decrypt code. We
  recommend to further check the parent_process_name, the file or data it tries to
  decrypt, network connection and user who execute the script.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*System.Security.Cryptography*"
  AND NOT(ScriptBlockText IN ("*SHA*", "*MD5*", "*DeriveBytes*")) | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_powershell_cryptography_namespace_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited. Filter as needed.
