description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to define the threat action of Windows Defender. 
  The ThreatSeverityDefaultAction registry setting in Windows Defender is used to define the default action taken by Windows Defender 
  when it encounters threats of specific severity levels.
  A setting like ThreatSeverityDefaultAction is designed to define how Windows Defender responds to threats based on their severity. 
  For example, it might determine whether Windows Defender quarantines, removes, or takes other actions against threats based on their severity levels.
  In this context, a registry value of 1 typically indicates an action to "clean," aiming to disinfect or resolve the detected threat, 
  while a registry value of 9 signifies "no action," meaning that the antivirus software refrains from taking immediate steps against the identified threat.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows Defender\\Threats\\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction*" 
  Registry.registry_value_data IN ("0x00000001", "9")
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action Registry.dest

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_impair_defense_define_win_defender_threat_action_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
