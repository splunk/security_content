description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows Defender
  ThreatSeverityDefaultAction registry setting. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
  datamodel to identify changes in registry values that define how Windows Defender
  responds to threats. This activity is significant because altering these settings
  can impair the system's defense mechanisms, potentially allowing threats to go unaddressed.
  If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to bypass antivirus protections,
  leading to persistent threats and increased risk of data compromise or further system
  exploitation.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\Threats\\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction*" Registry.registry_value_data IN
  ("0x00000001", "9") by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_define_win_defender_threat_action_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
