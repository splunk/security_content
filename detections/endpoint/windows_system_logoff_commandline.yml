description: The following analytic detects the execution of the Windows command line to log off a host machine. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on processes involving `shutdown.exe` with specific parameters. This activity is significant as it is often associated with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) like dcrat, which use this technique to disrupt operations, aid in system destruction, or inhibit recovery. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to system downtime, data loss, or hindered incident response efforts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator may execute this commandline to trigger shutdown, logoff or restart the host machine.
