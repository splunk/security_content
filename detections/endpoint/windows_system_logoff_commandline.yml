description: The following analytic identifies Windows commandline to logoff a windows host machine. 
  This technique was seen in several APT, RAT like dcrat and other commodity malware to shutdown the machine to add more impact, 
  interrupt access, aid destruction of the system like wiping disk or inhibit system recovery.
  This TTP is a good pivot to check why application trigger this commandline which is not so common way to logoff a machine.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name = shutdown.exe OR Processes.original_file_name = shutdown.exe) Processes.process="*shutdown*" Processes.process="* /l*" Processes.process="* /t*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_system_logoff_commandline_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Administrator may execute this commandline to trigger shutdown, logoff or restart the host machine.
