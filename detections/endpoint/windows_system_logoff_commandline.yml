description: The following analytic identifies Windows commandline to logoff a windows
  host machine. This technique was seen in several APT, RAT like dcrat and other commodity
  malware to shutdown the machine to add more impact, interrupt access, aid destruction
  of the system like wiping disk or inhibit system recovery. This TTP is a good pivot
  to check why application trigger this commandline which is not so common way to
  logoff a machine.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name = shutdown.exe OR Processes.original_file_name = shutdown.exe)
  Processes.process="*shutdown*" Processes.process="* /l*" Processes.process="* /t*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_system_logoff_commandline_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator may execute this commandline to trigger shutdown,
  logoff or restart the host machine.
