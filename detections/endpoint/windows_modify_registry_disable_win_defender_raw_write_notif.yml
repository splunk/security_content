description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that disable the Windows Defender raw write notification feature. It leverages data
  from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to the registry
  path associated with Windows Defender's real-time protection settings. This activity
  is significant because disabling raw write notifications can allow malware, such
  as Azorult, to bypass Windows Defender's behavior monitoring, potentially leading
  to undetected malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers
  to execute code, persist in the environment, and access sensitive information without
  detection.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive. Filter as needed.
