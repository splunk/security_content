description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry
  to disable Windows Defender raw write notification feature. This policy controls
  whether raw volume write notifications are sent to behavior monitoring or not. This
  registry was recently identified in Azorult malware to bypass Windows Defender detections
  or behavior monitoring in terms of volume write.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\Real-Time Protection\\DisableRawWriteNotification*" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001"

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive. Filter as needed.
