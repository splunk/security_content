description: The following analytic identifies processes running from file paths not
  typically associated with legitimate software. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific process paths within the Endpoint
  data model. This activity is significant because adversaries often use unconventional
  file paths to execute malicious code without requiring administrative privileges.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate an attempt to bypass security
  controls, leading to unauthorized software execution, potential system compromise,
  and further malicious activities within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow execution of specific binaries in
  non-standard paths. Filter as needed.
