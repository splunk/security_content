description: The following analytic will detect a suspicious process running in a
  file path where a process is not commonly seen and is most commonly used by malicious
  software. This behavior has been used by adversaries where they drop and run an
  exe in a path that is accessible without admin privileges.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_path = "*\\windows\\fonts\\*"
  OR Processes.process_path = "*\\windows\\temp\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\users\\public\\*"
  OR Processes.process_path = "*\\windows\\debug\\*" OR Processes.process_path.file_path

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_process_file_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow execution of specific binaries in
  non-standard paths. Filter as needed.
