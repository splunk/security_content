description: This analytic identifies a suspicious processes running in file paths
  that are not typically associated with legitimate software. Adversaries often employ
  this technique to drop and execute malicious executables in accessible locations
  that do not require administrative privileges. By monitoring for processes running
  in such unconventional file paths, we can identify potential indicators of compromise
  and proactively respond to malicious activity. This analytic plays a crucial role
  in enhancing system security by pinpointing suspicious behaviors commonly associated
  with malware and unauthorized software execution.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow execution of specific binaries in
  non-standard paths. Filter as needed.
