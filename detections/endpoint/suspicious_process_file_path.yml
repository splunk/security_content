description: This analytic identifies a suspicious processes running in file paths 
  that are not typically associated with legitimate software. Adversaries often employ this technique 
  to drop and execute malicious executables in accessible locations that do not require administrative privileges. 
  By monitoring for processes running in such unconventional file paths, we can identify potential indicators of 
  compromise and proactively respond to malicious activity. This analytic plays a crucial role in enhancing system 
  security by pinpointing suspicious behaviors commonly associated with malware and unauthorized software execution.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow execution of specific binaries in
  non-standard paths. Filter as needed.
