description: The following analytic detects suspicious stopping of the `osquery` service,
  which may indicate an attempt to disable monitoring and evade detection. `Osquery`
  is a powerful tool used for querying system information and detecting anomalies,
  and stopping its service can be a sign that an attacker is trying to disrupt security
  monitoring or hide malicious activities. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized
  stops of the `osquery` service, this analytic helps identify potential efforts to
  bypass security controls, enabling security teams to investigate and respond to
  possible threats effectively.

how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
