type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic is developed to detect suspicious pdf viewer processes that have a browser application child processes. 
  This event was seen in a pdf spear phishing attachment containing a malicious URL link to download the actual payload. 
  When a user clicks the malicious link the pdf viewer application will execute a process of the host default browser 
  to connect to the malicious site. This anomaly detection can be a good indicator that a possible pdf file has a link 
  executed by a user. The pdf viewer and browser list in this detection is still in progress, add the common browser 
  and pdf viewer you use in opening pdf in your network.  
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.parent_process_name  IN ("AcroRd32.exe", "FoxitPDFReader.exe") Processes.process_name IN ("firefox.exe", "chrome.exe", "iexplore.exe")  
    by Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name  Processes.parent_process Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.dest 
  |`drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_phishing_pdf_file_executes_url_link_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting
  information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the
  changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
  In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest
  TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives in PDF file opened PDF Viewer having legitimate URL link, however filter as needed.
