name: Disabled Kerberos Pre-Authentication Discovery With Get-ADUser

status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-ADUser` PowerShell cmdlet with parameters indicating a search for domain accounts with Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this specific activity. This behavior is significant because discovering accounts with Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled can allow adversaries to perform offline password cracking. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially compromising sensitive information and escalating privileges within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText = "*Get-ADUser*" AND ScriptBlockText="*4194304*") | stats count min(_time)  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Opcode Computer UserID EventCode ScriptBlockText | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `disabled_kerberos_pre_authentication_discovery_with_get_aduser_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use search for accounts with Kerberos Pre Authentication disabled for legitimate purposes.
