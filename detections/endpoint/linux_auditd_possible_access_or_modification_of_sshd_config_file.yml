name: Linux Auditd Possible Access Or Modification Of Sshd Config File

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects suspicious access or modification of the sshd_config file on Linux systems. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on command-line executions involving processes like "cat," "nano," "vim," and "vi" accessing the sshd_config file. This activity is significant because unauthorized changes to sshd_config can allow threat actors to redirect port connections or use unauthorized keys, potentially compromising the system. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or persistent backdoor access, posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Path
search: '`linux_auditd` type=PATH name="/etc/ssh/ssh_config*" | rename host as dest | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by name nametype OGID type dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_possible_access_or_modification_of_sshd_config_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this commandline for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
