how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process names and image loads from your endpoints. If you are using
  Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives will be present, however, tune as necessary.
