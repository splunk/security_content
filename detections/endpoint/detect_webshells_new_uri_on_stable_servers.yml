description: The following query identifies potential web shells in complomised legitimate endpoints through searching for newly created uri endpoints on servers that such behaviour is unusual.  The search discards events from hosts that routinely generate short lived end points.  This work expands on that done by ASD and NSA on webshells.
Search: ‘| datamodel Web search summariesonly=true
| search Web.uri_path=*
| stats earliest(_time) as firstSeen latest(_time) as lastSeen by host,Web.uri_path
| eval firstSeenDate=strftime(firstSeen,"%m/%d/%y")
| eval lastSeenDate=strftime(lastSeen,"%m/%d/%y")
| eval dateNow=strftime(now(),"%m/%d/%y")
| eval newEvent=if(firstSeenDate=dateNow AND lastSeenDate=dateNow,"true","false")
| eval age=strftime(lastSeen-firstSeen,"%d")
| eventstats count(age) as eventCount by host,Web.uri_path
| eventstats avg(age) as average by host
| eventstats stdev(age) as stdDev by host
| eventstats p20(age) as p20 by host
| eval average=round(average,0)
| eval stdDev=round(stdDev,0)
| eval low=if(average-stdDev<0 AND p20>average-stdDev,p20,average-stdDev)
| eval test=if(age<low,"true","false")
| search test="true" newEvent="true"
| dedup host,Web.uri_path
| table host,Web.uri_path,firstSeenDate,lastSeenDate,dateNow,newEvent,age,average,stdDev,p20,low,test’
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information from either local web server access logs or internal network proxy traffic.  Best results are from access log files.
Data needs to be correctly parsed into CIM format and incorporated into the SplunkES datamodels.  If the data is not in CIM or in the data models it will be necessary to modify the field names and initial search line to fit your situation.
The search is to be executed daily with completion prior to midnight.  It operates over the entire summary period (default 3 months) and reports only on events for the day executed.
known_false_positives: This search will detect instances where the creation and use of a new http endpoint and this is unusual, this is an characertstic for a webshell not a clear IOC.  This alert works best in aggregation such as the risk based alerting framework.
