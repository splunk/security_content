description: The following analytic detects the suspicious spawning of MSBuild.exe
  by Windows Script Host processes (cscript.exe or wscript.exe). This behavior is
  often associated with malware or adversaries executing malicious MSBuild processes
  via scripts on compromised hosts. The detection leverages Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process creation events where MSBuild is a
  child of script hosts. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt
  to execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, it could lead to unauthorized
  code execution, potentially compromising the host and allowing further malicious
  activities.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as developers do not spawn
  MSBuild via a WSH.
