name: Detect mshta inline hta execution

author: Bhavin Patel, Michael Haag, Splunk
type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies "mshta.exe" execution with inline protocol
  handlers. "JavaScript", "VBScript", and "About" are the only supported options when
  invoking HTA content directly on the command-line. The search will return the first
  time and last time these command-line arguments were used for these executions,
  as well as the target system, the user, process "mshta.exe" and its parent process.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_mshta` (Processes.process=*vbscript*
  OR Processes.process=*javascript* OR Processes.process=*about*) by Processes.user
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.dest  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_mshta_inline_hta_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
