description: The following analytic detects the execution of "mshta.exe" with inline
  protocol handlers such as "JavaScript", "VBScript", and "About". It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line arguments
  and process details. This activity is significant because mshta.exe can be exploited
  to execute malicious scripts, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code,
  escalate privileges, or establish persistence within the environment, posing a severe
  security risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_mshta` (Processes.process=*vbscript*
  OR Processes.process=*javascript* OR Processes.process=*about*) by Processes.user
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.parent_process_name

  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_mshta_inline_hta_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
