- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious parent process execution of commandline
  tool not in shell commandline. This technique was seen in FIN7 JSSLoader .net compile
  payload where it run ipconfig.exe and systeminfo.exe using .net application. This
  event cause some good TTP since those tool are commonly run in commandline not by
  another application. This TTP is a good indicator for application gather host information
  either an attacker or an automated tool made by admin.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  (Processes.process_name = "ipconfig.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "systeminfo.exe") AND NOT (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "cmd.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name = "powershell*" OR Processes.parent_process_name
  = "explorer.exe") by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process_id Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `cmdline_tool_not_executed_in_cmd_shell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network operator or admin may create this type of tool to gather
  host information
