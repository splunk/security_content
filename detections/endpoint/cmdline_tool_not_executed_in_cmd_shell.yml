type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search detects a suspicious process execution of a console tool/application executed
  with a parent process not matching CMD, PowerShell, or Explorer. This technique was seen in FIN7's
  JSSLoader .NET payload where it spawned ipconfig.exe and systeminfo.exe.  This event stands out as a
  TTP since these tools are commonly run with a command line or Explorer parent, and not by another
  application. This TTP is a good indicator for an attack gathering host information, but one possible
  false positive might be an automated tool used by a system administator.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  (Processes.process_name = "ipconfig.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "systeminfo.exe") AND NOT (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "cmd.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name = "powershell*" OR Processes.parent_process_name
  = "explorer.exe") by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process_id Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `cmdline_tool_not_executed_in_cmd_shell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may create this type of tool to gather
  host information
