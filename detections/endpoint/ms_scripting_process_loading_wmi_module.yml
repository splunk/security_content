type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious MS scripting process such as wscript.exe
  or cscript.exe that loading wmi module to process wmi query. This behavior was seen
  in FIN7 implant where it uses javascript to execute wmi query to parse host information
  that will send to its C2 server. this anomaly detections is a good initial step
  to hunt further a suspicious wmi query or wmi related events to the host that may
  give you good information regarding process that are commonly using wmi query or
  modules or might be an attacker using this technique.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode =7 Image IN ("*\\wscript.exe", "*\\cscript.exe") ImageLoaded
  IN ("*\\fastprox.dll", "*\\wbemdisp.dll", "*\\wbemprox.dll", "*\\wbemsvc.dll" ,
  "*\\wmiutils.dll", "*\\wbemcomn.dll") | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime count by Image EventCode process_name ProcessId ProcessGuid Computer
  ImageLoaded | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `ms_scripting_process_loading_wmi_module_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: automation scripting language may used by network operator
  to do ldap query.
