name: MS Scripting Process Loading WMI Module

description: The following analytic detects the loading of WMI modules by Microsoft
  scripting processes like wscript.exe or cscript.exe. It leverages Sysmon EventCode
  7 to identify instances where these scripting engines load specific WMI-related
  DLLs. This activity is significant because it can indicate the presence of malware,
  such as the FIN7 implant, which uses JavaScript to execute WMI queries for gathering
  host information to send to a C2 server. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
  allow attackers to collect sensitive system information and maintain persistence
  within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode =7 Image IN ("*\\wscript.exe", "*\\cscript.exe") ImageLoaded
  IN ("*\\fastprox.dll", "*\\wbemdisp.dll", "*\\wbemprox.dll", "*\\wbemsvc.dll" ,
  "*\\wmiutils.dll", "*\\wbemcomn.dll") | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime count by Image EventCode process_name ProcessId ProcessGuid Computer
  ImageLoaded | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `ms_scripting_process_loading_wmi_module_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: automation scripting language may used by network operator
  to do ldap query.
