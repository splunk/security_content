description: The following analytic detects the creation of a DLL file by an outlook.exe process in the AppData\Local\Microsoft\FORMS directory. This detection leverages data from the Endpoint.Processes and Endpoint.Filesystem datamodels, focusing on process and file creation events. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to exploit CVE-2024-21378, where a custom MAPI form loads a potentially malicious DLL. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, leading to further system compromise or data exfiltration.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
