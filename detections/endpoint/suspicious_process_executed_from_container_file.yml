description: This analytic identifies a suspicious process spawned by another process
  from within common container/archive file types. This technique was a common technique
  used by adversaries and malware to execute scripts or evade defenses. This TTP may
  detect some normal software installation or user behaviors where opening archive
  files is common.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Various business process or userland applications and behavior.
