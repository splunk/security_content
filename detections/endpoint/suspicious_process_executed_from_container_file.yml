description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process executed from
  within common container/archive file types such as ZIP, ISO, IMG, and others. It
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it is a common
  technique used by adversaries to execute scripts or evade defenses. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate
  privileges, or persist within the environment, posing a significant security risk.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Various business process or userland applications and behavior.
