description: This detection is designed to identify suspicious office documents
  that utilize macro code. Macro code is known to be a prevalent weaponization
  or attack vector for threat actors. This malicious macro code can be embedded in an office
  document as an attachment, potentially executing a malicious payload, downloading malware,
  or other malicious components. It is a good practice to disable macros by default
  to prevent the automatic execution of macro code when opening or closing office document
  files.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 process_name IN ("WINWORD.EXE", "EXCEL.EXE",
  "POWERPNT.EXE","onenote.exe","onenotem.exe","onenoteviewer.exe","onenoteim.exe","msaccess.exe")
  loaded_file_path IN ("*\\VBE7INTL.DLL","*\\VBE7.DLL", "*\\VBEUI.DLL") | stats min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(loaded_file) as loaded_file count
  by dest EventCode process_name process_guid | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `office_document_executing_macro_code_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and ImageLoaded (Like sysmon EventCode 7) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Also be sure to include those monitored dll to your own sysmon config.
known_false_positives: False positives may occur if legitimate office documents are
  executing macro code. Ensure to investigate the macro code and the command to be
  executed. If the macro code is benign, add the document name to the exclusion list.
  Some applications may legitimately load VBE7INTL.DLL, VBE7.DLL, or VBEUI.DLL.
