description: The following analytic identifies office documents executing macro code.
  It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to detect when processes like WINWORD.EXE or EXCEL.EXE
  load specific DLLs associated with macros (e.g., VBE7.DLL). This activity is significant
  because macros are a common attack vector for delivering malicious payloads, such
  as malware. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution,
  data exfiltration, or further compromise of the system. Disabling macros by default
  is recommended to mitigate this risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 process_name IN ("WINWORD.EXE", "EXCEL.EXE", "POWERPNT.EXE","onenote.exe","onenotem.exe","onenoteviewer.exe","onenoteim.exe","msaccess.exe")
  loaded_file_path IN ("*\\VBE7INTL.DLL","*\\VBE7.DLL", "*\\VBEUI.DLL") | stats min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(loaded_file) as loaded_file count by
  dest EventCode process_name process_guid | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `office_document_executing_macro_code_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and ImageLoaded (Like sysmon EventCode 7) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Also be sure to include those monitored dll to your own sysmon config.
known_false_positives: False positives may occur if legitimate office documents are
  executing macro code. Ensure to investigate the macro code and the command to be
  executed. If the macro code is benign, add the document name to the exclusion list.
  Some applications may legitimately load VBE7INTL.DLL, VBE7.DLL, or VBEUI.DLL.
