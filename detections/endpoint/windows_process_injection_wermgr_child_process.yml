description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious instance of wermgr.exe
  spawning a child process unrelated to error or fault handling. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process relationships
  and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it can indicate Qakbot
  malware, which injects malicious code into wermgr.exe to evade detection and execute
  malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker
  to conduct reconnaissance, execute arbitrary code, and persist within the network,
  posing a severe security risk.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
