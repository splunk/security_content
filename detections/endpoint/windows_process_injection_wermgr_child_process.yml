description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious instance of wermgr.exe spawning a child process unrelated to error or fault handling. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process relationships and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it can indicate Qakbot malware, which injects malicious code into wermgr.exe to evade detection and execute malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to conduct reconnaissance, execute arbitrary code, and persist within the network, posing a severe security risk.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
