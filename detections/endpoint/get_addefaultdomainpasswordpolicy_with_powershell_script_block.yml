status: production
type: Hunting
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy`
  PowerShell cmdlet, which is used to retrieve the password policy in a Windows domain.
  This detection leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify
  the specific command execution. Monitoring this activity is significant as it can
  indicate an attempt to gather domain policy information, which is often a precursor
  to further malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
  an attacker to understand password policies, aiding in password attacks or further
  domain enumeration.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText ="*Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy*"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest, UserID as user |  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `get_addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
