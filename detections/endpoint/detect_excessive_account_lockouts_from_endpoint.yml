description: This search identifies endpoints that have caused a relatively high number
  of account lockouts in a short period.
how_to_implement: "You must ingest your Windows security event logs in the `Change`\
  \ datamodel under the nodename is `Account_Management`, for this search to execute\
  \ successfully. Please consider updating the cron schedule and the count of lockouts\
  \ you want to monitor, according to your environment. \\\n **Splunk>Phantom Playbook\
  \ Integration**\\\nIf Splunk>Phantom is also configured in your environment, a Playbook\
  \ called \"Excessive Account Lockouts Enrichment and Response\" can be configured\
  \ to run when any results are found by this detection search. The Playbook executes\
  \ the Contextual and Investigative searches in this Story, conducts additional information\
  \ gathering on Windows endpoints, and takes a response action to shut down the affected\
  \ endpoint. To use this integration, install the Phantom App for Splunk `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/`,\
  \ add the correct hostname to the \"Phantom Instance\" field in the Adaptive Response\
  \ Actions when configuring this detection search, and set the corresponding Playbook\
  \ to active. \\\n(Playbook Link:`https://my.phantom.us/4.1/playbook/excessive-account-lockouts-enrichment-and-response/`).\\\

  cause a large number of account lockouts.
