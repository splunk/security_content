description: This analytic is to detect a loading of dll using regsvr32 application
  with silent parameter and dllinstall execution. This technique was seen in several
  RAT malware similar to remcos, njrat and adversaries to load their malicious DLL
  on the compromised machine. This TTP may executed by normal 3rd party application
  so it is better to pivot by the parent process, parent command-line and command-line
  of the file that execute this regsvr32.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` AND Processes.process="*/i*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.parent_process Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | where
  match(process,"(?i)[\-|\/][Ss]{1}") | `regsvr32_silent_and_install_param_dll_loading_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Other third part application may used this parameter but not
  so common in base windows environment.
