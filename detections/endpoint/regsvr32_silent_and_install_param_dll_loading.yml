description: The following analytic detects the loading of a DLL using the regsvr32
  application with the silent parameter and DLLInstall execution. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line
  arguments and parent process details. This activity is significant as it is commonly
  used by RAT malware like Remcos and njRAT to load malicious DLLs on compromised
  machines. If confirmed malicious, this technique could allow attackers to execute
  arbitrary code, maintain persistence, and further compromise the system.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` AND Processes.process="*/i*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.parent_process Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`

  match(process,"(?i)[\-|\/][Ss]{1}") | `regsvr32_silent_and_install_param_dll_loading_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Other third part application may used this parameter but not
  so common in base windows environment.
