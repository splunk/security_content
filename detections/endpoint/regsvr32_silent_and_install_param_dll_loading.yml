- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to detect a loading of dll using regsvr32 application
  with silent parameter and dllinstall execution. This technique was seen in several
  RAT malware similar to remcos, njrat and adversaries to load their malicious DLL
  on the compromised machine. This TTP may executed by normal 3rd party application
  so it is better to pivot by the parent process, parent command-line and command-line
  of the file that execute this regsvr32.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` AND Processes.process="*/i*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.parent_process Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | where
  match(process,"(?i)[\-|\/][Ss]{1}") | `regsvr32_silent_and_install_param_dll_loading_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Other third part application may used this parameter but not
  so common in base windows environment.
