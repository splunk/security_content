description: 'Detect a renamed instance of procdump.exe dumping the lsass process.
  This query looks for both -mm and -ma usage. -mm will produce a mini dump file and
  -ma will write a dump file with all process memory. Both are highly suspect and
  should be reviewed. Modify the query as needed.\

  During triage, confirm this is procdump.exe executing. If it is the first time a
  Sysinternals utility has been ran, it is possible there will be a -accepteula on
  the command line. Review other endpoint data sources for cross process (injection)
  into lsass.exe.'
search: '`sysmon` OriginalFileName=procdump  process_name!=procdump*.exe  EventID=1
  (CommandLine=*-ma* OR CommandLine=*-mm*) CommandLine=*lsass* | rename Computer as
  dest |  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, parent_process_name,
  process_name, OriginalFileName, CommandLine | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `dump_lsass_via_procdump_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
