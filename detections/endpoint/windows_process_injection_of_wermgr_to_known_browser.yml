name: Windows Process Injection Of Wermgr to Known Browser

type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies the suspicious remote thread execution of the wermgr.exe process into known browsers such as firefox.exe, chrome.exe, and others. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 8 logs to detect this behavior by monitoring SourceImage and TargetImage fields. This activity is significant because it is indicative of Qakbot malware, which injects malicious code into legitimate processes to steal information. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 SourceImage = "*\\wermgr.exe" TargetImage IN ("*\\firefox.exe", "*\\chrome.exe", "*\\iexplore.exe","*\\microsoftedgecp.exe") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage TargetImage SourceProcessGuid SourceProcessId StartAddress StartFunction TargetProcessGuid TargetProcessId  EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_process_injection_of_wermgr_to_known_browser_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the SourceImage, TargetImage, and EventCode executions from your endpoints related to create remote thread or injecting codes. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
