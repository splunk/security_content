name: Windows Process Injection Of Wermgr to Known Browser

status: production
type: TTP
description: This analytic identifies the suspicious Remote Thread execution of wermgr.exe
  process to "firefox.exe", "chrome.exe" and other known browsers. This technique
  was seen in Qakbot malware that executes its malicious code by injecting its code
  in legitimate Windows Operating System processes such as wermgr.exe to steal information
  in the compromised host. This TTP detection can be a good pivot to detect wermgr.exe
  process injected with qakbot code that tries to remote thread code execution in
  known browsers like firefox and edge which is not a common behavior of this wermgr.exe
  application.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 SourceImage = "*\\wermgr.exe" TargetImage IN ("*\\firefox.exe",
  "*\\chrome.exe", "*\\iexplore.exe","*\\microsoftedgecp.exe") | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage TargetImage SourceProcessGuid
  SourceProcessId StartAddress StartFunction TargetProcessGuid TargetProcessId  EventCode
  dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_process_injection_of_wermgr_to_known_browser_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the SourceImage, TargetImage, and EventCode executions from your endpoints
  related to create remote thread or injecting codes. If you are using Sysmon, you
  must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
