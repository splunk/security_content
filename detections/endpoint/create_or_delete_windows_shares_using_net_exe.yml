description: This search looks for the creation or deletion of hidden shares using
  net.exe.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.user) as
  user values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_net` by
  Processes.process Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.dest
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | search process=*share* | `create_or_delete_windows_shares_using_net_exe_filter` '
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Administrators often leverage net.exe to create or delete network
  shares. You should verify that the activity was intentional and is legitimate.
