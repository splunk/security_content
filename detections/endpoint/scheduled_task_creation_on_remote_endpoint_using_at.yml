description: This analytic looks for the execution of `at.exe` with command-line arguments
  utilized to create a Scheduled Task on a remote endpoint. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may abuse the Task Scheduler for lateral movement and remote code execution.
  The `at.exe` binary internally leverages the AT protocol which was deprecated starting
  with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 but may still work on previous versions of
  Windows. Furthermore, attackers may enable this protocol on demand by changing a
  sytem registry key.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=at.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=at.exe) (Processes.process=*\\\\*) by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `scheduled_task_creation_on_remote_endpoint_using_at_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may create scheduled tasks on remote systems,
  but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
