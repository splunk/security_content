description: 'The following analytic detects the creation of scheduled tasks on remote
  Windows endpoints using the at.exe command. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process creation events involving at.exe
  with remote command-line arguments. Identifying this activity is significant for
  a SOC as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code execution attempts by an
  attacker. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access,
  persistence, or execution of malicious code, potentially resulting in data theft
  or further compromise of the network.'
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=at.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=at.exe) (Processes.process=*\\\\*) by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `scheduled_task_creation_on_remote_endpoint_using_at_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may create scheduled tasks on remote systems,
  but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
