description: 'The following analytic detects the creation of suspicious tasks on a
  remote Windows endpoint using the at.exe command with command-line arguments. This
  technique is commonly used by red teams and adversaries for lateral movement and
  remote code execution. The at.exe binary leverages the deprecated AT protocol, which
  may still work on previous versions of Windows. Attackers can enable this protocol
  on demand by modifying a system registry key. It is important to consider potential
  false positives. While administrators may create scheduled tasks on remote systems,
  this activity is typically limited to a small set of hosts or users.

  Identifying the creation of scheduled tasks on remote endpoints is crucial for a
  Security Operations Center (SOC) because it indicates potential unauthorized activity
  or an attacker attempting to establish persistence or execute malicious code. The
  impact of a true positive can be significant, leading to unauthorized access, data
  theft, or other damaging outcomes. During triage, investigate the source and purpose
  of the scheduled task, inspect relevant on-disk artifacts, and analyze concurrent
  processes to identify the extent of the attack and take appropriate response actions.'

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=at.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=at.exe) (Processes.process=*\\\\*) by Processes.dest

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may create scheduled tasks on remote systems,
  but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
