name: Linux NOPASSWD Entry In Sudoers File

type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to look for suspicious command lines that may add entry
  to /etc/sudoers with NOPASSWD attribute in linux platform. This technique is commonly
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain elevated privilege
  to the targeted or compromised host. /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what
  commands users can execute on the machines and can also control whether user need
  a password to execute particular commands. This file is composed of aliases (basically
  variables) and user specifications.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*NOPASSWD:*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_nopasswd_entry_in_sudoers_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
