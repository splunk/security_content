description: This analytic is to look for suspicious command lines that may add entry
  to /etc/sudoers with NOPASSWD attribute in linux platform. This technique is commonly
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain elevated privilege
  to the targeted or compromised host. /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what
  commands users can execute on the machines and can also control whether user need
  a password to execute particular commands. This file is composed of aliases (basically
  variables) and user specifications.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*NOPASSWD:*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_nopasswd_entry_in_sudoers_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
