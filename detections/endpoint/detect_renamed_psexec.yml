datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of `PsExec.exe` being
  utilized on an endpoint. Most instances, it is highly probable to capture `Psexec.exe`
  or other SysInternal utility usage with the command-line argument of `-accepteula`.
  During triage, validate this is the legitimate version of `PsExec` by reviewing
  the PE metadata. In addition, review parallel processes for further suspicious behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name!=psexec.exe OR Processes.process_name!=psexec64.exe) AND Processes.original_file_name=psexec.c by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_renamed_psexec_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives should be present. It is possible some
  third party applications may use older versions of PsExec, filter as needed.
