description: The following analytic identifies instances where `PsExec.exe` has been
  renamed and executed on an endpoint. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and original file names. This activity
  is significant because renaming `PsExec.exe` is a common tactic to evade detection.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute commands remotely,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access, lateral movement, or further compromise
  of the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name!=psexec.exe
  AND Processes.process_name!=psexec64.exe) AND Processes.original_file_name=psexec.c

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives should be present. It is possible some
  third party applications may use older versions of PsExec, filter as needed.
