description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of `PsExec.exe` being
  utilized on an endpoint. Most instances, it is highly probable to capture `Psexec.exe`
  or other SysInternal utility usage with the command-line argument of `-accepteula`.
  During triage, validate this is the legitimate version of `PsExec` by reviewing
  the PE metadata. In addition, review parallel processes for further suspicious behavior.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name!=psexec.exe
  OR Processes.process_name!=psexec64.exe) AND Processes.original_file_name=psexec.c
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_renamed_psexec_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives should be present. It is possible some
  third party applications may use older versions of PsExec, filter as needed.
