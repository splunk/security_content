description: The following analytic detects file writes with extensions indicative of a SamSam ransomware attack. It leverages file-system activity data to identify file names ending in .stubbin, .berkshire, .satoshi, .sophos, or .keyxml. This activity is significant because SamSam ransomware is highly destructive, leading to file encryption and ransom demands. If confirmed malicious, the impact includes significant financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Immediate actions should include isolating affected systems, restoring files from backups, and investigating the attack source to prevent further incidents.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records file-system activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data-model node. If you are using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which you want to collect data.
known_false_positives: Because these extensions are not typically used in normal operations, you should investigate all results.
