description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments that utilize `Get-DomainComputer` to discover remote systems.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant
  as `Get-DomainComputer` is part of PowerView, a tool often used by adversaries for
  domain enumeration and situational awareness. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow attackers to map out the network, identify critical systems, and plan
  further attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="powershell.exe")
  (Processes.process=*Get-DomainComputer*) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use PowerView for troubleshooting.
