description: The following analytic identifies rundll32.exe loading setupapi.dll and
  iesetupapi.dll by calling the LaunchINFSection function on the command line. This
  particular technique will load script code from a file. Upon a successful execution,
  the following module loads may occur - clr.dll, jscript.dll and scrobj.dll. During
  investigation, identify script content origination. Generally, a child process will
  spawn from rundll32.exe, but that may be bypassed based on script code contents.
  Rundll32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. During
  investigation, review any network connections and obtain the script content executed.
  It's possible other files are on disk.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` Processes.process=*setupapi*

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use setupapi
  triggering a false positive.
