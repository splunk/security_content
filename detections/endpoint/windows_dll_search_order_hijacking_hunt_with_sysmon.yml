name: Windows DLL Search Order Hijacking Hunt with Sysmon

description: This hunting analytic identifies known Windows libraries
  potentially used in DLL search order hijacking or DLL Sideloading scenarios. Such cases
  may necessitate recompiling the DLL, relocating the DLL, or moving the vulnerable process. The
  query searches for any processes running outside of system32 or syswow64 directories. Certain libraries
  inherently operate from different application paths and must be added to the exclusion list
  as required. The lookup includes Microsoft native libraries cataloged in the
  Hijacklibs.net project.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 NOT (process_path IN ("*\\system32\\*", "*\\syswow64\\*","*\\winsxs\\*","*\\wbem\\*")) 
  | lookup hijacklibs library AS loaded_file OUTPUT islibrary 
  | search islibrary = True 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(process_name) as process_name by _time dest loaded_file | `windows_dll_search_order_hijacking_hunt_with_sysmon_filter`'
how_to_implement: The search is written against the latest Sysmon TA 4.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709. For this specific event ID 7, the sysmon TA will extract the ImageLoaded name to the loaded_file field which is used in the search to compare against the hijacklibs lookup. 
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on paths. Filter or add
  other paths to the exclusion as needed. Some applications may legitimately load libraries from non-standard paths.
