description: The following analytic identifies potential DLL search order hijacking
  or DLL sideloading by detecting known Windows libraries loaded from non-standard
  directories. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to monitor DLL loads and cross-references
  them with a lookup of known hijackable libraries. This activity is significant as
  it may indicate an attempt to execute malicious code by exploiting DLL search order
  vulnerabilities. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to gain code
  execution, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 NOT (process_path IN ("*\\system32\\*", "*\\syswow64\\*","*\\winsxs\\*","*\\wbem\\*"))
  | lookup hijacklibs library AS loaded_file OUTPUT islibrary | search islibrary =
  True | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(process_name)
  as process_name by _time dest loaded_file | `windows_dll_search_order_hijacking_hunt_with_sysmon_filter`'
how_to_implement: The search is written against the latest Sysmon TA 4.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709.
  For this specific event ID 7, the sysmon TA will extract the ImageLoaded name to
  the loaded_file field which is used in the search to compare against the hijacklibs
  lookup.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on paths. Filter or add
  other paths to the exclusion as needed. Some applications may legitimately load
  libraries from non-standard paths.
