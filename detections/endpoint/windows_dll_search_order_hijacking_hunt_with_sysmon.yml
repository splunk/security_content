name: Windows DLL Search Order Hijacking Hunt with Sysmon

status: production
type: Hunting
description: The following hunting analytic is an experimental query built against
  a accidental feature using the latest Sysmon TA 3.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709/)
  which maps the module load (ImageLoaded) to process_name. This analytic will deprecate
  once this is fixed. This hunting analytic identifies known libraries in Windows
  that may be used in a DLL search order hijack or DLL Sideloading setting. This may
  require recompiling the DLL, moving the DLL or moving the vulnerable process. The
  query looks for any running out of system32 or syswow64. Some libraries natively
  run out of other application paths and will need to be added to the exclusion as
  needed. The lookup is comprised of Microsoft native libraries identified within
  the Hijacklibs.net project.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 NOT (process_path IN ("*\\system32\\*", "*\\syswow64\\*","*\\winsxs\\*","*\\wbem\\*"))
  | lookup hijacklibs library AS process_name OUTPUT islibrary | search islibrary
  = True | rename Computer as dest process_name AS ImageLoaded process_path AS Module_Path
  | stats values(parent_process_name) count by _time dest ImageLoaded Module_Path
  | `windows_dll_search_order_hijacking_hunt_with_sysmon_filter`'
how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
  will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to
  work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on paths. Filter or add
  other paths to the exclusion as needed.
