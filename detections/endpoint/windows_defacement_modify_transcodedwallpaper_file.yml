description: The following analytic identifies a modification to the Transcodedwallpaper
  file in the wallpaper theme directory to change the wallpaper of the host machine.
  This technique was seen in adversaries attempting to deface or change the desktop
  wallpaper of the targeted host. During our testing, the common process that affects
  or changes the wallpaper if a user changes it via desktop personalized setting is
  explorer.exe.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_path !="*\\Windows\\Explorer.EXE" by _time span=1h Processes.process_id

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: 3rd part software application can change the wallpaper. Filter
  is needed.
