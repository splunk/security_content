description: The following analytic identifies modifications to the TranscodedWallpaper
  file in the wallpaper theme directory, excluding changes made by explorer.exe. This
  detection leverages the Endpoint.Processes and Endpoint.Filesystem data models to
  correlate process activity with file modifications. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate an adversary attempting to deface or change the desktop wallpaper
  of a targeted host, a tactic often used to signal compromise or deliver a message.
  If confirmed malicious, this could be a sign of unauthorized access and tampering,
  potentially leading to further system compromise or data exfiltration.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: 3rd part software application can change the wallpaper. Filter
  is needed.
