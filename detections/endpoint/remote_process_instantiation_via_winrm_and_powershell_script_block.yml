description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of PowerShell with arguments utilized to start a process
  on a remote endpoint by abusing the WinRM protocol. Specifically, this search looks
  for the abuse of the `Invoke-Command` commandlet. Red Teams and adversaries alike
  may abuse WinRM for lateral movement and remote code execution.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (Message="*Invoke-Command*" AND Message="*-ComputerName*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Message
  ComputerName User | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `remote_process_instantiation_via_winrm_and_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup instructions
  can be found https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WinRM and `Invoke-Command` to start
  a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use cases. This
  activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users. In certain environments,
  tuning may not be possible.
