- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Find-InterestingDomainAcl`
  cmdlet, part of the PowerView toolkit, using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104).
  This detection leverages logs to identify when this command is run, which is significant
  as adversaries may use it to find misconfigured or unusual Access Control Lists
  (ACLs) within a domain. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to identify privilege escalation opportunities or weak security configurations in
  Active Directory, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further exploitation.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*Find-InterestingDomainAcl*"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest, UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_find_interesting_acl_with_findinterestingdomainacl_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerSploit tools for legitimate
  reasons, filter as needed.
