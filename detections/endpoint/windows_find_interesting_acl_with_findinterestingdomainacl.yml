- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: This analytic leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to detect the execution of the `Find-InterestingDomainAcl` commandlet. `Find-InterestingDomainAcl` is part of PowerView, a PowerShell toolkit designed for Windows domain enumeration. Detecting the use of `Find-InterestingDomainAcl` is crucial as adversaries and Red Teams might employ it to identify unusual or misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs) within the domain. Such ACLs can provide attackers with insights into potential privilege escalation opportunities or weak security postures within Active Directory.

how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerSploit tools for legitimate reasons, filter as needed.
