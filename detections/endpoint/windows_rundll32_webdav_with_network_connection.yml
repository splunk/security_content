data_source: []
description: The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe with command-line
  arguments loading davclnt.dll and the davsetcookie function to access a remote WebDav
  instance. It uses data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, correlating
  process execution and network traffic data. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate exploitation of CVE-2023-23397, a known vulnerability. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to establish unauthorized remote connections, potentially
  leading to data exfiltration or further network compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on legitimate software,
  filtering may need to occur.
