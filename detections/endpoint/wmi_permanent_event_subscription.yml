description: |-
  The following analytic detects the creation of permanent event subscriptions using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which is used by attackers to achieve persistence in a compromised system. By creating a permanent event subscription, an attacker can run malicious scripts or binaries in response to specific system events that enables them to maintain access to the system undetected. The detection is made by using Sysmon Event ID 5 data to detect instances where the consumers of these events are not the expected "NTEventLogEventConsumer." The detection is important because it identifies unusual or unexpected subscription creation, which suggests that an attacker is attempting to achieve persistence within the environment and might be executing malicious scripts or binaries in response to specific system events. The impact of such an attack can be severe, potentially leading to data theft, ransomware, or other damaging outcomes. False positives might occur since False positives might occur since WMI event subscriptions can be used for legitimate purposes by system administrators. You must have a thorough understanding of WMI activity within the context of the monitored environment to effectively differentiate between legitimate and malicious activity.Next steps include investigating the associated scripts or binaries and identifying the source of the attack.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 5
search: '`wmi` EventCode=5861 Binding | rex field=Message "Consumer =\s+(?<consumer>[^;|^$]+)"
  | search consumer!="NTEventLogEventConsumer=\"SCM Event Log Consumer\"" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName, consumer,
  Message | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | rename ComputerName as dest | `wmi_permanent_event_subscription_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting the
  Windows WMI activity logs. This can be done by adding a stanza to inputs.conf on
  the system generating logs with a title of [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational].
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, administrators may use event subscriptions
  for legitimate purposes.
