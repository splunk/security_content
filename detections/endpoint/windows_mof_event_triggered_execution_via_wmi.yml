name: Windows MOF Event Triggered Execution via WMI

description: The following analytic detects the execution of MOFComp.exe loading a
  MOF file, often triggered by cmd.exe or powershell.exe, or from unusual paths like
  User Profile directories. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data,
  focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line executions. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate an attacker using WMI for persistence or lateral
  movement. If confirmed malicious, it could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code, maintain persistence, or escalate privileges within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("cmd.exe", "powershell.exe") Processes.process_name=mofcomp.exe) OR (Processes.process_name=mofcomp.exe
  Processes.process IN ("*\\AppData\\Local\\*","*\\Users\\Public\\*")) by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_mof_event_triggered_execution_via_wmi_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present from automation based applications
  (SCCM), filtering may be required. In addition, break the query out based on volume
  of usage. Filter process names or file paths.
