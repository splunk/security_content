description: The following anaytic identifies MOFComp.exe loading a MOF file. The
  Managed Object Format (MOF) compiler parses a file containing MOF statements and
  adds the classes and class instances defined in the file to the WMI repository.
  Typically, MOFComp.exe does not reach out to the public internet or load a MOF file
  from User Profile paths. A filter and consumer is typically registered in WMI. Review
  parallel processes and query WMI subscriptions to gather artifacts. The default
  path of mofcomp.exe is C:\Windows\System32\wbem.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present from automation based applications
  (SCCM), filtering may be required. In addition, break the query out based on volume
  of usage. Filter process names or f
