description: The following anaytic identifies MOFComp.exe loading a MOF file. The
  Managed Object Format (MOF) compiler parses a file containing MOF statements and
  adds the classes and class instances defined in the file to the WMI repository.
  Typically, MOFComp.exe does not reach out to the public internet or load a MOF file
  from User Profile paths. A filter and consumer is typically registered in WMI. Review
  parallel processes and query WMI subscriptions to gather artifacts. The default
  path of mofcomp.exe is C:\Windows\System32\wbem.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present from automation based applications
  (SCCM), filtering may be required. In addition, break the query out based on volume
  of usage. Filter process names or f
