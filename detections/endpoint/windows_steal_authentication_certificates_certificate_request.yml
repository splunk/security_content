status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects when a new certificate is requested from
  Certificate Services - AD CS. It leverages Event ID 4886, which indicates that a
  certificate request has been received. This activity is significant because unauthorized
  certificate requests can be part of credential theft or lateral movement tactics.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use the certificate to impersonate users,
  gain unauthorized access to resources, or establish persistent access within the
  environment. Monitoring and correlating this event with other suspicious activities
  is crucial for identifying potential security incidents.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4886
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4886 | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest, name, Requester, action, Attributes | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_steal_authentication_certificates_certificate_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, enhanced Audit Logging must be enabled
  on AD CS and within Group Policy Management for CS server. See Page 115 of first
  reference.
known_false_positives: False positives will be generated based on normal certificate
  requests. Leave enabled to generate Risk, as this is meant to be an anomaly analytic.
