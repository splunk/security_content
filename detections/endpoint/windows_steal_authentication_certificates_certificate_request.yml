type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies when a new certificate is requested
  against the Certificate Services - AD CS. By its very nature this is not malicious,
  but should be tracked and correlated with other events related to certificate requests.
  When an account requests a certificate, the CA generates event ID (EID) 4886 "Certificate
  Services received a certificate request".
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4886
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4886 | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest, name, Requester, action, Attributes | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_steal_authentication_certificates_certificate_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, enhanced Audit Logging must be enabled
  on AD CS and within Group Policy Management for CS server. See Page 115 of first
  reference.
known_false_positives: False positives will be generated based on normal certificate
  requests. Leave enabled to generate Risk, as this is meant to be an anomaly analytic.
