description: The following analytic identifies the use of remote access software within the environment. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. This detection is significant as unauthorized remote access tools can be used by adversaries to maintain persistent access to compromised systems. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to remotely control systems, exfiltrate data, or further infiltrate the network. Review the identified software to ensure it is authorized and take action against any unauthorized utilities.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be found. Filter as needed and create higher fidelity analytics based off banned remote access software.
