description: The following analytic identifies a genuine Domain Controller (DC) promotion
  event by detecting when a computer assigns itself the necessary Service Principal
  Names (SPNs) to function as a domain controller. It leverages Windows Security Event
  Code 4742 to monitor existing domain controllers for these changes. This activity
  is significant as it can help identify rogue DCs added to the network, which could
  indicate a DCShadow attack. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to manipulate Active Directory, leading to potential privilege escalation and persistent
  access within the environment.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  eventcode `4742`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Computer Account
  Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
