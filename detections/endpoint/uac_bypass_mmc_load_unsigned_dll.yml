description: This search is to detect a suspicious loaded unsigned dll by MMC.exe
  application. This technique is commonly seen in attacker that tries to bypassed
  UAC feature or gain privilege escalation. This is done by modifying some CLSID registry
  that will trigger the mmc.exe to load the dll path
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  ImageLoaded = "*.dll" Image = "*\\mmc.exe" Signed=false
  Company != "Microsoft Corporation" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded Signed ProcessId OriginalFileName dest EventCode
  Company | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `uac_bypass_mmc_load_unsigned_dll_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: unknown. all of the dll loaded by mmc.exe is microsoft signed
  dll.
