datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious process command line, 
  where WMI is performing an event query looking for running processes or running
  services. This technique is commonly found where the adversary will identify services
  and system information on the compromised machine. During triage, review parallel
  processes within the same timeframe. Review the full script block to identify other
  related artifacts.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_wmic` Processes.process IN ("*process list*", "*service list*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid 
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_wmi_process_and_service_list_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: netowrk administrator or IT may execute this command for auditing processes and services.
