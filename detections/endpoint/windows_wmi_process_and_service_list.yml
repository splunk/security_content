description: The following analytic identifies suspicious WMI command lines querying
  for running processes or services. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific process and command-line events. This
  activity is significant as adversaries often use WMI to gather system information
  and identify services on compromised machines. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could allow attackers to map out the system, identify critical services, and plan
  further attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation or persistence within
  the environment.

  IN ("*process list*", "*service list*") by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: netowrk administrator or IT may execute this command for auditing
  processes and services.
