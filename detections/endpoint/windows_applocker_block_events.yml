description: The following analytic utilizes Windows AppLocker event logs to generate risk based on blocks related to AppLocker policy violations. The analytic is designed to identify attempts to bypass application restrictions.
search: '`applocker`  EventCode IN (8007, 8004, 8022, 8025, 8029, 8040)
  | spath input=UserData_Xml | rename RuleAndFileData.* as *, TargetUser as user, Computer as dest
  | lookup applockereventcodes EventCode OUTPUT Description
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, PolicyName, RuleId, user, TargetProcessId, FilePath, FullFilePath
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_applocker_block_events_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, you must be ingesting Windows AppLocker logs into Splunk. Ensure proper logging is setup for AppLocker and data is being ingested into Splunk.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately use AppLocker to allow applications.
