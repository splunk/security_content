description: The following analytic detects attempts to bypass application restrictions
  by identifying Windows AppLocker policy violations. It leverages Windows AppLocker
  event logs, specifically EventCodes 8007, 8004, 8022, 8025, 8029, and 8040, to pinpoint
  blocked actions. This activity is significant for a SOC as it highlights potential
  unauthorized application executions, which could indicate malicious intent or policy
  circumvention. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to
  execute unauthorized applications, potentially leading to further system compromise
  or data exfiltration.
search: '`applocker`  EventCode IN (8007, 8004, 8022, 8025, 8029, 8040) | spath input=UserData_Xml
  | rename RuleAndFileData.* as *, TargetUser as user, Computer as dest  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by dest, PolicyName, RuleId, user, TargetProcessId, FilePath, FullFilePath, EventCode
  | lookup applockereventcodes EventCode OUTPUT Description | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_applocker_block_events_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, you must be ingesting Windows AppLocker
  logs into Splunk. Ensure proper logging is setup for AppLocker and data is being
  ingested into Splunk.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately use AppLocker to allow applications.
