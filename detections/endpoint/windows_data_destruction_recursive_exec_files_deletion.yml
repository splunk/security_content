description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process recursively deleting
  files in a compromised host. This behavior was seen in several destructive malware,
  wiper like caddy wiper, doublezero, and now swiftslicer that delete or overwrite
  files with random generated strings to make it unrecoverable. This analytic can
  also catch a possible recursive file write on multiple files using Sysmon Event
  23. Sysmon treats the modified file as a deleted one as soon as it was overwritten.
  This analytic can be a good indicator that a possible destructive malware is running
  in a host machine or a big software application is being uninstalled.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 23
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=23  TargetFilename IN ("*.exe", "*.sys", "*.dll") | bin
  _time span=2m | stats values(TargetFilename) as deleted_files min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime count by dest user EventCode Image ProcessID | where
  count >=500 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_data_destruction_recursive_exec_files_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the deleted target file name, process name and process id  from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: uninstall a big software application may trigger this detection.
  Filter is needed.
