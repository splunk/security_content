description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process recursively deleting files in compromised host. 
  This behavior was seen in several destructive malware, wiper like caddy wiper, doublezero, and now swiftslicer that delete or 
  overwrite files with random generated strings to make it unrecoverable. This analytic can also catch a possible recursive file write on multiple files 
  using Sysmon Event 23. Sysmon treat the modified file as deleted one as soon as it was overwriten. This analytic can be a good indicator that a possible 
  destructive malware is running in a host machine or a big software application is being uninstalled.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=23  TargetFilename IN ("*.exe", "*.sys", "*.dll") 
  | bin _time span=2m  
  | stats values(TargetFilename) as deleted_files min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Computer user EventCode Image ProcessID 
  | where count >=500 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_data_destruction_recursive_exec_files_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the deleted target file name, process name and process id  from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: uninstall a big software application may trigger this detection. Filter is needed.
