description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of Windows Curl.exe uploading
  a file to a remote destination. \

  `-T` or `--upload-file` is used when a file is to be uploaded to a remotge destination.
  \

  `-d` or `--data` POST is the HTTP method that was invented to send data to a receiving
  web application, and it is, for example, how most common HTML forms on the web work.
  \

  HTTP multipart formposts are done with `-F`, but this appears to not be compatible
  with the Windows version of Curl. Will update if identified adversary tradecraft.
  \

  Adversaries may use one of the three methods based on the remote destination and
  what they are attempting to upload (zip vs txt). During triage, review parallel
  processes for further behavior. In addition, identify if the upload was successful
  in network logs. If a file was uploaded, isolate the endpoint and review.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint_Processess` datamodel.
known_false_positives: False positives may be limited to source control applications
  and may be required to be filtered out.
