description: 'The following analytic detects the use of the Windows InstallUtil.exe
  binary with the `/u` (uninstall) switch, which can execute code while bypassing
  application control. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line executions.
  This activity is significant because it can indicate an attempt to execute malicious
  code without administrative privileges. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could
  achieve code execution, potentially leading to further system compromise or persistence
  within the environment.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives should be present. Filter as needed
  by parent process or application.
