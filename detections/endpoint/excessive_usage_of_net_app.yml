status: production
type: Anomaly
description: This analytic identifies excessive usage of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` within
  a bucket of time (1 minute). This behavior was seen in a Monero incident where the
  adversary attempts to create many users, delete and disable users as part of its
  malicious behavior.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: unknown. Filter as needed. Modify the time span as needed.
