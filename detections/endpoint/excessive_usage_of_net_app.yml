description: This analytic identifies excessive usage of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` within
  a bucket of time (1 minute). This behavior was seen in a Monero incident where the
  adversary attempts to create many users, delete and disable users as part of its
  malicious behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "net.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "net1.exe" by Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.dest Processes.user _time span=1m | where count >=10 | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_usage_of_net_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: unknown. Filter as needed. Modify the time span as needed.
