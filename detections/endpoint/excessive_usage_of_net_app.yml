datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic identifies excessive usage of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` within
  a bucket of time (1 minute). This behavior was seen in a Monero incident where the
  adversary attempts to create many users, delete and disable users as part of its
  malicious behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_net` by Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.dest Processes.user
  _time span=1m | where count >=10 | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_usage_of_net_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: unknown. Filter as needed. Modify the time span as needed.
