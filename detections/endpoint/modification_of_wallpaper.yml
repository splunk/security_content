description: This analytic identifies suspicious modification of registry to deface
  or change the wallpaper of a compromised machines as part of its payload. This technique
  was commonly seen in ransomware like REVIL where it create a bitmap file contain
  a note that the machine was compromised and make it as a wallpaper.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '`sysmon` EventCode =13  (TargetObject IN ("*\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper","*\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\WallpaperStyle") AND Image != "*\\explorer.exe") 
  OR (TargetObject IN ("*\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper","*\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\WallpaperStyle") AND Details IN ("*\\temp\\*", "*\\users\\public\\*")) 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Image TargetObject Details Computer process_guid process_id user_id 
  | rename Computer as dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `modification_of_wallpaper_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Image, TargetObject registry key, registry Details from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: 3rd party tool may used to changed the wallpaper of the machine
