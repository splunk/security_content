description: The following analytic detects the modification of registry keys related
  to the desktop wallpaper settings. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 13 to identify
  changes to the "Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper" and "Control Panel\\Desktop\\WallpaperStyle"
  registry keys, especially when the modifying process is not explorer.exe or involves
  suspicious file paths like temp or public directories. This activity is significant
  as it can indicate ransomware behavior, such as the REVIL ransomware, which changes
  the wallpaper to display a ransom note. If confirmed malicious, this could signify
  a compromised machine and the presence of ransomware, leading to potential data
  encryption and extortion.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '`sysmon` EventCode =13  (TargetObject IN ("*\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper","*\\Control
  Panel\\Desktop\\WallpaperStyle") AND Image != "*\\explorer.exe") OR (TargetObject
  IN ("*\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper","*\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\WallpaperStyle")
  AND Details IN ("*\\temp\\*", "*\\users\\public\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Image TargetObject Details Computer
  process_guid process_id user_id | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `modification_of_wallpaper_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Image, TargetObject registry key, registry Details from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: 3rd party tool may used to changed the wallpaper of the machine
