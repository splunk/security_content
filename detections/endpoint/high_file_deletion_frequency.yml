description: This search looks for high frequency of file deletion relative to process
  name and process id. These events usually happen when the ransomware tries to encrypt
  the files with the ransomware file extensions and sysmon treat the original files
  to be deleted as soon it was replace as encrypted data.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=23 TargetFilename IN ("*\.cmd", "*\.ini","*\.gif", "*\.jpg",
  "*\.jpeg", "*\.db", "*\.ps1", "*\.doc*", "*\.xls*", "*\.ppt*", "*\.bmp","*\.zip",
  "*\.rar", "*\.7z", "*\.chm", "*\.png", "*\.log", "*\.vbs", "*\.js") | stats values(TargetFilename)
  as deleted_files min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Computer
  user EventCode Image ProcessID |where count >=100 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `high_file_deletion_frequency_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the deleted target file name, process name and process id  from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: user may delete bunch of pictures or files in a folder.
