description: The following analytic detects the execution of `dsquery.exe` with the
  `computer` argument, which is used to discover remote systems within a domain. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process names and command-line arguments. Remote system discovery is significant
  as it indicates potential reconnaissance activities by adversaries or Red Teams
  to map out network resources and Active Directory structures. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could lead to further exploitation, lateral movement, and unauthorized
  access to critical systems within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="dsquery.exe")
  (Processes.process="*computer*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
