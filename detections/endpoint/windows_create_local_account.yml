description: The following analytic identifies a new local user account added to a
  computer. Note that, this should be restricted to critical assets.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(All_Changes.result_id) as
  result_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Change
  where All_Changes.result_id=4720 by All_Changes.user All_Changes.dest All_Changes.result
  All_Changes.action | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `windows_create_local_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: 'This search requires you to have enabled your Group Management
  Audit Logs in your Local Windows Security Policy and be ingesting those logs.  More
  information on how to enable them can be found here: http://whatevernetworks.com/auditing-group-membership-changes-in-active-directory/'
known_false_positives: It is possible that an administrator created the account. Verifying
  activity with an administrator is advised. This analytic is set to anomaly to allow
  for risk to be added. Filter and tune as needed. Restrict to critical infrastructure
  to reduce any volume.
