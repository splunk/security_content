description: This analytic will identify suspicious process of cscript.exe where it
  tries to execute javascript using jscript.encode CLSID (COM OBJ). This technique
  was seen in ransomware (reddot ransomware) where it execute javascript with this
  com object with combination of amsi disabling technique.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "cscript.exe"
  Processes.process="*-e:{F414C262-6AC0-11CF-B6D1-00AA00BBBB58}*" by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process Processes.process_id
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `execute_javascript_with_jscript_com_clsid_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
