description: 'The following analytic identifies a source host failing to authenticate
  against a remote host with multiple users. This behavior could represent an adversary
  performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment to
  obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Event 4625 documents each and every
  failed attempt to logon to the local computer. This event generates on domain controllers,
  member servers, and workstations. Logon Type 3 describes an remote authentication
  attempt.\

  The detection calculates the standard deviation for each host and leverages the
  3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number of users. To customize this
  analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket` span time and the
  calculation of the `upperBound` field. This logic can be used for real time security
  monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.\

  This detection will trigger on the host that is the target of the password spraying
  attack. This could be a domain controller as well as a member server or workstation.\

  The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by
  providing fields like source process name, source account and attempted user accounts.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as as well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid users against
  a remote host is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive
  scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, remote administration
  tools, missconfigyred systems, etc.
