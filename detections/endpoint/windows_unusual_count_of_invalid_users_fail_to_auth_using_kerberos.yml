description: 'The following analytic identifies a source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with multiple invalid domain users using the Kerberos protocol. It leverages Event
  ID 4768, which is generated when the Key Distribution Center issues a Kerberos Ticket
  Granting Ticket (TGT) and detects failure code 0x6, indicating the user is not found
  in the Kerberos database. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password
  Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access and potential
  privilege escalation within the Active Directory environment.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple invalid domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, multi-user systems and missconfigured
  systems.
