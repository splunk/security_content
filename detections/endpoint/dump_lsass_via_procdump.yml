description: 'The following analytic detects the use of procdump.exe to dump the LSASS
  process, specifically looking for the -mm and -ma command-line arguments. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names,
  command-line executions, and parent processes. This activity is significant because
  dumping LSASS can expose sensitive credentials, posing a severe security risk. If
  confirmed malicious, an attacker could obtain credentials, escalate privileges,
  and move laterally within the network, leading to potential data breaches and further
  compromise of the environment.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: None identified.
