description: This search is to detect a modification to registry to enable rdp to
  a machine with different port number. This technique was seen in some atttacker
  tries to do lateral movement and remote access to a compromised machine to gain
  control of it.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Registry.registry_key_name)
  as registry_key_name values(Registry.registry_path) as registry_path min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path="*HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal
  Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp*" Registry.registry_value_name = "PortNumber" by Registry.dest
  Registry.user Registry.registry_value_name | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `enable_rdp_in_other_port_number_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
