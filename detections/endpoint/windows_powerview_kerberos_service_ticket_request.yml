description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the execution of the `Get-DomainSPNTicket` commandlets with specific
  parameters. This commandlet is a part of PowerView, a PowerShell tool used to perform
  enumeration and discovery on Windows Active Directory networks. As the name suggests,
  this commandlet is used to request the kerberos ticket for a specified service principal
  name (SPN). Once the ticket is received, it may be cracked using password cracking
  tools like hashcat to extract the password of the SPN account. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may leverage PowerView and these commandlets to identify accounts that can
  be attacked with the Kerberoasting technique.
data_source:
- Powershell 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText=*Get-DomainSPNTicket* | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_powerview_kerberos_service_ticket_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic requires PowerShell operational logs to be
  imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or add index.
  This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: False positive may include Administrators using PowerView for
  troubleshooting and management.
