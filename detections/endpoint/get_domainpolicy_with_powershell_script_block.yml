description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-DomainPolicy`
  cmdlet using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). It leverages logs
  capturing script block text to identify attempts to obtain the password policy in
  a Windows domain. This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance
  efforts by adversaries or Red Teams to gather domain policy information, which is
  crucial for planning further attacks. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
  lead to detailed knowledge of domain security settings, aiding in privilege escalation
  or lateral movement within the network.

- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText ="*Get-DomainPolicy*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Opcode Computer UserID EventCode
  ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`

how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
