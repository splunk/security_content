description: The following analytic identifies when either a global catalog SPN or a DRS RPC SPN are temporarily added to an Active Directory computer object, both of which can be evidence of a DCShadow attack.  
  DCShadow allows an attacker who has obtained privileged access to register a rogue Domain Controller (DC). Once registered, the rogue DC may be able to inject
  and replicate changes into the AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys. This technique was initially released in 2018 by security researchers Benjamin Delpy and Vincent Le Toux.
  No event logs are written for changes to AD attributes, allowing for stealthy backdoors to be implanted in the domain, or metadata such as timestamps overwritten to cover tracks.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting eventcode 
 `5136`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes` 
 within `DS Access` needs to be enabled, alongside a SACL for `everybody` to 
 `Write All Properties` applied to the domain root and all descendant objects.
