- Endpoint
description: 'This search looks for system processes that typically execute from `C:\Windows\System32\`
  or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`.  This may indicate a malicious process that is trying
  to hide as a legitimate process.\

  This detection utilizes a lookup that is deduped `system32` and `syswow64` directories
  from Server 2016 and Windows 10.\

  During triage, review the parallel processes - what process moved the native Windows
  binary? identify any artifacts on disk and review. If a remote destination is contacted,
  what is the reputation?'
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_path !="C:\\Windows\\System32*"
  Processes.process_path !="C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_hash | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `is_windows_system_file`
  | `system_processes_run_from_unexpected_locations_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: This detection may require tuning based on third party applications
  utilizing native Windows binaries in non-standard paths.
