description: 'This search looks for system processes that typically execute from `C:\Windows\System32\`
  or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`.  This may indicate a malicious process that is trying
  to hide as a legitimate process.\

  This detection utilizes a lookup that is deduped `system32` and `syswow64` directories
  from Server 2016 and Windows 10.\

  During triage, review the parallel processes - what process moved the native Windows
  binary? identify any artifacts on disk and review. If a remote destination is contacted,
  what is the reputation?'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_path !="C:\\Windows\\System32*"
  Processes.process_path !="C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64*" by Processes.dest Processes.user

  | `system_processes_run_from_unexpected_locations_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This detection may require tuning based on third party applications
  utilizing native Windows binaries in non-standard paths.
