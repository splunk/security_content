description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for non-admin accounts with duplicate password risk, 
  identifying instances where multiple non-admin users share the same password. This practice weakens security and increases 
  the potential for unauthorized access. Addressing these alerts is essential to ensure each user account has a unique, 
  strong password, thereby enhancing overall security and protecting sensitive information.

how_to_implement: To implement crowdstrike:identities logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, 
  authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "crowdstrike:identities" event stream. 
  Process and store the logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.
