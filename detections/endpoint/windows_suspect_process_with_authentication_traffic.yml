description: >-
  This analytic identifies executables running from public or temporary locations that are communicating over windows domain
  authentication ports/protocol. The ports/protocols include LDAP(389), LDAPS(636), and Kerberos(88). Authentications from applications 
  running from user controlled locations may not be malicious, however actors often attempt to access domain resources after initial 
  compromise from executables in these locations.

how_to_implement: >-
  To implement this analytic, Sysmon should be installed in the environment and generating network events for 
  userland and/or known public writable locations.
known_false_positives: >-
  Known applications running from these locations for legitimate purposes. Targeting only kerberos (port 88)
  may significantly reduce noise.
