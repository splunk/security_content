description: The following analytic detects executables running from public or temporary locations that are communicating over Windows domain authentication ports/protocols such as LDAP (389), LDAPS (636), and Kerberos (88). It leverages network traffic data to identify processes originating from user-controlled directories. This activity is significant because legitimate applications rarely run from these locations and attempt domain authentication, making it a potential indicator of compromise. If confirmed malicious, attackers could leverage this to access domain resources, potentially leading to further exploitation and lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, Sysmon should be installed in the environment and generating network events for  userland and/or known public writable locations.
known_false_positives: Known applications running from these locations for legitimate purposes. Targeting only kerberos (port 88) may significantly reduce noise.
