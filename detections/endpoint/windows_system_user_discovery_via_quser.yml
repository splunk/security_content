description: The following analytic detects the execution of the Windows OS tool quser.exe,
  commonly used to gather information about user sessions on a Remote Desktop Session
  Host server. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. Monitoring this activity is crucial
  as quser.exe is often abused by post-exploitation tools like winpeas, used in ransomware
  attacks to enumerate user sessions. If confirmed malicious, attackers could leverage
  this information to further compromise the system, maintain persistence, or escalate
  privileges.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this command tool to audit RDP
  access of user in specific network or host.
