description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS quser.exe tool. 
  This tool is being abused or used by several post exploitation tool such as winpeas that being used by ransomware prestige 
  to display or gather information about user sessions on a Remote Desktop Session Host server. This command can 
  find out if a specific user is logged on to a specific Remote Desktop Session Host server. This tool can retrieve some RDP information that can 
  be use by attacker for further attack like Name of the user , Name of the session on the Remote Desktop Session Host server, Session ID, 
  State of the session (active or disconnected), Idle time (the number of minutes since the last keystroke or mouse movement at the session)
  and Date and time the user logged on.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name="quser.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name = "quser.exe" 
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_system_user_discovery_via_quser_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this command tool to audit RDP access of user in specific network or host.
