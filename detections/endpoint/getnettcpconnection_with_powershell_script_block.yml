description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-NetTcpconnection`
  PowerShell cmdlet using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This cmdlet
  lists network connections on a system, which adversaries may use for situational
  awareness and Active Directory discovery. Monitoring this activity is crucial as
  it can indicate reconnaissance efforts by an attacker. If confirmed malicious, this
  behavior could allow an attacker to map the network, identify critical systems,
  and plan further attacks, potentially leading to data exfiltration or lateral movement
  within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText = "*Get-NetTcpconnection*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Opcode Computer
  UserID EventCode ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `getnettcpconnection_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this PowerShell commandlet
  for troubleshooting.
