description: The following analytic detects unauthorized access to Outlook credentials
  stored in the Windows registry. It leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically
  EventCode 4663, to identify access attempts to registry paths associated with Outlook
  profiles. This activity is significant as it may indicate attempts to steal sensitive
  email credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access to email accounts. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information,
  impersonate users, or execute further unauthorized actions within Outlook, posing
  a significant security risk.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 object_file_path IN ("*\\Profiles\\Outlook\\9375CFF0413111d3B88A00104B2A6676*",
  "*\\Windows Messaging Subsystem\\Profiles\\9375CFF0413111d3B88A00104B2A6676*") AND
  process_name != *\\outlook.exe | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by object_file_name object_file_path process_name process_path  process_id
  EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_unsecured_outlook_credentials_access_in_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: third party software may access this outlook registry.
