description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious query on outlook credentials registry in Windows OS registry. 
  typically refers to user profiles associated with Microsoft Outlook. Within this key, Outlook stores configuration settings, 
  including account information such as email addresses, server details, and authentication credentials. Accessing or modifying 
  this registry key can potentially compromise users' email security, making it a target for attackers seeking to steal sensitive 
  information or execute unauthorized actions within Outlook. This anomaly detection is a good pivot to catch possible Trojan Stealer or RAT 
  that tries to steal sensitive information to its targeted host.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: third party software may access this outlook registry.
