description: The following analytic detects the export of a certificate from the Windows
  Certificate Store. It leverages the Certificates Lifecycle log channel, specifically
  event ID 1007, to identify this activity. Monitoring certificate exports is crucial
  as certificates can be used for authentication to VPNs or private resources. If
  malicious actors export certificates, they could potentially gain unauthorized access
  to sensitive systems or data, leading to significant security breaches.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log CertificateServicesClient 1007
search: '`certificateservices_lifecycle` EventCode=1007 | xmlkv UserData_Xml | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, SubjectName, UserData_Xml
  | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_export_certificate_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, you must collect Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System/Operational
  or Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-User/Operational.
known_false_positives: False positives may be generated based on an automated process
  or service that exports certificates on the regular. Review is required before setting
  to alert. Monitor for abnormal processes performing an export.
