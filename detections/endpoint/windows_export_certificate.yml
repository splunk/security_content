description: The following analytic identifies when a certificate is exported from
  the Windows Certificate Store. This analytic utilizes the Certificates Lifecycle
  log channel event ID 1007. EventID 1007 is focused on the Export of a certificate
  from the local certificate store. In addition, review the ProcessName field as it
  will help to determine automation/Admin or adversary extracting the certificate.
  Depending on the organization, the certificate may be used for authentication to
  the VPN or private resources.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '`certificateservices_lifecycle` EventCode=1007 | xmlkv UserData_Xml | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, SubjectName, UserData_Xml
  | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_export_certificate_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, you must collect Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System/Operational
  or Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-User/Operational.
known_false_positives: False positives may be generated based on an automated process
  or service that exports certificates on the regular. Review is required before setting
  to alert. Monitor for abnormal processes performing an export.
