type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The search looks for the Registry Key DisableAntiSpyware set to disable.
  This is consistent with Ryuk infections across a fleet of endpoints. This particular
  behavior is typically executed when an ransomware actor gains access to an endpoint
  and beings to perform execution. Usually, a batch (.bat) will be executed and multiple
  registry and scheduled task modifications will occur. During triage, review parallel
  processes and identify any further file modifications. Endpoint should be isolated.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_value_name="DisableAntiSpyware"
  AND Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001" by Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_value_data | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `windows_disableantispyware_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
