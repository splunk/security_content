description: The following analytic identifies instances where the Windows Explorer
  process (explorer.exe) is executed with a URL in its command line. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  execution logs. This activity is significant because adversaries, such as those
  using DCRat malware, may abuse explorer.exe to open URLs with the default browser,
  which is an uncommon and suspicious behavior. If confirmed malicious, this technique
  could allow attackers to download and execute malicious payloads, leading to potential
  system compromise and further malicious activities.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on legitimate applications
  or third party utilities. Filter out any additional parent process names.
