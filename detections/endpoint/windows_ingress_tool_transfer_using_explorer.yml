description: The following analytic detects an explorer.exe with a possible url link process command line on it.
  Explorer.exe is known windows process that handle start menu, taskbar ,desktop and file manager. 
  So many threat actor abuses this process like DCRat malware, where it tries to open the url link with the default process browser application 
  in the target host by putting the url link as a parameter on explorer.exe process. This anomaly detection might be a good pivot to check 
  which user and how this process was executed, what is the parent process and what is the url link. This technique is not so common way to open an url link.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name = explorer.exe OR Processes.original_file_name = explorer.exe) AND NOT (Processes.parent_process_name IN("userinit.exe", "svchost.exe")) Processes.process IN ("* http://*", "* https://*")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
