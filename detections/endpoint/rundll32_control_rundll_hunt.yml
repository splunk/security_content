description: The following analytic identifies instances of rundll32.exe executing
  with `Control_RunDLL` in the command line, which is indicative of loading a .cpl
  or other file types. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments. This
  activity is significant as rundll32.exe can be exploited to execute malicious Control
  Panel Item files, potentially linked to CVE-2021-40444. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain
  persistence within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` Processes.process=*Control_RunDLL*  by

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This is a hunting detection, meant to provide a understanding
  of how voluminous control_rundll is within the environment.
