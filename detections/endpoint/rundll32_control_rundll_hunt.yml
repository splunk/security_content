type: Hunting
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following hunting detection identifies rundll32.exe with `control_rundll`
  within the command-line, loading a .cpl or another file type. Developed in relation
  to CVE-2021-40444. Rundll32.exe can also be used to execute Control Panel Item files
  (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions Control_RunDLL and Control_RunDLLAsUser.
  Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. \ This is written
  to be a bit more broad by not including .cpl. \ During triage, review parallel processes
  to identify any further suspicious behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=rundll32.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=RUNDLL32.EXE) Processes.process=*Control_RunDLL*  by
  Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `rundll32_control_rundll_hunt_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: This is a hunting detection, meant to provide a understanding
  of how voluminous control_rundll is within the environment.
