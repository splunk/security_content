description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the Windows shutdown
  command via the command line interface. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments.
  This activity is significant because attackers may use the shutdown command to erase
  tracks, cause disruption, or ensure changes take effect after installing backdoors.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to system downtime, denial of service,
  or evasion of security tools, impacting the overall security posture of the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name = shutdown.exe OR Processes.original_file_name = shutdown.exe)
  Processes.process="*shutdown*" AND Processes.process IN("* /s*", "* -s*") AND Processes.process
  IN ("* /t*","* -t*","* /f*","* -f*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_system_shutdown_commandline_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator may execute this commandline to trigger shutdown
  or restart the host machine.
