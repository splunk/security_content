description: The following analytic identifies Windows commandlined to shutdown a windows host machine. 
  This technique was seen in several APT, RAT like dcrat and other commodity malware to shutdown the machine to add more impact, 
  interrupt access, aid destruction of the system like wiping disk or inhibit system recovery.
  This TTP is a good pivot to check why application trigger this commandline which is not so common way to shutdown a machine.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name = shutdown.exe OR Processes.original_file_name = shutdown.exe) Processes.process="*shutdown*" Processes.process="* /s*" Processes.process="* /t*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_system_shutdown_commandline_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Administrator may execute this commandline to trigger shutdown or restart the host machine.
