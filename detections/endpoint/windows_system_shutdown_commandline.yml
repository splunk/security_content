description: This detection rule is designed to identify the execution of the Windows
  shutdown command via command line interface. The shutdown command can be utilized
  by system administrators to properly halt, power off, or reboot a computer. However,
  in a security context, attackers who have gained unauthorized access to a system
  may also use this command in an effort to erase tracks, or to cause disruption and
  denial of service. In some instances, they might execute the shutdown command after
  installing a backdoor, to force the system to restart, ensuring that changes take
  effect or evading detection by security tools. Monitoring for the use of the Windows
  shutdown command, especially in conjunction with other unusual or unauthorized activities,
  can be an important part of identifying malicious behavior within a network. It
  is advised that security professionals analyze the context in which the shutdown
  command is being executed to differentiate between legitimate administrative functions
  and potentially malicious activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator may execute this commandline to trigger shutdown
  or restart the host machine.
