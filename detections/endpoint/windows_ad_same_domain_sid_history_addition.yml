description: The following analytic detects changes to the sIDHistory attribute of
  user or computer objects within the same domain. It leverages Windows Security Event
  Codes 4738 and 4742 to identify when the sIDHistory attribute is modified. This
  activity is significant because the sIDHistory attribute can be abused by adversaries
  to grant unauthorized access by inheriting permissions from another account. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain persistent access or
  escalate privileges within the domain, posing a severe security risk.
search: '`wineventlog_security` (EventCode=4742 OR EventCode=4738) NOT SidHistory
  IN ("%%1793", -) | rex field=SidHistory "(^%{|^)(?P<SidHistoryMatch>.*)(\-|\\\)"
  | rex field=TargetSid "^(?P<TargetSidmatch>.*)(\-|\\\)" | where SidHistoryMatch=TargetSidmatch
  OR SidHistoryMatch=TargetDomainName | rename TargetSid as userSid, TargetDomainName
  as userDomainName | table _time action status host user userSid userDomainName SidHistory
  Logon_ID src_user | `windows_ad_same_domain_sid_history_addition_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  eventcodes `4738` and `4742`. The Advanced Security Audit policy settings `Audit
  User Account Management` and  `Audit Computer Account Management` within `Account
  Management` all need to be enabled. SID resolution is not required..
