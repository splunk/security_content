description: The following analytic looks for changes to the sIDHistory AD attribute of user or computer objects which exist within the same domain. 
 The SID history AD attribute allows users to inherit permissions from a separate AD account without group changes. Initially developed for access
 continuity when migrating user accounts to different domains, this attribute can also be abused by adversaries to stealthily grant access to a backdoor account within the same domain. 
 This analytic was written to pick up on activity via Mimikatz sid::patch. Please note there are additional avenues to abuse SID history such as DCShadow & Golden / Diamond tickets which won't be detected using these event codes.
search: '`wineventlog_security` (EventCode=4742 OR EventCode=4738) NOT SidHistory
  IN ("%%1793", -)
  | rex field=SidHistory "(^%{|^)(?P<SidHistoryMatch>.*)(\-|\\\)"
  | rex field=TargetSid "^(?P<TargetSidmatch>.*)(\-|\\\)"
  | where SidHistoryMatch=TargetSidmatch OR SidHistoryMatch=TargetDomainName
  | rename TargetSid as userSid, TargetDomainName as userDomainName
  | table _time action status host user userSid userDomainName SidHistory Logon_ID src_user 
  | `windows_ad_same_domain_sid_history_addition_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting eventcodes
 `4738` and `4742`. The Advanced Security Audit policy settings 
 `Audit User Account Management` and  `Audit Computer Account Management`
 within `Account Management` all need to be enabled. SID resolution is not required..
