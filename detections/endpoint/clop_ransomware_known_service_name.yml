search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 Service_Name IN ("SecurityCenterIBM",
  "WinCheckDRVs") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by
  EventCode Service_File_Name Service_Name Service_Start_Type Service_Type | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `clop_ransomware_known_service_name_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
