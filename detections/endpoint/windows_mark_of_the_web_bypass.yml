description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process that deletes the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) data stream. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 23 to detect when a file's Zone.Identifier stream is removed. This activity is significant because it is a common technique used by malware, such as Ave Maria RAT, to bypass security restrictions on files downloaded from the internet. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to execute potentially harmful files without triggering security warnings, leading to further compromise of the system.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=23 TargetFilename = "*:Zone.Identifier" | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by user EventCode Image TargetFilename ProcessID dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_mark_of_the_web_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the deleted target file name, process name and process id  from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
