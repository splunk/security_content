description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process that delete mark-of-the-web data stream. 
  This technique has been observed in various instances of malware and adversarial activities aimed at circumventing 
  security restrictions within the Windows Operating System, particularly pertaining to files downloaded from the internet. 
  An example of this scenario is demonstrated by Ave Maria RAT, which attempts to delete this data stream as a means to evade such restrictions.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=23 TargetFilename = "*:Zone.Identifier" 
  | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by user EventCode Image TargetFilename ProcessID dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_mark_of_the_web_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the deleted target file name, 
  process name and process id  from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
