description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry
  to disable security settings of Terminal Services. altering or disabling security
  settings within Terminal Services. Terminal Services, now known as Remote Desktop
  Services (RDS) in more recent Windows versions, allows users to access applications,
  data, and even an entire desktop remotely. DarkGate malware modify this registry
  as part of its malicious installation in a targeted host for its remote desktop
  capabilities.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
