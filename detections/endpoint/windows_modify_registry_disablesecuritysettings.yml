description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that disable security settings for Terminal Services. It leverages the Endpoint
  data model, specifically monitoring changes to the registry path associated with
  Terminal Services security settings. This activity is significant because altering
  these settings can weaken the security posture of Remote Desktop Services, potentially
  allowing unauthorized remote access. If confirmed malicious, such modifications
  could enable attackers to gain persistent remote access to the system, facilitating
  further exploitation and data exfiltration.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path = "*\\Terminal
  Services\\DisableSecuritySettings"  Registry.registry_value_data = 0x00000001 by  Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid

  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_disablesecuritysettings_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
