description: The following analytic assists with identifying a PowerShell process
  spawned as a child or grand child process of commonly abused processes during lateral
  movement techniques including `services.exe`, `wmiprsve.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`
  and `mmc.exe`. Legitimate Windows features such as the Service Control Manager,
  Windows Management Instrumentation, Task Scheduler, Windows Remote Management and
  the DCOM protocol can be abused to start a process on a remote endpoint. Looking
  for PowerShell spawned out of this processes may reveal a lateral movement attack.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse these services during a breach for lateral
  movement and remote code execution.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name=wmiprvse.exe
  OR Processes.parent_process_name=services.exe OR Processes.parent_process_name=svchost.exe
  OR Processes.parent_process_name=wsmprovhost.exe OR Processes.parent_process_name=mmc.exe)
  (Processes.process_name=powershell.exe OR (Processes.process_name=cmd.exe AND Processes.process=*powershell.exe*)
  OR Processes.process_name=pwsh.exe OR (Processes.process_name=cmd.exe AND Processes.process=*pwsh.exe*))
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `possible_lateral_movement_powershell_spawn_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may spawn PowerShell as a child process
  of the the identified processes. Filter as needed.
