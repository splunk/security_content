description: 'The following analytic detects the spawning of a PowerShell process
  as a child or grandchild of commonly abused processes like services.exe, wmiprsve.exe,
  svchost.exe, wsmprovhost.exe, and mmc.exe. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and parent process names, as well
  as command-line executions. This activity is significant as it often indicates lateral
  movement or remote code execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to execute code remotely, escalate privileges,
  or persist within the environment.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may spawn PowerShell as a child process
  of the the identified processes. Filter as needed.
