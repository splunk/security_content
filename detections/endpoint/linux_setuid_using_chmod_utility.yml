description: This analytic looks for suspicious chmod utility execution to enable
  SUID bit. This allows a user to temporarily gain root access, usually in order to
  run a program. For example, only the root account is allowed to change the password
  information contained in the password database; If the SUID bit appears as an s,
  the file's owner also has execute permission to the file; if it appears as an S,
  the file's owner does not have execute permission. The second specialty permission
  is the SGID, or set group id bit. It is similar to the SUID bit, except it can temporarily
  change group membership, usually to execute a program. The SGID bit is set if an
  s or an S appears in the group section of permissions.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
