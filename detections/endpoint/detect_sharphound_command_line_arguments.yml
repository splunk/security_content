description: The following analytic identifies common command-line arguments used
  by SharpHound `-collectionMethod` and `invoke-bloodhound`. Being the script is FOSS,
  function names may be modified, but these changes are dependent upon the operator.
  In most instances the defaults are used. This analytic works to identify the common
  command-line attributes used. It does not cover the entirety of every argument in
  order to avoid false positives.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN ("*-collectionMethod*","*invoke-bloodhound*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_sharphound_command_line_arguments_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as the arguments used are
  specific to SharpHound. Filter as needed or add more command-line arguments as needed.
