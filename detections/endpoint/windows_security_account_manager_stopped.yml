description: The search looks for a Windows Security Account Manager (SAM) was stopped
  via command-line. This is consistent with Ryuk infections across a fleet of endpoints.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the process-system activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint Processes data-model object. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.

known_false_positives: SAM is a critical windows service, stopping it would cause
  major issues on an endpoint this makes false positive rare. AlthoughNo false positives
  have been identified.
