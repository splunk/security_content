status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic is to identify a modification in the Windows registry
  to enable remote desktop assistance on a targeted machine. This technique was seen
  in several adversaries, malware or red teamer like azorult to remotely access the
  compromised or targeted host by enabling this protocol in registry. Even this protocol
  might be allowed in some production environment, This Anomaly behavior is a good
  pivot to check who and why the user want to enable this feature through registry
  which is un-common. And as per stated in microsoft documentation the default value
  of this registry is false that makes this a good indicator of suspicious behavior.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
