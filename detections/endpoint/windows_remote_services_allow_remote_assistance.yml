description: The following analytic detects modifications in the Windows registry
  to enable remote desktop assistance on a targeted machine. It leverages data from
  the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to the "Control\\Terminal
  Server\\fAllowToGetHelp" registry path. This activity is significant because enabling
  remote assistance via registry is uncommon and often associated with adversaries
  or malware like Azorult. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to
  remotely access and control the compromised host, leading to potential data exfiltration
  or further system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 12 
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Control\\Terminal
  Server\\fAllowToGetHelp*" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001" by Registry.registry_key_name
  Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action
  Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_services_allow_remote_assistance_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
