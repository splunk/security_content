description: The following analytic detects when a process running with low or medium
  integrity from a user account spawns an elevated process with high or system integrity
  in suspicious locations. This behavior is identified using process execution data
  from Windows process monitoring or Sysmon EventID 1. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate a threat actor successfully elevating privileges, which is a
  common tactic in advanced attacks. If confirmed malicious, this could allow the
  attacker to execute code with higher privileges, potentially leading to full system
  compromise and persistent access.

how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest process execution data sources such
  as Windows process monitoring and/or Sysmon EID 1.
known_false_positives: False positives may be generated by administrators installing
  benign applications using run-as/elevation.
