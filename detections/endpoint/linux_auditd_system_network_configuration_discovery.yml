description: The following analytic detects suspicious system network configuration discovery activities, which may indicate an adversary's attempt to gather information about the network environment. Such actions typically involve commands or tools used to identify network interfaces, routing tables, and active connections. Detecting these activities is crucial, as they often precede more targeted attacks like lateral movement or data exfiltration. By identifying unusual or unauthorized network discovery efforts, this analytic helps security teams to swiftly detect and respond to potential reconnaissance operations, mitigating the risk of further compromise.

- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL comm IN ("arp", "ifconfig", "ip", "netstat", "firewall-cmd", "ufw", "iptables", "ss", "route") | bucket _time span=15m | rename host as dest | stats dc(comm) as unique_commands, values(comm) as comm, values(exe) as exe, values(SYSCALL) as SYSCALL, values(UID) as UID, values(ppid) as ppid, values(pid) as pid, count, min(_time) as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime by success dest | where unique_commands >= 4 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_auditd_system_network_configuration_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
