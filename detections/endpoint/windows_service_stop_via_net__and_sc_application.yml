datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic identifies suspicious attempts to stop services on a system using either `net.exe` or `sc.exe`. 
  This technique is used by adversaries to terminate security services or other related services to continue their objective 
  and evade detections. This technique is also commonly used by ransomware threat actors to successfully encrypt databases 
  or files being processed or used by Windows OS Services.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where `process_net` OR  Processes.process_name = "sc.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name= "sc.exe" AND Processes.process="*stop*" 
  by  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_service_stop_via_net__and_sc_application_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Windows OS or software may stop and restart services due to some critical update.
