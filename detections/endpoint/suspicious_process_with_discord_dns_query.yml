name: Suspicious Process With Discord DNS Query

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a process making a DNS query to Discord,
  excluding legitimate Discord application paths. It leverages Sysmon logs with Event
  ID 22 to detect DNS queries containing "discord" in the QueryName field. This activity
  is significant because Discord can be abused by adversaries to host and download
  malicious files, as seen in the WhisperGate campaign. If confirmed malicious, this
  could indicate malware attempting to download additional payloads from Discord,
  potentially leading to further code execution and compromise of the affected system.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*discord*") Image != "*\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\*"
  AND Image != "*\\Program Files*" AND Image != "discord.exe" | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName QueryStatus process_name
  QueryResults Computer | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_process_with_discord_dns_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: his detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 22, DNS Query.
known_false_positives: Noise and false positive can be seen if the following instant
  messaging is allowed to use within corporate network. In this case, a filter is
  needed.
