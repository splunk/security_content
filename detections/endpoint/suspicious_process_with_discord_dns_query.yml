description: This analytic identifies a process making a DNS query to Discord, a well
  known instant messaging and digital distribution platform. Discord can be abused
  by adversaries, as seen in the WhisperGate campaign, to host and download malicious.
  external files. A process resolving a Discord DNS name could be an indicator of
  malware trying to download files from Discord for further execution.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*discord*") Image != "*\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\*"
  AND Image != "*\\Program Files*" AND Image != "discord.exe" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName QueryStatus
  process_name QueryResults Computer | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_process_with_discord_dns_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: his detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 22, DNS Query.
known_false_positives: Noise and false positive can be seen if the following instant
  messaging is allowed to use within corporate network. In this case, a filter is
  needed.
