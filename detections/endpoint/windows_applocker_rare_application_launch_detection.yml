description: The following analytic detects the launch of rarely used applications
  within the environment, which may indicate the use of potentially malicious software
  or tools by attackers. It leverages Windows AppLocker event logs, aggregating application
  launch counts over time and flagging those that significantly deviate from the norm.
  This behavior is significant as it helps identify unusual application activity that
  could signal a security threat. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
  attackers to execute unauthorized code, potentially leading to further compromise
  of the system.
search: '`applocker` | spath input=UserData_Xml | rename RuleAndFileData.* as *, Computer
  as dest, TargetUser AS user | stats dc(_time) as days, count by FullFilePath dest
  user | eventstats avg(count) as avg, stdev(count) as stdev | eval upperBound=(avg+stdev*3),
  lowerBound=(avg-stdev*3) | where count > upperBound OR count < lowerBound | `windows_applocker_rare_application_launch_detection_filter`'
how_to_implement: The analytic is designed to be run against Windows AppLocker event
  logs collected from endpoints with AppLocker enabled. If using Microsoft Defender
  for Endpoint (MDE), modify the analytic to use EventTypes/ActionTypes that match
  the block events for AppLocker. The analytic requires the AppLocker event logs to
  be ingested into Splunk. Note that, an additional method to reduce any false positives
  would be to add the specific EventCodes - 8003 or 8004 and filter from there.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate users are launching
  applications that are not permitted by AppLocker. It is recommended to investigate
  the context of the application launch to determine if it is malicious or not. Modify
  the threshold as needed to reduce false positives.
