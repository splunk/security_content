description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of protocol handlers executed
  via the command line. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process and command-line telemetry. This activity is significant
  because protocol handlers can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands or launch
  applications, potentially leading to unauthorized actions. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could use this technique to gain code execution, escalate privileges,
  or maintain persistence within the environment, posing a significant security risk.'
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(Processes.process) as process values(Processes.parent_process)
  as parent_process from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes  by Processes.dest Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.process | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be found. https and http is a URL Protocol
  handler that will trigger this analytic. Tune based on process or command-line.
