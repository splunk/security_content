description: The following analytic detects the presence of any version of the 3CXDesktopApp,
  also known as the 3CX Desktop App, on Mac or Windows systems. It leverages the Endpoint
  data model's Processes node to identify instances of the application running, although
  it does not provide file version information. This activity is significant because
  3CX has identified vulnerabilities in versions 18.12.407 and 18.12.416, which could
  be exploited by attackers. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  access, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the affected systems.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=3CXDesktopApp.exe
  OR Processes.process_name="3CX Desktop App" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `hunting_3cxdesktopapp_software_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There may be false positives generated due to the reliance
  on version numbers for identification purposes. Despite this limitation, the primary
  goal of this approach is to aid in the detection of the software within the environment.
