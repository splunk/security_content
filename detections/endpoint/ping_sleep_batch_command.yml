description: This analytic will identify the possible execution of ping sleep batch
  commands. This technique was seen in several malware samples and is used to trigger
  sleep times without explicitly calling sleep functions or commandlets. The goal
  is to delay the execution of malicious code and bypass detection or sandbox analysis.
  This  detection can be a good indicator of a process delaying its execution for
  malicious purposes.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_ping` (Processes.parent_process
  = "*ping*" Processes.parent_process = *-n* Processes.parent_process="* Nul*"Processes.parent_process="*&gt;*")
  OR (Processes.process = "*ping*" Processes.process = *-n* Processes.process="* Nul*"Processes.process="*&gt;*")
  by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid
  Processes.user Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ping_sleep_batch_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator may execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
