description: The following analytic identifies the execution of ping sleep batch commands.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process and parent process command-line details. This activity is significant as
  it indicates an attempt to delay malicious code execution, potentially evading detection
  or sandbox analysis. If confirmed malicious, this technique allows attackers to
  bypass security measures, making it harder to detect and analyze their activities,
  thereby increasing the risk of prolonged unauthorized access and potential data
  exfiltration.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_ping` (Processes.parent_process
  = "*ping*" Processes.parent_process = *-n* Processes.parent_process="* Nul*"Processes.parent_process="*&gt;*")
  OR (Processes.process = "*ping*" Processes.process = *-n* Processes.process="* Nul*"Processes.process="*&gt;*")

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator may execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
