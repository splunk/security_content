description: This search looks for newly created accounts that have been elevated
  to local administrators.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4720 OR (EventCode=4732 Group_Name=Administrators)
  | transaction member_id connected=false maxspan=180m | rename member_id as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by user dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_new_local_admin_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Windows event logs using the Splunk Windows
  TA and collecting event code 4720 and 4732
known_false_positives: The activity may be legitimate. For this reason, it's best
  to verify the account with an administrator and ask whether there was a valid service
  request for the account creation. If your local administrator group name is not
  "Administrators", this search may generate an excessive number of false positives
