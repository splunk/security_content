name: Malicious Powershell Executed As A Service

description: The following analytic identifies the execution of malicious PowerShell
  commands or payloads via the Windows SC.exe utility. It detects this activity by
  analyzing Windows System logs (EventCode 7045) and filtering for specific PowerShell-related
  patterns in the ImagePath field. This behavior is significant because it indicates
  potential abuse of the Windows Service Control Manager to run unauthorized or harmful
  scripts, which could lead to system compromise. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain
  persistence within the environment.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log System 7045
search: ' `wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 | eval l_ImagePath=lower(ImagePath)
  | regex l_ImagePath="powershell[.\s]|powershell_ise[.\s]|pwsh[.\s]|psexec[.\s]"
  | regex l_ImagePath="-nop[rofile\s]+|-w[indowstyle]*\s+hid[den]*|-noe[xit\s]+|-enc[odedcommand\s]+"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ImagePath
  ServiceName StartType ServiceType AccountName UserID dest | rename UserID as user|
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `malicious_powershell_executed_as_a_service_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows System logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type,
  and Service Type from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Creating a hidden powershell service is rare and could key
  off of those instances.
