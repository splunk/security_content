description: The following analytic identifies the use of taskkill.exe to forcibly
  terminate processes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on command-line executions that include specific taskkill parameters.
  This activity is significant because it can indicate attempts to disable security
  tools or disrupt legitimate applications, a common tactic in malware operations.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to evade detection,
  disrupt system stability, and potentially gain further control over the compromised
  system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Network administrator can use this application to kill process
  during audit or investigation.
