description: 'The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique invalid users using the NTLM protocol. This behavior could represent
  an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment
  using NTLM to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. 
  Active Directory environments can be very different depending on the organization. Users should test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed.
  As attackers progress
  in a breach, mistakes will be made. In certain scenarios, adversaries may execute
  a password spraying attack using an invalid list of users. Event 4776 is generated
  on the computer that is authoritative for the provided credentials. For domain accounts,
  the domain controller is authoritative. For local accounts, the local computer is
  authoritative. Error code 0xC0000064 stands for `The username you typed does not
  exist` (the attempted user is a legitimate domain user).\

  This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.
  This detection will only trigger on domain controllers, not on member servers or
  workstations.\

  The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by
  providing fields like source workstation name and attempted user accounts.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Credential
  Validation' within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple invalid domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
  If this detection triggers on a host other than a Domain Controller, the behavior
  could represent a password spraying attack against the host's local accounts.
