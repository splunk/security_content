description: 'The following analytic detects a single source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique invalid users using the NTLM protocol. It leverages EventCode 4776
  from Domain Controller logs, focusing on error code 0xC0000064, which indicates
  non-existent usernames. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password
  Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, and potential compromise of sensitive information within the Active
  Directory environment.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Credential
  Validation' within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple invalid domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
  If this detection triggers on a host other than a Domain Controller, the behavior
  could represent a password spraying attack against the host's local accounts.
