description: The following analytic identifies a `.dll` being written by `spoolsv.exe`.
  This was identified during our testing of CVE-2021-34527 previously(CVE-2021-1675)
  or PrintNightmare. Typically, this is not normal behavior for `spoolsv.exe` to write
  a `.dll`. Current POC code used will write the suspicious DLL to disk within a path
  of `\spool\drivers\x64\`. During triage, isolate the endpoint and review for source
  of exploitation. Capture any additional file modification events.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=11 process_name=spoolsv.exe file_path="*\\spool\\drivers\\x64\\*"
  file_name=*.dll | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by
  dest, UserID, process_name, file_path, file_name, TargetFilename, process_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `spoolsv_writing_a_dll___sysmon_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives. Filter as needed.
