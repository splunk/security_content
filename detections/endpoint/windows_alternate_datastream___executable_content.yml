description: The following analytic detects the writing of data with an IMPHASH value to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) in the NTFS file system. It leverages Sysmon Event ID 15 and regex to identify files with a Portable Executable (PE) structure. This activity is significant as it may indicate a threat actor staging malicious code in hidden areas for persistence or future execution. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute hidden code, maintain persistence, or escalate privileges within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 15
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=15 IMPHASH!=00000000000000000000000000000000 | regex TargetFilename="(?<!\/)\b\w+(\.\w+)?:\w+(\.\w+)?$" | eval file_name = replace(TargetFilename,"(.*\\\)",""), process = Image , file_path = TargetFilename, file_hash = coalesce(SHA256,SHA1,MD5,Hash) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user) as user by dest, process, process_guid, file_name, file_path, file_hash, IMPHASH | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_alternate_datastream___executable_content_filter`'
how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest Sysmon data, specifically Event ID 15, and import hashing/imphash must be enabled within Sysmon.
