description: This analytic identifies the use of the New-CIMSession cmdlet being created along with the Invoke-CIMMethod cmdlet being used within PowerShell. This particular behavior is similar to the usage of the Invoke-WMIMethod cmdlet, which is known for executing WMI commands on targets using NTLMv2 pass-the-hash authentication. The New-CIMSession cmdlet allows users to create a new CIM session object for a specified computer system, which can then be used to execute CIM operations remotely. Similarly, the Invoke-CIMMethod cmdlet is used to invoke a specified method on one or more CIM objects. Therefore, the combination of New-CIMSession and Invoke-CIMMethod cmdlets in PowerShell can potentially indicate malicious behavior, and this analytic can help detect such activity.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on third-party applications or administrators using CIM. It is recommended to apply appropriate filters as needed to minimize the number of false positives.
