description: The following analytic detects the creation of a New-CIMSession cmdlet
  followed by the use of the Invoke-CIMMethod cmdlet within PowerShell. It leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging to identify these specific cmdlets in the ScriptBlockText
  field. This activity is significant because it mirrors the behavior of the Invoke-WMIMethod
  cmdlet, often used for remote code execution via NTLMv2 pass-the-hash authentication.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute commands remotely,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over targeted systems.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN ("*invoke-CIMMethod*", "*New-CimSession*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode
  ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_invoke_cimmethod_cimsession_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on third-party applications
  or administrators using CIM. It is recommended to apply appropriate filters as needed
  to minimize the number of false positives.
