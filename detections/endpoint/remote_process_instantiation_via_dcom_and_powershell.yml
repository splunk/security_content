- Endpoint
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with arguments
  utilized to start a process on a remote endpoint by abusing the DCOM protocol. Specifically,
  this search looks for the abuse of ShellExecute and ExecuteShellCommand. Red Teams
  and adversaries alike may abuse DCOM and `powershell.exe` for lateral movement and
  remote code execution.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell` (Processes.process="*Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand*"
  OR Processes.process="*Document.Application.ShellExecute*") by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_process_instantiation_via_dcom_and_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage DCOM to start a process on remote
  systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
