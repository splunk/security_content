description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  arguments used to start a process on a remote endpoint by abusing the DCOM protocol,
  specifically targeting ShellExecute and ExecuteShellCommand. It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent
  processes, and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it indicates
  potential lateral movement and remote code execution attempts by adversaries. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely,
  escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network, posing a severe security
  risk.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell` (Processes.process="*Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand*"
  OR Processes.process="*Document.Application.ShellExecute*") by Processes.dest Processes.user

  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_process_instantiation_via_dcom_and_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage DCOM to start a process on remote
  systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
