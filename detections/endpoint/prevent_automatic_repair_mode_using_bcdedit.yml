description: This search is to detect a suspicious bcdedit.exe execution to ignore
  all failures. This technique was used by ransomware to prevent the compromise machine
  automatically boot in repair mode.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "bcdedit.exe"
  Processes.process = "*bootstatuspolicy*"  Processes.process = "*ignoreallfailures*"
  by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `prevent_automatic_repair_mode_using_bcdedit_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may modify the boot configuration ignore failure
  during testing and debugging.
