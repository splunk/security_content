description: The following analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to identify the Get-ADComputer commandlet used with specific parameters to discover
  Windows endpoints with Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may leverage use this technique for situational awareness and Active Directory
  Discovery.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: ' `powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText = "*Get-ADComputer*" AND ScriptBlockText =
  "*TrustedForDelegation*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_get_adcomputer_unconstrained_delegation_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following  analytic requires PowerShell operational logs to
  be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or add
  index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may leverage PowerView for system
  management or troubleshooting.
