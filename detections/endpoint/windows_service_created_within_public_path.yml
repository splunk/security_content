description: The following analytc uses Windows Event Id 7045, `New Service Was Installed`,
  to identify the creation of a Windows Service where the service binary path is located
  in public paths. This behavior could represent the installation of a malicious service.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may create malicious Services for lateral movement
  or remote code execution
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045  Service_File_Name = "*\.exe" NOT (Service_File_Name
  IN ("C:\\Windows\\*", "C:\\Program File*", "C:\\Programdata\\*", "%systemroot%\\*"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName EventCode
  Service_File_Name Service_Name Service_Start_Type Service_Type | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_created_within_public_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may install services with uncommon
  services paths.
