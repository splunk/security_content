description: The following analytc uses Windows Event Id 7045, `New Service Was Installed`,
  to identify the creation of a Windows Service where the service binary path is located
  in public paths. This behavior could represent the installation of a malicious service.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may create malicious Services for lateral movement
  or remote code execution
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ImagePath = "*.exe" NOT (ImagePath
  IN ("*:\\Windows\\*", "*:\\Program File*", "*:\\Programdata\\*", "*%systemroot%\\*"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ImagePath
  ServiceName ServiceType StartType Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_created_within_public_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may install services with uncommon
  services paths.
