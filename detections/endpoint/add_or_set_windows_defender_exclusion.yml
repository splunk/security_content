description: The following analytic detects the use of commands to add or set exclusions
  in Windows Defender. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on command-line executions involving "Add-MpPreference" or "Set-MpPreference"
  with exclusion parameters. This activity is significant because adversaries often
  use it to bypass Windows Defender, allowing malicious code to execute undetected.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could enable attackers to evade antivirus
  detection, maintain persistence, and execute further malicious activities without
  interference from Windows Defender.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process = "*Add-MpPreference
  *" OR Processes.process = "*Set-MpPreference *") AND Processes.process="*-exclusion*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `add_or_set_windows_defender_exclusion_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Admin or user may choose to use this windows features. Filter
  as needed.
