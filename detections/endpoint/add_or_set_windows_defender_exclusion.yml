name: Add or Set Windows Defender Exclusion

description: The following analytic detects the use of commands to add or set exclusions in Windows Defender. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving "Add-MpPreference" or "Set-MpPreference" with exclusion parameters. This activity is significant because adversaries often use it to bypass Windows Defender, allowing malicious code to execute undetected. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could enable attackers to evade antivirus detection, maintain persistence, and execute further malicious activities without interference from Windows Defender.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
