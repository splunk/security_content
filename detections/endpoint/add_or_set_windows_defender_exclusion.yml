description: This analytic will identify a suspicious process command-line related
  to Windows Defender exclusion feature. This command is abused by adversaries, malware
  authors and red teams to bypass Windows Defender Antivirus products by excluding
  folder path, file path, process and extensions. From its real time or schedule scan
  to execute their malicious code. This is a good indicator for defense evasion and
  to look further for events after this behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process = "*Add-MpPreference
  *" OR Processes.process = "*Set-MpPreference *") AND Processes.process="*-exclusion*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `add_or_set_windows_defender_exclusion_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Admin or user may choose to use this windows features. Filter
  as needed.
