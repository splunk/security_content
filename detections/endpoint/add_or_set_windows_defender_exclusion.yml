description: This analytic will detect a suspicious process commandline related to
  windows defender exclusion feature. This command is abused by adversaries, malware
  author and red teams to bypassed Windows Defender Anti-Virus product by excluding  folder
  path, file path, process, extensions and etc. from its real time or schedule scan
  to execute their malicious code. This is a good indicator for defense evasion and
  to look further for events after this behavior.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process = "*Add-MpPreference
  *" OR Processes.process = "*Set-MpPreference *") AND Processes.process="*-exclusion*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `add_or_set_windows_defender_exclusion_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: admin or user may choose to use this windows features.
