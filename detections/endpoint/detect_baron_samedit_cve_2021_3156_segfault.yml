type: TTP
description: |-
  The following analytic detects the occurrence of a heap-based buffer overflow in sudoedit.The detection is made by using a Splunk query to identify Linux hosts where the terms "sudoedit" and "segfault" appear in the logs. The detection is important because the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in sudoedit can be exploited by attackers to gain elevated root privileges on a vulnerable system, which might lead to the compromise of sensitive data, unauthorized access, and other malicious activities. False positives might occur. Therefore, you must review the logs and investigate further before taking any action.
data_source: []
search: '`linux_hosts` TERM(sudoedit) TERM(segfault) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by host | where count > 5 | `detect_baron_samedit_cve_2021_3156_segfault_filter`'
how_to_implement: Splunk Universal Forwarder running on Linux systems (tested on Centos
  and Ubuntu), where segfaults are being logged.  This also captures instances where
  the exploit has been compiled into a binary. The detection looks for greater than
  5 instances of sudoedit combined with segfault over your search time period on a
  single host
known_false_positives: If sudoedit is throwing segfaults for other reasons this will
  pick those up too.
