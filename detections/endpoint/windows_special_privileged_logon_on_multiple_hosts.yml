description: The following analytic leverages Event ID 4672 to identify a source user
  authenticating with special privileges across a large number remote endpoints. Specifically,
  the logic will trigger when a source user obtains special privileges across 30 or
  more target computers within a 5 minute timespan. Special privileges are assigned
  to a new logon session when sensitive privileges like SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege
  are assigned. This behavior could represent an adversary who is moving laterally
  and executing remote code across the network. It can also be triggered by other
  behavior like an adversary enumerating network shares. As environments differ across
  organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this detection
  as needed.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4672 AND NOT(Caller_User_Name IN ("DWM-1","DWM-2","DWM-3","LOCAL SERVICE","NETWORK SERVICE","SYSTEM","*$")) | bucket span=5m _time | stats dc(Computer)
  AS unique_targets values(Computer) as host_targets values(PrivilegeList) as privileges
  by _time, Caller_User_Name | rename Caller_User_Name as user| where unique_targets > 30 | `windows_special_privileged_logon_on_multiple_hosts_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  special logon events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Special
  Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` need to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Vulnerability scanners or system administration tools may also
  trigger this detection. Filter as needed.
