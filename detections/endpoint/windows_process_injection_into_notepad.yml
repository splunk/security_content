name: Windows Process Injection into Notepad
id: b8340d0f-ba48-4391-bea7-9e793c5aae36
version: 3

author: Michael Haag, Splunk
type: Anomaly
status: production
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
description: The following analytic detects process injection into Notepad.exe using
  Sysmon EventCode 10. It identifies suspicious GrantedAccess requests (0x40 and 0x1fffff)
  to Notepad.exe, excluding common system paths like System32, Syswow64, and Program
  Files. This behavior is often associated with the SliverC2 framework by BishopFox.
  Monitoring this activity is crucial as it may indicate an initial payload attempting
  to execute malicious code within Notepad.exe. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to privilege escalation
  or persistent access within the environment.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage IN (*\\notepad.exe) NOT (SourceImage IN
  ("*\\system32\\*","*\\syswow64\\*","*\\Program Files\\*")) GrantedAccess IN ("0x40","0x1fffff")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest SourceImage
  TargetImage GrantedAccess CallTrace | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_process_injection_into_notepad_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on SourceImage paths.
  If removing the paths is important, realize svchost and many native binaries inject
  into notepad consistently. Restrict or tune as needed.
