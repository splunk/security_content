type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search looks for arguments to certutil.exe indicating the manipulation
  or extraction of Certificate. This certificate can then be used to sign new authentication
  tokens specially inside Federated environments such as Windows ADFS.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=certutil.exe
  Processes.process = "*-exportPFX*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `certutil_exe_certificate_extraction_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Unless there are specific use cases, manipulating or exporting
  certificates using certutil is uncommon. Extraction of certificate has been observed
  during attacks such as Golden SAML and other campaigns targeting Federated services.
