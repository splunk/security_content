description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` using
  the `Invoke-WmiMethod` cmdlet to start a process on a remote endpoint via WMI. It
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  executions and process telemetry. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
  lateral movement or remote code execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on remote systems,
  leading to further compromise and persistence within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell` (Processes.process="*Invoke-WmiMethod*"
  AND Processes.process="*-CN*" AND Processes.process="*-Class Win32_Process*" AND  Processes.process="*-Name
  create*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_process_instantiation_via_wmi_and_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WWMI and powershell.exe to start
  a process on remote systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set
  of hosts or users.
