name: Linux High Frequency Of File Deletion In Etc Folder

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects a high frequency of file deletions in
  the /etc/ folder on Linux systems. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem data model
  to identify instances where 200 or more files are deleted within an hour, grouped
  by process name and process ID. This behavior is significant as it may indicate
  the presence of wiper malware, such as AcidRain, which aims to delete critical system
  files. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to severe system instability,
  data loss, and potential disruption of services.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Filesystem.file_name) as
  deletedFileNames values(Filesystem.file_path) as deletedFilePath dc(Filesystem.file_path)
  as numOfDelFilePath count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where Filesystem.action=deleted Filesystem.file_path = "/etc/*" by _time span=1h  Filesystem.dest
  Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.action | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`  |
  where  numOfDelFilePath >= 200 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_high_frequency_of_file_deletion_in_etc_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: linux package installer/uninstaller may cause this event. Please
  update you filter macro to remove false positives.
