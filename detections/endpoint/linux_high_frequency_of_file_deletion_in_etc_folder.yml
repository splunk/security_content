name: Linux High Frequency Of File Deletion In Etc Folder

type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to detect a high frequency of file deletion relative
  to process name and process id /etc/ folder. These events was seen in acidrain wiper
  malware where it tries to delete all files in a non-standard directory in linux
  directory. This detection already contains some filter that might cause false positive
  during our testing. But we recommend to add more filter if needed.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Filesystem.file_name) as
  deletedFileNames values(Filesystem.file_path) as deletedFilePath dc(Filesystem.file_path)
  as numOfDelFilePath count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where Filesystem.action=deleted Filesystem.file_path = "/etc/*" by _time span=1h  Filesystem.dest
  Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.action | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`  | where  numOfDelFilePath >= 200 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_high_frequency_of_file_deletion_in_etc_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: linux package installer/uninstaller may cause this event. Please
  update you filter macro to remove false positives.
