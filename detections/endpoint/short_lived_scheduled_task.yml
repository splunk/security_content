description: 'The following analytic detects the creation and deletion of scheduled
  tasks within a short time frame (less than 30 seconds) using Windows Security EventCodes
  4698 and 4699. This behavior is identified by analyzing Windows Security Event Logs
  and leveraging the Windows TA for parsing. Such activity is significant as it may
  indicate lateral movement or remote code execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or execution
  of malicious payloads, necessitating prompt investigation and response by security
  analysts.'
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4698
- Windows Event Log Security 4699
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698 OR EventCode=4699 | xmlkv Message
  | transaction Task_Name  startswith=(EventCode=4698) endswith=(EventCode=4699) |
  eval short_lived=case((duration<30),"TRUE") | search  short_lived = TRUE | rename
  ComputerName as dest| table _time, dest, Account_Name, Command, Task_Name, short_lived
  | `short_lived_scheduled_task_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: Although uncommon, legitimate applications may create and delete
  a Scheduled Task within 30 seconds. Filter as needed.
