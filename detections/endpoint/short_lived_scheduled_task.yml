description: The following analytic leverages Windows Security EventCode 4698, `A
  scheduled task was created` and Windows Security EventCode 4699, `A scheduled task
  was deleted` to identify scheduled tasks created and deleted in less than 30 seconds.
  This behavior may represent a lateral movement attack abusing the Task Scheduler
  to obtain code execution. Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse the Task Scheduler
  for lateral movement and remote code execution.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698 OR EventCode=4699 | xmlkv Message
  | transaction Task_Name  startswith=(EventCode=4698) endswith=(EventCode=4699) |
  eval short_lived=case((duration<30),"TRUE") | search  short_lived = TRUE | table
  _time, ComputerName, Account_Name, Command, Task_Name, short_lived | `short_lived_scheduled_task_filter` '
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: Although uncommon, legitimate applications may create and delete
  a Scheduled Task within 30 seconds. Filter as needed.
