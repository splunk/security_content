description: 'The following analytic utilizes Windows Security EventCode 4698, "A
  scheduled task was created," and EventCode 4699, "A scheduled task was deleted,"
  to identify scheduled tasks that are created and deleted within a short time frame
  of less than 30 seconds. This behavior is indicative of a potential lateral movement
  attack where the Task Scheduler is abused to achieve code execution. Both red teams
  and adversaries may exploit the Task Scheduler for lateral movement and remote code
  execution.

  To implement this analytic, ensure that you are ingesting Windows Security Event
  Logs with EventCode 4698 enabled. Additionally, the Windows TA (Technology Add-on)
  is required to parse and extract the necessary information from the logs.

  It''s important to note that while uncommon, legitimate applications may create
  and delete scheduled tasks within a short duration. Analysts should filter the results
  based on the specific context and environment to reduce false positives.

  Identifying short-lived scheduled tasks is valuable for a SOC as it can indicate
  malicious activities attempting to move laterally or execute unauthorized code on
  Windows systems. By detecting and investigating these events, security analysts
  can respond promptly to prevent further compromise and mitigate potential risks.
  The impact of a true positive could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration
  or the execution of malicious payloads.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: Although uncommon, legitimate applications may create and delete
  a Scheduled Task within 30 seconds. Filter as needed.
