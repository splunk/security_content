description: The following analytic detects the modification of the Windows Registry
  key "DisableAntiSpyware" being set to disable. This detection leverages data from
  the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically looking for the registry value name
  "DisableAntiSpyware" with a value of "0x00000001". This activity is significant
  as it is commonly associated with Ryuk ransomware infections, indicating potential
  malicious intent to disable Windows Defender. If confirmed malicious, this action
  could allow attackers to disable critical security defenses, facilitating further
  malicious activities such as data encryption, exfiltration, or additional system
  compromise.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_value_name="DisableAntiSpyware"
  AND Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001" by Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_value_data | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `windows_disableantispyware_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
