description: DynamicWrapperX is an ActiveX component that can be used in a script
  to call Windows API functions, but it requires the dynwrapx.dll to be installed
  and registered. With that, registering or loading dynwrapx.dll to a host is highly
  suspicious. In most instances when it is used maliciously, the best way to triage
  is to review parallel processes and pivot on the process_guid. Review the registry
  for any suspicious modifications meant to load dynwrapx.dll. Identify any suspicious
  module loads of dynwrapx.dll. This detection will return and identify the processes
  that invoke vbs/wscript/cscript.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 (ImageLoaded = "*\\dynwrapx.dll" OR OriginalFileName
  = "dynwrapx.dll" OR  Product = "DynamicWrapperX") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded OriginalFileName Product process_name
  Computer EventCode Signed ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `loading_of_dynwrapx_module_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on processes that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem`
  node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the
  latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however it is possible to
  filter by Processes.process_name and specific processes (ex. wscript.exe). Filter
  as needed. This may need modification based on EDR telemetry and how it brings in
  registry data. For example, removal of (Default).
