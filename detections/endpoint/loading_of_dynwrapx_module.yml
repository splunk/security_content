description: The following analytic detects the loading of the dynwrapx.dll module,
  which is associated with the DynamicWrapperX ActiveX component. This detection leverages
  Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify processes that load or register dynwrapx.dll. This
  activity is significant because DynamicWrapperX can be used to call Windows API
  functions in scripts, making it a potential tool for malicious actions. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges,
  or maintain persistence on the host. Immediate investigation of parallel processes
  and registry modifications is recommended.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 (ImageLoaded = "*\\dynwrapx.dll" OR OriginalFileName
  = "dynwrapx.dll" OR  Product = "DynamicWrapperX") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded OriginalFileName Product process_name
  dest EventCode Signed ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `loading_of_dynwrapx_module_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on processes that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem`
  node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the
  latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however it is possible to
  filter by Processes.process_name and specific processes (ex. wscript.exe). Filter
  as needed. This may need modification based on EDR telemetry and how it brings in
  registry data. For example, removal of (Default).
