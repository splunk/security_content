description: The following analytic identifies the use of the 'kmod' process to list
  kernel modules on a Linux system. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions.
  While listing kernel modules is not inherently malicious, it can be a precursor
  to loading unauthorized modules using 'insmod'. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow an attacker to load kernel modules, potentially leading to privilege
  escalation, persistence, or other malicious actions within the system.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=kmod
  Processes.process IN ("*lsmod*", "*list*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_kernel_module_enumeration_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.
