description: 'The following analytic identifies a source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with multiple invalid users using the NTLM protocol. It leverages EventCode 4776
  and calculates the standard deviation for each host, using the 3-sigma rule to detect
  anomalies. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying attack,
  where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation,
  posing a significant threat to the Active Directory environment. This detection
  is focused on domain controllers.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Credential
  Validation' within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple invalid domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
  If this detection triggers on a host other than a Domain Controller, the behavior
  could represent a password spraying attack against the host's local accounts.
