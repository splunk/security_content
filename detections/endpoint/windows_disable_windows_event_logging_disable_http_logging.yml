description: The following analytic detects the use of AppCmd.exe to disable HTTP
  logging on IIS servers. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process execution events where AppCmd.exe is used with specific
  parameters to alter logging settings. This activity is significant because disabling
  HTTP logging can help adversaries hide their tracks and avoid detection by removing
  evidence of their actions. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to
  operate undetected, making it difficult to trace their activities and respond to
  the intrusion effectively.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where NOT (Processes.parent_process_name  IN
  ("msiexec.exe", "iissetup.exe")) Processes.process_name=appcmd.exe Processes.process
  IN ("*set config*", "*httplogging*","*dontlog:true*") by Processes.dest Processes.user

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_disable_windows_event_logging_disable_http_logging_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present only if scripts or Administrators
  are disabling logging. Filter as needed by parent process or other.
