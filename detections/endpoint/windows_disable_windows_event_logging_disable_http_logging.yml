description: The following analytic identifies AppCmd.exe being utilized to disable
  HTTP logging on IIS. Adversaries may perform this action to disable logging and
  delete the logs so remove any trace or events on disk.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where NOT (Processes.parent_process_name  IN
  ("msiexec.exe", "iissetup.exe")) Processes.process_name=appcmd.exe Processes.process
  IN ("*set config*", "*httplogging*","*dontlog:true*") by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_disable_windows_event_logging_disable_http_logging_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present only if scripts or Administrators
  are disabling logging. Filter as needed by parent process or other.
