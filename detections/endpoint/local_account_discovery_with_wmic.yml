description: The following analytic detects the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
  arguments used to query local user accounts, specifically the `useraccount` argument.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant
  as it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to enumerate local
  users, which is a common step in situational awareness and Active Directory discovery.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to further targeted attacks, privilege
  escalation, or lateral movement within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` (Processes.process=*useraccount*)
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
