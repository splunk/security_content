description: The following analytic leverages events 4625 and 4624 to identify an endpoint using the builtin local Administrator account to authenticate to a large numbers of endpoints. Specifically, 
  the logic will trigger when an endpoints attempts to authenticate to more than 30 target computers within a 5 minute timespan. This behavior could
  represent an adversary who has obtained access to local credentials and is trying to validate if these credentials work on other hosts to escalate their privileges.
   As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this detection as needed.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=3 TargetUserName=Administrator
  | bucket span=5m _time
  | stats dc(Computer) AS unique_targets values(Computer) as host_targets by _time, IpAddress, TargetUserName, EventCode
  | where unique_targets > 30
  | `windows_local_administrator_credential_stuffing_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Vulnerability scanners or system administration tools may also trigger this detection. Filter as needed.
