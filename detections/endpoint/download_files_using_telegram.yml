description: The following analytic detects suspicious file downloads by the Telegram
  application on a Windows system. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 15 to identify instances
  where Telegram.exe creates files with a Zone.Identifier, indicating a download.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary using Telegram to download
  malicious tools, such as network scanners, for further exploitation. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to network mapping, lateral movement, and potential
  compromise of additional systems within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 15
search: '`sysmon` EventCode= 15 process_name = "telegram.exe" TargetFilename = "*:Zone.Identifier"
  |stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest EventCode process_name
  process_id TargetFilename Hash | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `download_files_using_telegram_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and TargetFilename from your endpoints or Events that
  monitor filestream events which is happened when process download something. (EventCode
  15) If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon
  TA.
known_false_positives: normal download of file in telegram app. (if it was a common
  app in network)
