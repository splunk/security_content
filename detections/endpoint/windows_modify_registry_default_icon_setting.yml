description: This analytic is developed to detect suspicious registry modification
  to change the default icon association of windows to ransomware . This technique
  was seen in Lockbit ransomware where it modified the default icon association of
  the compromised Windows OS  host with its dropped ransomware icon file as part of
  its  defacement payload. This registry is not commonly modified by a normal user
  so having this anomaly detection may help to catch possible lockbit ransomware infection
  or other malware.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path
  ="*\\defaultIcon\\(Default)*" Registry.registry_path = "*HKCR\\*" by Registry.registry_path
  Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name Registry.action Registry.dest  Registry.user
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)`
  | `windows_modify_registry_default_icon_setting_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
