description: The following analytic detects suspicious modifications to the Windows
  registry's default icon settings, a technique associated with Lockbit ransomware.
  It leverages data from the Endpoint Registry data model, focusing on changes to
  registry paths under "*HKCR\\*\\defaultIcon\\(Default)*". This activity is significant
  as it is uncommon for normal users to modify these settings, and such changes can
  indicate ransomware infection or other malware. If confirmed malicious, this could
  lead to system defacement and signal a broader ransomware attack, potentially compromising
  sensitive data and system integrity.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path
  ="*\\defaultIcon\\(Default)*" Registry.registry_path = "*HKCR\\*" by Registry.registry_path

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
