description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments used to enumerate domain users via the `Get-DomainUser` command.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and command-line executions mapped to the `Processes`
  node of the `Endpoint` data model. This activity is significant as it indicates
  potential reconnaissance efforts by adversaries or Red Teams using PowerView for
  Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to
  gain situational awareness and identify valuable targets within the domain, potentially
  leading to further exploitation.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="cmd.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="powershell*") AND Processes.process = "*Get-DomainUser*"

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
