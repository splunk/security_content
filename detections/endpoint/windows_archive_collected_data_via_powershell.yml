- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell script that archive files to a temp folder. 
  This anomaly detection serves as a valuable indicator to uncover threats from adversaries utilizing PowerShell scripts 
  for data archiving purposes. Identifying this method becomes pivotal in flagging and investigating potential threats, 
  enabling proactive measures threat actors leveraging similar PowerShell-based data collection and archiving techniques.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
