description: The following analytic identifies potential enumeration of local network
  configuration on Linux systems. It detects this activity by monitoring processes
  such as "arp," "ifconfig," "ip," "netstat," "firewall-cmd," "ufw," "iptables," "ss,"
  and "route" within a 30-minute window. This behavior is significant as it often
  indicates reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to gather network information for
  subsequent attacks. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable attackers
  to map the network, identify vulnerabilities, and plan further exploitation or lateral
  movement within the environment.

  as process_name_list values(Processes.process) as process_list values(Processes.process_id)

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
