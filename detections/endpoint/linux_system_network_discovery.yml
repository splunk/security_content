- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to look for possible enumeration of local network configuration.
  This technique is commonly used as part of recon of adversaries or threat actor
  to know some network information for its next or further attack. This anomaly detections
  may capture normal event made by administrator during auditing or testing network
  connection of specific host or network to network.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name_list values(Processes.process) as process_list values(Processes.process_id)
  as process_id_list values(Processes.parent_process_id) as parent_process_id_list
  values(Processes.process_guid) as process_guid_list dc(Processes.process_name) as
  process_name_count from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name
  IN ("arp", "ifconfig", "ip", "netstat", "firewall-cmd", "ufw", "iptables", "ss",
  "route") by _time span=30m Processes.dest Processes.user | where process_name_count
  >=4 | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`| `linux_system_network_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
