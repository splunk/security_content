status: experimental
type: Hunting
data_source: []
description: The following hunting query utilizes a PowerShell Scripted input that captures the bootloader paths for each Windows endpoint it is deployed to. The template inputs.conf is located in the references link.
  By default, it only captures the path, but may be modified to capture everything that BCDedit provides. It can be verbose, but may be worth it.
search: '`bootloader_inventory` | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(_raw) by host | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_bootloader_inventory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, a new stanza will need to be added to a inputs.conf and deployed to all or some Windows endpoints. https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/26518cd2844b0e03de6126660bb45707 provides the stanza. If modifying the sourcetype, be sure to update the Macro for this analytic. Recommend running it daily, or weekly, depending on threat model.
known_false_positives: No false positives here, only bootloaders. Filter as needed or create a lookup as a baseline.
