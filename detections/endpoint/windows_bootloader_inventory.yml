description: The following analytic identifies the bootloader paths on Windows endpoints.
  It leverages a PowerShell Scripted input to capture this data, which is then processed
  and aggregated using Splunk. Monitoring bootloader paths is significant for a SOC
  as it helps detect unauthorized modifications that could indicate bootkits or other
  persistent threats. If confirmed malicious, such activity could allow attackers
  to maintain persistence, bypass security controls, and potentially control the boot
  process, leading to full system compromise.
search: '`bootloader_inventory` | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime values(_raw) by host | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_bootloader_inventory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, a new stanza will need to be added to
  a inputs.conf and deployed to all or some Windows endpoints. https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/26518cd2844b0e03de6126660bb45707
  provides the stanza. If modifying the sourcetype, be sure to update the Macro for
  this analytic. Recommend running it daily, or weekly, depending on threat model.
known_false_positives: No false positives here, only bootloaders. Filter as needed
  or create a lookup as a baseline.
