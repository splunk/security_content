description: This search looks for child processes of spoolsv.exe. This activity is
  associated with a POC privilege-escalation exploit associated with CVE-2018-8440.
  Spoolsv.exe is the process associated with the Print Spooler service in Windows
  and typically runs as SYSTEM.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate printer-related processes may show up as children
  of spoolsv.exe. You should confirm that any activity as legitimate and may be added
  as exclusions in the search.
