type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies child processes spawned by spoolsv.exe,
  the Print Spooler service in Windows, which typically runs with SYSTEM privileges.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process and parent process relationships. Monitoring this activity is
  crucial as it can indicate exploitation attempts, such as those associated with
  CVE-2018-8440, which can lead to privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, attackers
  could gain SYSTEM-level access, allowing them to execute arbitrary code, escalate
  privileges, and potentially compromise the entire system.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=spoolsv.exe

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate printer-related processes may show up as children
  of spoolsv.exe. You should confirm that any activity as legitimate and may be added
  as exclusions in the search.
