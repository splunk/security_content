datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: this search is to detect a suspicious regsvr32 commandline "-s" to execute
  a dll files. This technique was seen in IcedID malware to execute its initial downloader
  dll that will download the 2nd stage loader that will download and decrypt the config
  payload.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32`
  (Processes.process="*/i*" AND Processes.process="*/s*") OR Processes.process="*/si*" OR Processes.process="*-si*" by Processes.dest Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `regsvr32_with_known_silent_switch_cmdline_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: minimal. but network operator can use this application to load
  dll.
