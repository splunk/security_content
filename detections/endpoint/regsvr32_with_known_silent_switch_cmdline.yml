description: The following analytic identifies Regsvr32.exe utilizing the silent switch
  to load DLLs. This technique has most recently been seen in IcedID campaigns to
  load its initial dll that will download the 2nd stage loader that will download
  and decrypt the config payload. The switch type may be either a hyphen `-` or forward
  slash `/`. This behavior is typically found with `-s`, and it is possible there
  are more switch types that may be used. \ During triage, review parallel processes
  and capture any artifacts that may have landed on disk. Isolate and contain the
  endpoint as necessary.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` by Processes.user
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.dest Processes.process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | where match(process,"(?i)[\-|\/][Ss]{1}")
  | `regsvr32_with_known_silent_switch_cmdline_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: minimal. but network operator can use this application to load
  dll.
