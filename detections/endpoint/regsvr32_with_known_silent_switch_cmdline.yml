description: The following analytic detects the execution of Regsvr32.exe with the
  silent switch to load DLLs. This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line executions containing the
  `-s` or `/s` switches. This activity is significant as it is commonly used in malware
  campaigns, such as IcedID, to stealthily load malicious DLLs. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, download additional payloads,
  and potentially compromise the system further. Immediate investigation and endpoint
  isolation are recommended.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` by Processes.user
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.dest Processes.process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | where match(process,"(?i)[\-|\/][Ss]{1}")
  | `regsvr32_with_known_silent_switch_cmdline_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: minimal. but network operator can use this application to load
  dll.
