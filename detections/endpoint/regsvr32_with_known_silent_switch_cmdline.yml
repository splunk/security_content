description: The following analytic detects the execution of Regsvr32.exe with the silent switch to load DLLs. This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line executions containing the `-s` or `/s` switches. This activity is significant as it is commonly used in malware campaigns, such as IcedID, to stealthily load malicious DLLs. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, download additional payloads, and potentially compromise the system further. Immediate investigation and endpoint isolation are recommended.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: minimal. but network operator can use this application to load dll.
