description: The following analytic identifies Regsvr32.exe utilizing the silent switch
  to load DLLs. This technique has most recently been seen in IcedID campaigns to
  load its initial dll that will download the 2nd stage loader that will download
  and decrypt the config payload. The switch type may be either a hyphen `-` or forward
  slash `/`. This behavior is typically found with `-s`, and it is possible there
  are more switch types that may be used. \ During triage, review parallel processes
  and capture any artifacts that may have landed on disk. Isolate and contain the
  endpoint as necessary.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` by Processes.user
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.dest Processes.process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | where match(process,"(?i)[\-|\/][Ss]{1}")
  | `regsvr32_with_known_silent_switch_cmdline_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: minimal. but network operator can use this application to load
  dll.
