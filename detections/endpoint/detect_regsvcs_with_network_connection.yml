description: The following analytic identifies instances of Regsvcs.exe establishing
  a network connection to a public IP address, excluding private IP ranges. This detection
  leverages Sysmon Event ID 3 logs to monitor network connections initiated by Regsvcs.exe.
  This activity is significant as Regsvcs.exe, a legitimate Microsoft-signed binary,
  can be exploited to bypass application control mechanisms and establish remote Command
  and Control (C2) channels. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an
  attacker to escalate privileges, persist in the environment, and exfiltrate sensitive
  data. Immediate investigation and remediation are recommended.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 3
search: '`sysmon` EventID=3 dest_ip!=10.0.0.0/8 dest_ip!=172.16.0.0/12 dest_ip!=192.168.0.0/16
  process_name=regsvcs.exe  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by dest, user, process_name, src_ip, dest_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_regsvcs_with_network_connection_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, limited instances of regsvcs.exe may cause
  a false positive. Filter based endpoint usage, command line arguments, or process
  lineage.
