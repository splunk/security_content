description: The following analytic identifies instances where three or more distinct
  registry modification events associated with MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1112 are detected.
  It leverages data from the Risk data model in Splunk, focusing on registry-related
  sources and MITRE technique annotations. This activity is significant because multiple
  registry modifications can indicate an attempt to persist, hide malicious configurations,
  or erase forensic evidence. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
  to maintain persistent access, execute malicious code, and evade detection, posing
  a severe threat to the integrity and security of the affected host.

how_to_implement: Splunk Enterprise Security is required to utilize this correlation.
  In addition, modify the source_count value to your environment. In our testing,
  a count of 4 or 5 was decent in a lab, but the number may need to be increased base
  on internal testing. In addition, based on false positives, modify any analytics
  to be anomaly and lower or increase risk based on organization importance.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on many factors. Tune
  the correlation as needed to reduce too many triggers.
