description: The following analytic detects the execution of `wmic.exe` with specific
  command-line arguments used to discover remote systems within a domain. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
  and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
  reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to map out network resources and Active Directory
  structures. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to gain
  situational awareness, identify critical systems, and plan further attacks, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="wmic.exe")
  (Processes.process=*/NAMESPACE:\\\\root\\directory\\ldap* AND Processes.process=*ds_computer*
  AND Processes.process="*GET ds_samaccountname*") by Processes.dest Processes.user

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_system_discovery_with_wmic_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
