description: Attackers often disable security tools to avoid detection. This search
  looks for the usage of process `fltMC.exe` to unload a Sysmon Driver that will stop
  sysmon from collecting the data.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime values(Processes.process)
  as process max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=fltMC.exe
  AND Processes.process=*unload* AND Processes.process=*SysmonDrv*  by Processes.process_name
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process Processes.dest
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |`unload_sysmon_filter_driver_filter`| table firstTime lastTime dest user count
  process_name process_id parent_process_name process'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model. This search is also shipped with `unload_sysmon_filter_driver_filter` macro,
  update this macro to filter out false positives.
