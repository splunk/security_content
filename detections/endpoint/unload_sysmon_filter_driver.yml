description: The following analytic detects the use of `fltMC.exe` to unload the Sysmon
  driver, which stops Sysmon from collecting data. It leverages Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) logs, focusing on process names and command-line executions.
  This activity is significant because disabling Sysmon can blind security monitoring,
  allowing malicious actions to go undetected. If confirmed malicious, this could
  enable attackers to execute further attacks without being logged, leading to potential
  data breaches, privilege escalation, or persistent access within the environment.

- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime values(Processes.process)
  as process max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=fltMC.exe
  AND Processes.process=*unload* AND Processes.process=*SysmonDrv*  by Processes.process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
