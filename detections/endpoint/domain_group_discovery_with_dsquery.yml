description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `dsquery.exe` with
  command-line arguments used to query for domain groups. It leverages Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This
  activity is significant because both Red Teams and adversaries use `dsquery.exe`
  to enumerate domain groups, gaining situational awareness and facilitating further
  Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
  to map out the domain structure, identify high-value targets, and plan subsequent
  attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="dsquery.exe")
  (Processes.process="*group*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
