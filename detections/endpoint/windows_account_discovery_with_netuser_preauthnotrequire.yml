description: The following analytic detects the execution of the PowerView PowerShell
  cmdlet Get-NetUser with the -PreauthNotRequire parameter, leveraging Event ID 4104.
  This method identifies attempts to query Active Directory user accounts that do
  not require Kerberos preauthentication. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it
  can indicate reconnaissance efforts by an attacker to identify potentially vulnerable
  accounts. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to further exploitation,
  such as unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the network.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.=
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerView for legitimate purposes,
  filter as needed.
