description: This analytic looks for audit policies being disabled on a domain controller.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4719 (AuditPolicyChanges IN ("%%8448","%%8450","%%8448,
  %%8450") OR Changes IN ("Failure removed","Success removed","Success removed, Failure
  removed")) dest_category="domain_controller"

  | replace "%%8448" with "Success removed", "%%8450" with "Failure removed", "%%8448,
  %%8450" with "Success removed, Failure removed" in AuditPolicyChanges

  | eval AuditPolicyChanges=coalesce(AuditPolicyChanges,Changes), SubcategoryGuid=coalesce(SubcategoryGuid,Subcategory_GUID)

  | stats min(_time) as _time values(host) as dest by AuditPolicyChanges SubcategoryGuid

  | lookup auditpolicyguids_lookup GUID as SubcategoryGuid OUTPUT Category SubCategory

how_to_implement: Ensure you are ingesting EventCode `4719` from your domain controllers, the category domain_controller exists
  in assets and identities, and that assets and identities is enabled. If A&I is not configured, you will need to manually filter the results 
  within the base search.
