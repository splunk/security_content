description: The following analytic detects the disabling of audit policies on a domain
  controller. It leverages EventCode 4719 from Windows Security Event Logs to identify
  changes where success or failure auditing is removed. This activity is significant
  as it suggests an attacker may have gained access to the domain controller and is
  attempting to evade detection by tampering with audit policies. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to severe consequences, including data theft, privilege escalation,
  and full network compromise. Immediate investigation is required to determine the
  source and intent of the change.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4719 (AuditPolicyChanges IN ("%%8448","%%8450","%%8448,
  %%8450") OR Changes IN ("Failure removed","Success removed","Success removed, Failure
  removed")) dest_category="domain_controller"| replace "%%8448" with "Success removed",
  "%%8450" with "Failure removed", "%%8448, %%8450" with "Success removed, Failure
  removed" in AuditPolicyChanges | eval AuditPolicyChanges=coalesce(AuditPolicyChanges,Changes),
  SubcategoryGuid=coalesce(SubcategoryGuid,Subcategory_GUID) | stats min(_time) as
  _time values(host) as dest by AuditPolicyChanges SubcategoryGuid | lookup advanced_audit_policy_guids
  GUID as SubcategoryGuid OUTPUT Category SubCategory | `windows_ad_domain_controller_audit_policy_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: Ensure you are ingesting EventCode `4719` from your domain controllers,
  the category domain_controller exists in assets and identities, and that assets
  and identities is enabled. If A&I is not configured, you will need to manually filter
  the results within the base search.
