datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This query detects the Nishang Invoke-PowerShellTCPOneLine utility that
  spawns a call back to a remote command and control server. This is a powershell
  oneliner. In addition, this will capture on the command-line additional utilities
  used by Nishang. Triage the endpoint and identify any parallel processes that look
  suspicious. Review the reputation of the remote IP or domain contacted by the powershell
  process.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell` (Processes.process=*Net.Sockets.TCPClient*
  AND Processes.process=*System.Text.ASCIIEncoding*) by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `nishang_powershelltcponeline_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present. Filter as needed based
  on initial analysis.
