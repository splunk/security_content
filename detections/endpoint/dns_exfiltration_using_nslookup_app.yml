description: The following analytic identifies potential DNS exfiltration using the nslookup application. It detects specific command-line parameters such as query type (TXT, A, AAAA) and retry options, which are commonly used by attackers to exfiltrate data. The detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process execution logs. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server or exfiltrate sensitive data. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to critical information.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
