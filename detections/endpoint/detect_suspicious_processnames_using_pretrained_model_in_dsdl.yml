description: The following analytic identifies suspicious process names using a pre-trained
  Deep Learning model. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry
  to analyze process names and predict their likelihood of being malicious. The model,
  a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), classifies process names as benign
  or suspicious based on a threshold score of 0.5. This detection is significant as
  it helps identify malware, such as TrickBot, which often uses randomly generated
  filenames to evade detection. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate
  the presence of malware capable of propagating across the network and executing
  harmful actions.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if a suspicious processname
  is similar to a benign processname.
