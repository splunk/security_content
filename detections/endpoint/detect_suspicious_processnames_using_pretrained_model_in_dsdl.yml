description: The following analytic uses a pre-trained Deep Learning model to predict
  whether a processname is suspicious or not. Malwares and malicious programs such
  as ransomware often use tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) such as copying
  malicious files to the local machine to propagate themselves across the network.
  A key indicator of compromise is that after a successful execution of the malware,
  it copies itself as an executable file with a randomly generated filename and places
  this file in one of the directories. Such techniques are seen in several malwares
  such as TrickBot. We develop machine learning model that uses a Recurrent Neural
  Network (RNN) to distinguish between malicious and benign processnames. The model
  is trained independently and is then made available for download. We use a character
  level RNN to classify malicious vs. benign processnames. The higher is_malicious_prob,
  the more likely is the processname to be suspicious (between [0,1]). The threshold
  for flagging a processname as suspicious is set as 0.5.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if a suspicious processname
  is similar to a benign processname.
