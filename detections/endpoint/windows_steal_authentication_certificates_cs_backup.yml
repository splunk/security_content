description: The following analytic identifies the backup of the Active Directory
  Certificate Services (AD CS) store, detected via Event ID 4876. This event is logged
  when a backup is performed using the CertSrv.msc UI or the CertUtil.exe -BackupDB
  command. Monitoring this activity is crucial as unauthorized backups can indicate
  an attempt to steal authentication certificates, which are critical for secure communications.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to impersonate users,
  escalate privileges, or access sensitive information, severely compromising the
  security of the environment.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4876
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4876| stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest, name, action, Caller_Domain ,Caller_User_Name |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_steal_authentication_certificates_cs_backup_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, enhanced Audit Logging must be enabled
  on AD CS and within Group Policy Management for CS server. See Page 128 of first
  reference.
known_false_positives: False positives will be generated based on normal certificate
  store backups. Leave enabled to generate Risk, as this is meant to be an anomaly
  analytic. If CS backups are not normal, enable as TTP.
