status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies when the Active Directory Certificate
  Services store is backed up utilizing Event ID 4876. This event triggers whenever
  the backup occurs in the UI of CertSrv.msc or via CertUtil.exe -BackupDB occurs.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4876
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4876| stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest, name, action, Caller_Domain ,Caller_User_Name |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_steal_authentication_certificates_cs_backup_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, enhanced Audit Logging must be enabled
  on AD CS and within Group Policy Management for CS server. See Page 128 of first
  reference.
known_false_positives: False positives will be generated based on normal certificate
  store backups. Leave enabled to generate Risk, as this is meant to be an anomaly
  analytic. If CS backups are not normal, enable as TTP.
