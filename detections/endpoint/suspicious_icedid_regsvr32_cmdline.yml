description: this search is to detect a suspicious regsvr32 commandline "-s" to execute
  a dll files. This technique was seen in IcedID malware to execute its initial downloader
  dll that will download the 2nd stage loader that will download and decrypt the config
  payload.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=regsvr32.exe
  Processes.process=*-s* by  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.dest
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_icedid_regsvr32_cmdline_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed regsvr32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: minimal. but network operator can use this application to load
  dll.
