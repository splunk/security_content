- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the PowerView PowerShell
  cmdlet Get-NetComputer, which is used to query Active Directory for user account
  details such as "samaccountname," "accountexpires," "lastlogon," and more. It leverages
  Event ID 4104 from PowerShell Script Block Logging to identify this activity. This
  behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to gather user account information,
  which is often a precursor to further malicious actions. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or lateral
  movement within the network.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104  ScriptBlockText = "*Get-NetComputer*" ScriptBlockText
  IN ("*samaccountname*", "*accountexpires*", "*lastlogon*", "*lastlogoff*", "*pwdlastset*",
  "*logoncount*") | rename Computer as dest, UserID as user | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText dest user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_domain_account_discovery_via_get_netcomputer_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.=
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerView for legitimate purposes,
  filter as needed.
