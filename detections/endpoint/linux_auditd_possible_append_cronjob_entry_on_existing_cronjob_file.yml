description: The following analytic detects potential tampering with cronjob files
  on a Linux system by identifying 'echo' commands that append code to existing cronjob
  files. It leverages logs from Linux Auditd, focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line executions. This activity is
  significant because adversaries often use it for persistence or privilege escalation.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute unauthorized code
  automatically, leading to system compromises and unauthorized data access, thereby
  impacting business operations and data integrity.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Path
search: '`linux_auditd` type=PATH name IN("*/etc/cron*", "*/var/spool/cron/*", "*/etc/anacrontab*")
  | rename host as dest | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by name nametype OGID  dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `linux_auditd_possible_append_cronjob_entry_on_existing_cronjob_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: False positives may arise from legitimate actions by administrators
  or network operators who may use these commands for automation purposes. Therefore,
  it's recommended to adjust filter macros to eliminate such false positives.
