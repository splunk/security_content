description: The following analytic identifies a LOLBAS process being executed outside of it's expected location. Processes being executed outside of expected locations may be an indicator that an adversary is attempting to evade defenses or execute malicious code. The LOLBAS project documents Windows native binaries that can be abused by threat actors to perform tasks like executing malicious code.

how_to_implement: To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process name and process path, such as with Sysmon EID 1.  
known_false_positives: Vendors will often copy system exectables to a different path for application usage.
