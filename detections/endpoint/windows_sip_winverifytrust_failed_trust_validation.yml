- Windows Event Log CAPI2 81
description: The following analytic detects failed trust validation attempts using
  Windows Event Log - CAPI2 (CryptoAPI 2). It specifically triggers on EventID 81,
  which indicates that "The digital signature of the object did not verify." This
  detection leverages the CAPI2 Operational log to identify instances where digital
  signatures fail to validate. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can indicate
  attempts to execute untrusted or potentially malicious binaries. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow attackers to bypass security controls and execute unauthorized
  code, leading to potential system compromise.

  lastTime by Computer, UserData_Xml | rename Computer as dest | `windows_sip_winverifytrust_failed_trust_validation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, one will need to enable the Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational
  log within the Windows Event Log. Note this is a debug log for many purposes, and
  the analytic only focuses in on EventID 81. Review the following gist for additional
  enabling information.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present in some instances of legitimate
  binaries with invalid signatures. Filter as needed.
