data_source:
- Windows Event Log CAPI2 81
description: The following analytic utilizes a Windows Event Log - CAPI2 - or CryptoAPI 2, to identify failed trust validation. Typically, this event log is meant for diagnosing PKI issues, however is a great source to identify failed trust validation. Note that this event log is noisy as it captures common PKI requests from many different processes. EventID 81 is generated anytime a trust validation fails. The description for EventID 81 is "The digital signature of the object did not verify." STRT tested this analytic using Mimikatz binary.
search: '`capi2_operational` EventID=81 "The digital signature of the object did not verify." | xmlkv UserData_Xml | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, UserData_Xml | rename Computer as dest | `windows_sip_winverifytrust_failed_trust_validation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, one will need to enable the Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational
  log within the Windows Event Log. Note this is a debug log for many purposes, and
  the analytic only focuses in on EventID 81. Review the following gist for additional
  enabling information.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present in some instances of legitimate binaries with invalid signatures. Filter as needed.
