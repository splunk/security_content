description: The following analytic identifies a renamed instance of microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe.
  Microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319
  and is rarely utilized. When investigating, identify the executed code on disk and
  review. A spawned child process from microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe is uncommon.
  In any instance, microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe spawning from an Office product
  or any living off the land binary is highly suspect.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name!=microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe
  AND Processes.original_file_name=Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_microsoft_workflow_compiler_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe, triggering a false positive.
