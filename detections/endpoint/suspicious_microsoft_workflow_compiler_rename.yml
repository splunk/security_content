description: The following analytic detects the renaming of microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe,
  a rarely used executable typically located in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319.
  This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on
  process names and original file names. This activity is significant because renaming
  this executable can indicate an attempt to evade security controls. If confirmed
  malicious, an attacker could use this renamed executable to execute arbitrary code,
  potentially leading to privilege escalation or persistent access within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name!=microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe
  AND Processes.original_file_name=Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_microsoft_workflow_compiler_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe, triggering a false positive.
