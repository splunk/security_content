description: The following analytic identifies the execution of CLOP ransomware variants
  using specific arguments ("runrun" or "temp.dat") to trigger their malicious activities.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and command-line arguments. Monitoring this activity is
  crucial as it indicates potential ransomware behavior, which can lead to file encryption
  on network shares or local machines. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  result in significant data loss and operational disruption due to encrypted files,
  highlighting the need for immediate investigation and response.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name != "*temp.dat*"
  Processes.process = "*runrun*" OR Processes.process = "*temp.dat*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `clop_common_exec_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Operators can execute third party tools using these parameters.
