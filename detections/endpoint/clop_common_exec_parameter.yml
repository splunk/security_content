datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytics are designed to identifies some CLOP ransomware
  variant that using arguments to execute its main code or feature of its code. In
  this variant if the parameter is "runrun", CLOP ransomware will try to encrypt files
  in network shares and if it is "temp.dat", it will try to read from some stream
  pipe or file start encrypting files within the infected local machines. This technique
  can be also identified as an anti-sandbox technique to make its code non-responsive
  since it is waiting for some parameter to execute properly.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as cmdline
  values(Processes.parent_process_name) as parent_process values(Processes.process_name)
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name != "*temp.dat*" Processes.process = "*runrun*" OR Processes.process
  = "*temp.dat*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `clop_common_exec_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Operators can execute third party tools using these parameters.
