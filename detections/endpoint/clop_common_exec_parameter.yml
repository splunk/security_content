description: The following analytics are designed to identifies some CLOP ransomware
  variant that using arguments to execute its main code or feature of its code. In
  this variant if the parameter is "runrun", CLOP ransomware will try to encrypt files
  in network shares and if it is "temp.dat", it will try to read from some stream
  pipe or file start encrypting files within the infected local machines. This technique
  can be also identified as an anti-sandbox technique to make its code non-responsive
  since it is waiting for some parameter to execute properly.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name != "*temp.dat*"
  Processes.process = "*runrun*" OR Processes.process = "*temp.dat*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `clop_common_exec_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Operators can execute third party tools using these parameters.
