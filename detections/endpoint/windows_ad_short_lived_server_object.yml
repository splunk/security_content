description: 'The following analytic identifies a change in an Active Directory environment that could represent evidence of the DCShadow attack.  
  DCShadow allows an attacker who has obtained privileged access to register a rogue Domain Controller (DC). Once registered, the rogue DC may be able to inject
  and replicate changes in the AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys. This technique was initially released in 2018 by security 
  researchers Benjamin Delpy and Vincent Le Toux. Specifically, the detection will trigger when a possible rogue Domain Controller
  computer object is created and quickly deleted within 30 seconds or less in an Active Directory domain. This behavior was identfied by simulating the DCShadow attack with
  Mimikatz.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting Event codes 
 `5137` and `5141`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes` 
 within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. For these event codes to be generated, specific SACLs are required.
known_false_positives: Creating and deleting a server object within 30 seconds or less is unusual but not impossible in a production environment. Filter as needed.
