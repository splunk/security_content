description: 'The following analytic identifies the creation and quick deletion of
  a Domain Controller (DC) object within 30 seconds in an Active Directory environment,
  indicative of a potential DCShadow attack. This detection leverages Windows Security
  Event Codes 5137 and 5141, analyzing the duration between these events. This activity
  is significant as DCShadow allows attackers with privileged access to register a
  rogue DC, enabling unauthorized changes to AD objects, including credentials. If
  confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized AD modifications, compromising
  the integrity and security of the entire domain.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting Event
  codes `5137` and `5141`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory
  Services Changes` within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. For these event codes
  to be generated, specific SACLs are required.
known_false_positives: Creating and deleting a server object within 30 seconds or
  less is unusual but not impossible in a production environment. Filter as needed.
