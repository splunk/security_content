type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies when the Task Scheduler service "svchost.exe
  -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule" is the parent process to common command line, scripting,
  or shell execution binaries. Attackers often abuse the task scheduler service with
  these binaries as an execution and persistence mechanism in order to blend in with
  normal Windows operations. This TTP is also commonly seen for legitimate purposes
  such as business scripts or application updates.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Unknown, possible custom scripting.
