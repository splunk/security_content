description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry entry "EnableWebContentEvaluation" to disable Windows Defender web content evaluation. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically monitoring changes where the registry value is set to "0x00000000". This activity is significant as it indicates an attempt to impair browser security features, potentially allowing malicious web content to bypass security checks. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to users interacting with harmful scripts or unsafe web elements, increasing the risk of system exploitation and security breaches.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry WHERE Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\AppHost\\EnableWebContentEvaluation"  Registry.registry_value_data= "0x00000000" BY _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_disable_web_evaluation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro to tune the search.
