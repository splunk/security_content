description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to disable Windows Defender 
  web content evaluation. The "EnableWebContentEvaluation" registry entry typically relates to security settings 
  within Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer, enabling the evaluation of web content for security purposes.
  When attackers modify "EnableWebContentEvaluation" to 0, they might attempt to disable the browser's 
  capability to evaluate web content for security purposes. Disabling this feature could potentially impact 
  the browser's ability to assess the security risks associated with web content, such as potentially malicious scripts, 
  active content, or unsafe web elements.
  By turning off content evaluation, attackers might aim to exploit security vulnerabilities present in web content without 
  triggering security warnings or blocks. This manipulation increases the risk of users accessing or interacting with malicious 
  content, potentially leading to security compromises or system exploitation.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  WHERE Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\AppHost\\EnableWebContentEvaluation"  Registry.registry_value_data= "0x00000000" 
  BY _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
