description: This search is to detect a COM CLSID execution through powershell. This
  technique was seen in several adversaries and malware like ransomware conti where
  it has a feature to execute command using COM Object. This technique may use by
  network operator at some cases but a good indicator if some application want to
  gain privilege escalation or bypass uac.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 Message = "*CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromCLSID*"
  OR Message = "*CreateInstance([Type]::GetTypeFromProgID*"| stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Message ComputerName User | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `powershell_execute_com_object_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network operrator may use this command.
