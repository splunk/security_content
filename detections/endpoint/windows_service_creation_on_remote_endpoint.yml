description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a Windows Service on
  a remote endpoint using `sc.exe`. It detects this activity by analyzing process
  execution logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  arguments that include remote paths and service creation commands. This behavior
  is significant because adversaries often exploit the Service Control Manager for
  lateral movement and remote code execution. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on remote systems, potentially leading
  to further compromise and persistence within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may create Windows Services on remote systems,
  but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
