description: The following analytic detects the use of the findstr command to search
  for unsecured credentials in Group Policy Preferences (GPP). It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
  involving findstr.exe with references to SYSVOL and cpassword. This activity is
  significant because it indicates an attempt to locate and potentially decrypt embedded
  credentials in GPP, which could lead to unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to escalate privileges or gain access to sensitive
  systems and data within the domain.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=findstr.exe
  AND Processes.process=*sysvol* AND Processes.process=*cpassword*) by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name |
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_findstr_gpp_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage findstr to find passwords in GPO
  to validate exposure. Filter as needed.
