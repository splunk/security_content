description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows Error Reporting
  registry key "DontShowUI" to suppress error reporting dialogs. It leverages data
  from the Endpoint datamodel's Registry node to identify changes where the registry
  value is set to 0x00000001. This activity is significant as it is commonly associated
  with DarkGate malware, which uses this modification to avoid detection during its
  installation. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to maintain
  a low profile, avoiding user alerts and potentially enabling further malicious activities
  without user intervention.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path = "*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows
  Error Reporting\\DontShowUI"  Registry.registry_value_data = 0x00000001 by  Registry.registry_path

  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_dontshowui_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
