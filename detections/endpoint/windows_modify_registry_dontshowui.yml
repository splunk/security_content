description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows Error Reporting registry to DontShowUI.
  DarkGate malware modify this registry as part of its malicious installation in a targeted host for its remote desktop capabilities.
  When this registry value is present and set to a specific configuration, it can influence the behavior of error reporting dialogs or prompts, 
  suppressing them from being displayed to the user.For instance, setting DontShowUI to a value of 1 often indicates that the 
  Windows Error Reporting UI prompts will be suppressed, meaning users won't see error reporting pop-ups when errors occur.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
