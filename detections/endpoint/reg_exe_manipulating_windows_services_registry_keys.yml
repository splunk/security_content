description: The following analytic detects the use of reg.exe to modify registry
  keys associated with Windows services and their configurations. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent
  processes, and command-line executions. This activity is significant because unauthorized
  changes to service registry keys can indicate an attempt to establish persistence
  or escalate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to
  control service behavior, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution or
  system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is unusual for a service to be created or modified by directly
  manipulating the registry. However, there may be legitimate instances of this behavior.
  It is important to validate and investigate, as appropriate.
