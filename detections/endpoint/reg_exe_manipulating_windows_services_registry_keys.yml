description: The search looks for reg.exe modifying registry keys that define Windows
  services and their configurations.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(Processes.process_name) as process_name values(Processes.parent_process_name)
  as parent_process_name values(Processes.user) as user FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=reg.exe Processes.process=*reg* Processes.process=*add*
  Processes.process=*Services* by Processes.process_id Processes.dest Processes.process
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `reg_exe_manipulating_windows_services_registry_keys_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: It is unusual for a service to be created or modified by directly
  manipulating the registry. However, there may be legitimate instances of this behavior.
  It is important to validate and investigate, as appropriate.
