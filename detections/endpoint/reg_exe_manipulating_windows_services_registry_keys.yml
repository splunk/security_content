description: The search looks for reg.exe modifying registry keys that define Windows
  services and their configurations.
id: 8470d755-0c13-45b3-bd63-387a373c10cf
known_false_positives: It is unusual for a service to be created or modified by directly
  manipulating the registry. However, there may be legitimate instances of this behavior.
  It is important to validate and investigate, as appropriate.
