description: The following analytic detects the use of Windows Management Instrumentation
  Command-line (WMIC) to retrieve information about running processes, specifically
  targeting the command lines used to launch those processes. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on logs containing
  process details and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it
  may indicate suspicious behavior, such as a user or process gathering detailed process
  information, which is uncommon for non-technical users. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to gain insights into running processes, aiding in
  further exploitation or lateral movement.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_wmic` Processes.process=
  "* process *" Processes.process= "* get commandline *" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_process_commandline_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
