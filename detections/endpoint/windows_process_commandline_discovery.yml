description: The following analytic detects Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) command 
  used to retrieve information about running processes and specifically fetches the command lines used to launch those processes.
  This Hunting detection can be a good indicator for possible suspicious user or process getting list of process with its command line using wmic application which is not a 
  common practice for a non-technical user.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where `process_wmic` Processes.process= "* process *" Processes.process= "* get commandline *" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_process_commandline_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting. Filter as needed.
