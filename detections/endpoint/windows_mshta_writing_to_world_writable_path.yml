description: The following analytic identifies instances of `mshta.exe` writing files
  to world-writable directories. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 11 logs to detect file
  write operations by `mshta.exe` to directories like `C:\Windows\Tasks` and `C:\Windows\Temp`.
  This activity is significant as it often indicates an attempt to establish persistence
  or execute malicious code, deviating from the utility's legitimate use. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to the execution of multi-stage payloads, potentially
  resulting in full system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

how_to_implement: The analytic is designed to be run against Sysmon event logs collected
  from endpoints. The analytic requires the Sysmon event logs to be ingested into
  Splunk. The search focuses on EventCode 11 where the Image is `mshta.exe` and the
  TargetFilename is within world-writable directories such as `C:\Windows\Tasks`,
  `C:\Windows\Temp`, and others. The detection is designed to catch the initial file
  write operation by `mshta.exe` to these locations, which is indicative of an attempt
  to establish persistence or execute malicious code. The analytic can be modified
  to include additional world-writable directories as needed.
known_false_positives: False positives may occur if legitimate processes are writing
  to world-writable directories. It is recommended to investigate the context of the
  file write operation to determine if it is malicious or not. Modify the search to
  include additional known good paths for `mshta.exe` to reduce false positives.
