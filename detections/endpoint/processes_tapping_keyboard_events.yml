description: The following analytic detects processes on macOS systems that are tapping
  keyboard events, potentially monitoring all keystrokes made by a user. It leverages
  data from osquery results within the Alerts data model, focusing on specific process
  names and command lines. This activity is significant as it is a common technique
  used by Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to log keystrokes, posing a serious security
  risk. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
  information, including passwords and personal data, compromising the integrity and
  confidentiality of the system.
data_source: []
search: '| from datamodel Alerts.Alerts | search app=osquery:results name=pack_osx-attacks_Keyboard_Event_Taps
  | rename columns.cmdline as cmd, columns.name as process_name, columns.pid as process_id|
  dedup host,process_name | table host,process_name, cmd, process_id | `processes_tapping_keyboard_events_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from your osquery deployed agents with the 
  [osx-attacks.conf](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/blob/experimental/packs/osx-attacks.conf#L599)
  pack enabled. Also the [TA-OSquery](https://github.com/d1vious/TA-osquery) must
  be deployed across your indexers and universal forwarders in order to have the osquery
  data populate the Alerts data model.
known_false_positives: There might be some false positives as keyboard event taps
  are used by processes like Siri and Zoom video chat, for some good examples of processes
  to exclude please see [this](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/pull/5345#issuecomment-454639161)
