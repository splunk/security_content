- Endpoint
description: This analytic looks for the execution of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` with
  command line arguments used to obtain the domain password policy. Red Teams and
  adversaries may leverage `net.exe` for situational awareness and Active Directory
  Discovery.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="net.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="net1.exe") AND Processes.process = "*accounts*" AND Processes.process
  = "*/domain*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `password_policy_discovery_with_net_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
