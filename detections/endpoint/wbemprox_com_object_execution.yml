description: this search is designed to detect potential malicious process loading
  COM object to wbemprox.dll,
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  ImageLoaded IN ("*\\fastprox.dll", "*\\wbemprox.dll",
  "*\\wbemcomn.dll") NOT (process_name IN ("wmiprvse.exe", "WmiApSrv.exe", "unsecapp.exe"))
  NOT(Image IN("*\\windows\\*","*\\program files*", "*\\wbem\\*")) | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded process_name Computer EventCode
  Signed ProcessId Hashes IMPHASH | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `wbemprox_com_object_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: legitimate process that are not in the exception list may trigger
  this event.
