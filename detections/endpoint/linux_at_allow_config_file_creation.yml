type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious file creation of /etc/at.allow
  or /etc/at.deny. These 2 files are commonly abused by malware, adversaries or red
  teamers to persist on the targeted or compromised host. These config files can restrict
  or allow user to execute "at" application (another schedule task application in
  linux). attacker can create a user or add the compromised username to that config
  file to execute "at" to schedule it malicious code. This anomaly detection can be
  a good indicator to investigate further the entry in created config file and who
  created it to verify if it is a false positive.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/at.allow",
  "*/etc/at.deny") by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name
  Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.file_path | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_at_allow_config_file_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create this file for
  automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
