description: The following analytic detects a suspicious modification of the registry aimed at bypassing User Account Control (UAC) by leveraging WSReset.exe. It identifies the creation or modification of specific registry values under the path "*\\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\\Shell\\open\\command*". This detection uses data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and registry events. This activity is significant because UAC bypass techniques can allow attackers to execute high-privilege actions without user consent. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution and potential system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
