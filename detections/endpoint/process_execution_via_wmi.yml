description: The following analytic identifies `WmiPrvSE.exe` spawning a process.
  This typically occurs when a process is instantiated from a local or remote process
  using `wmic.exe`. During triage, review parallel processes for suspicious behavior
  or commands executed. Review the process and command-line spawning from `wmiprvse.exe`.
  Contain and remediate the endpoint as necessary.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=WmiPrvSE.exe
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `process_execution_via_wmi_filter` '
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, administrators may use wmi to execute commands
  for legitimate purposes.
