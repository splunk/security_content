description: The following analytic detects the execution of a process by `WmiPrvSE.exe`,
  indicating potential use of WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) for process
  creation. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process and parent process relationships. This activity is significant
  as WMI can be used for lateral movement, remote code execution, or persistence by
  attackers. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands or scripts, potentially leading to further compromise of the affected system
  or network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=WmiPrvSE.exe
  NOT (Processes.process IN ("*\\dismhost.exe*")) by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `process_execution_via_wmi_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, administrators may use wmi to execute commands
  for legitimate purposes.
