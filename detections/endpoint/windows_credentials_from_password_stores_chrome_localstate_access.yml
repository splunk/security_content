data_source:
- Security Event ID 4663
description: This analytic is designed to detect non-chrome processes accessing the Chrome user data file called "local state." 
  This file contains important settings and information related to the browser's operations on the computer. Threat actors, 
  adversaries, and malware authors have been known to exploit this file in attempts to extract the encrypted master key used for
  decrypting passwords saved in the Chrome browser. Detecting access to the "local state" file by non-chrome processes serves as 
  a valuable pivot for analyzing suspicious processes beyond the commonly observed chrome.exe and explorer.exe executables. 
  By monitoring for this anomaly, we can improve our ability to identify potential threats and safeguard sensitive information stored within the browser.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Uninstall chrome application may access this file and folder path to removed chrome installation in target host. Filter is needed.
