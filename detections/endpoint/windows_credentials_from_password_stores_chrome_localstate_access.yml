data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4663
description: The following analytic detects non-Chrome processes accessing the Chrome
  "Local State" file, which contains critical settings and information. It leverages
  Windows Security Event logs, specifically event code 4663, to identify this behavior.
  This activity is significant because threat actors can exploit this file to extract
  the encrypted master key used for decrypting saved passwords in Chrome. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, posing
  a severe security risk. Monitoring this anomaly helps identify potential threats
  and safeguard browser-stored data.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 object_file_path="*\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User
  Data\\Local State" NOT (process_name IN ("*\\chrome.exe","*:\\Windows\\explorer.exe"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by object_file_name
  object_file_path process_name process_path  process_id EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_credentials_from_password_stores_chrome_localstate_access_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Uninstall chrome application may access this file and folder
  path to removed chrome installation in target host. Filter is needed.
