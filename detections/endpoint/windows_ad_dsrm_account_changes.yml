description: Aside from being used to promote genuine domain controllers, the DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode)
  account can be used to persist within a Domain. A DC can be configured to allow the DSRM account to logon & be
 used in the same way as a local administrator account. This detection is looking for alterations to the behaviour 
 of the account via registry.  
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as _time from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  where Registry.registry_path= "*\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\DSRMAdminLogonBehavior"
  Registry.registry_value_data IN ("*1","*2") by Registry.action Registry.registry_path

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
