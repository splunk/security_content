description: this search is designed to detect potential malicious wermgr.exe process
  that drops or create executable file. Since wermgr.exe is an application trigger
  when error encountered in a process, it is really un ussual to this process to drop
  executable file. This technique is commonly seen in trickbot malware where it injects
  it code to this process to execute it malicious behavior like downloading other
  payload
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11 process_name = "wermgr.exe" TargetFilename = "*.exe"
  | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by  Image TargetFilename
  process_name dest EventCode ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `wermgr_process_create_executable_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
