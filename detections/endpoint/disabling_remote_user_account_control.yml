description: The following analytic identifies modifications to the registry key that
  controls the enforcement of Windows User Account Control (UAC). It detects changes
  to the registry path `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA`
  where the value is set to `0x00000000`. This activity is significant because disabling
  UAC can allow unauthorized changes to the system without user consent, potentially
  leading to privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain
  elevated privileges, making it easier to execute further attacks or maintain persistence
  within the environment.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black, or via other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report registry
  modifications.
known_false_positives: This registry key may be modified via administrators to implement
  a change in system policy. This type of change should be a very rare occurrence.
