description: "The following analytic detects the creation of WMI temporary event subscriptions.
  It leverages Windows Event Logs, specifically EventCode 5860, to identify these
  activities. This detection is significant because attackers often use WMI to execute
  commands, gather information, or maintain persistence within a compromised system.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code, escalate privileges, or persist in the environment. Analysts should review
  the specific WMI queries and assess their intent, considering potential false positives
  from legitimate administrative tasks."
data_source:
- Windows Event Log WMI 5860
search: '`wmi` EventCode=5860 Temporary | rex field=Message "NotificationQuery =\s+(?<query>[^;|^$]+)"
  | search query!="SELECT * FROM Win32_ProcessStartTrace WHERE ProcessName = ''wsmprovhost.exe''"
  AND query!="SELECT * FROM __InstanceOperationEvent WHERE TargetInstance ISA ''AntiVirusProduct''
  OR TargetInstance ISA ''FirewallProduct'' OR TargetInstance ISA ''AntiSpywareProduct''"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName, query  |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wmi_temporary_event_subscription_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting the
  Windows WMI activity logs. This can be done by adding a stanza to inputs.conf on
  the system generating logs with a title of [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational].
known_false_positives: Some software may create WMI temporary event subscriptions
  for various purposes. The included search contains an exception for two of these
  that occur by default on Windows 10 systems. You may need to modify the search to
  create exceptions for other legitimate events.
