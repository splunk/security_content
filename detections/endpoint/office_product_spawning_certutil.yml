description: The following analytic detects any Windows Office Product spawning `certutil.exe`,
  a behavior often associated with malware families like TA551 and IcedID. This detection
  leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process relationships
  and command-line executions. The significance lies in the fact that `certutil.exe`
  is frequently used for downloading malicious payloads from remote URLs. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration,
  or further system compromise. Immediate investigation and containment are crucial
  to prevent potential damage.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.
