description: The following analytic detects suspicious modifications to cron jobs
  on Linux systems using the crontab command with list parameters. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and
  command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt
  to establish persistence or execute malicious code on a schedule. If confirmed malicious,
  the impact could include unauthorized code execution, data destruction, or other
  damaging outcomes. Further investigation should analyze the added cron job, its
  associated command, and any related processes.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "crontab"
  Processes.process= "* -l*" by  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.dest
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_adding_crontab_using_list_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
