description: The following analytic detects the use of `esentutl.exe` to access credentials
  stored in the ntds.dit or SAM file. This detection leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include
  command-line details. This activity is significant because it may indicate an attempt
  to extract sensitive credential information, which is a common tactic in lateral
  movement and privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to gain unauthorized access to user credentials, potentially compromising the entire
  network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_esentutl` Processes.process
  IN ("*ntds*", "*SAM*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `esentutl_sam_copy_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited. Filter as needed.
