description: The following analytic identifies the use of Plink being utilized to
  proxy egress or laterally in an organization. The analytic is limited to specific
  Plink options on the command-line, including -R -L and -D which will have the remote
  and local IP address or port and -l for a username. Modify the options as seen fit
  for your organization.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=plink.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=Plink Processes.process IN ("*-R *", "*-L *", "*-D
  *", "*-l *") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `windows_protocol_tunneling_with_plink_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization allows for
  SSH tunneling outbound or internally. Filter as needed.
