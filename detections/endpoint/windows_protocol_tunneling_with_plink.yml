description: This analytic detects the use of Plink (including renamed versions like pvhost.exe) for protocol tunneling, which may be used for egress or lateral movement within an organization. It identifies specific command-line options (-R, -L, -D, -l, -N, -P, -pw) commonly used for port forwarding and tunneling by analyzing process execution logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to bypass network security controls or establish unauthorized connections. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to exfiltrate data, move laterally across the network, or maintain persistent access, posing a severe threat to the organization's security. The detection covers both the original Plink executable and potential renamed versions, enhancing its ability to catch evasion attempts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization allows for SSH tunneling outbound or internally. Filter as needed.
