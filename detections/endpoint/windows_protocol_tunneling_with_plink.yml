description: The following analytic identifies the use of Plink being utilized to
  proxy egress or laterally in an organization. The analytic is limited to specific
  Plink options on the command-line, including -R -L and -D which will have the remote
  and local IP address or port and -l for a username. Modify the options as seen fit
  for your organization.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization allows for
  SSH tunneling outbound or internally. Filter as needed.
