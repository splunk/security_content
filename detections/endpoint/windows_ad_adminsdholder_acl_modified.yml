description: The following analytic identifies the modification of the Access Control List for the AdminSDHolder object within a Windows domain. Specifically, the 
  detection triggers on the addition of a new rule to the existing ACL. AdminSDHolder is an object located in the System Partition in Active Directory and is used as a 
  security template for objects that are members of certain privileged groups. Objects in these groups are enumerated and any objects with security descriptors that dont 
  match the AdminSDHolder ACL are flagged for updating. The Security Descriptor propagator (SDProp) process runs every 60 minutes on the PDC Emulator and re-stamps the object
  Access Control List (ACL) with the security permissions set on the AdminSDHolder. An adversary who has obtained privileged access to a Windows Domain may modify the AdminSDHolder
  ACL to establish persistence and allow an unprivileged user to take control of a domain.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting eventcode 
 `5136`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes` 
 within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. Additionally, a SACL needs to be created for the AdminSDHolder object in order to log modifications.
known_false_positives: Adding new users or groups to the AdminSDHolder ACL is not usual. Filter as needed
