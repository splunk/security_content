description: This search looks for wmic.exe being launched with parameters to spawn
  a process on a remote system.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.

known_false_positives: The wmic.exe utility is a benign Windows application. It may
  be used legitimately by Administrators with these parameters for remote system administration,
  but it's relatively uncommon.
