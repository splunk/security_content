description: The following analytic will identify a Windows Office Product spawning WScript.exe or CScript.exe. Tuning may be required based on legitimate application usage that may spawn scripts from an Office product.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("winword.exe","excel.exe","powerpnt.exe","mspub.exe","visio.exe") Processes.process_name IN ("wscript.exe", "cscript.exe")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `office_product_spawning_windows_script_host_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on macro based approved documents in the organization. Filtering may be needed.
