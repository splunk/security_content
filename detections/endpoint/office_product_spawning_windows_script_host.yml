description: The following analytic detects an Office product spawning WScript.exe
  or CScript.exe. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process creation events where Office applications are the parent processes.
  This activity is significant because it may indicate the execution of potentially
  malicious scripts through Office products, a common tactic in phishing attacks and
  malware delivery. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized
  code execution, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on macro based approved
  documents in the organization. Filtering may be needed.
