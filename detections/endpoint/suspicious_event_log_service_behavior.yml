description: The following analytic utilizes Windows Event ID 1100 to identify when
  Windows event log service is shutdown. Note that this is a voluminous analytic that
  will require tuning or restricted to specific endpoints based on criticality. This
  event generates every time Windows Event Log service has shut down. It also generates
  during normal system shutdown. During triage, based on time of day and user, determine
  if this was planned. If not planned, follow through with reviewing parallel alerts
  and other data sources to determine what else may have occurred.
search: (`wineventlog_security` EventCode=1100) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest Message EventCode | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_event_log_service_behavior_filter`
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows event logs from your hosts. In addition, the Splunk Windows TA is needed.
known_false_positives: It is possible the Event Logging service gets shut down due
  to system errors or legitimately administration tasks. Filter as needed.
