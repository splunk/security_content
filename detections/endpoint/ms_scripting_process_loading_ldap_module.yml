type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the execution of MS scripting processes (wscript.exe or cscript.exe) loading LDAP-related modules (Wldap32.dll, adsldp.dll, adsldpc.dll). It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify these specific DLL loads. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to query LDAP for host information, a behavior observed in FIN7 implants. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to gather detailed Active Directory information, potentially leading to further exploitation or data exfiltration.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode =7 Image IN ("*\\wscript.exe", "*\\cscript.exe") ImageLoaded IN ("*\\Wldap32.dll", "*\\adsldp.dll", "*\\adsldpc.dll") | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Image EventCode process_name ProcessId ProcessGuid Computer ImageLoaded | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `ms_scripting_process_loading_ldap_module_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: automation scripting language may used by network operator to do ldap query.
