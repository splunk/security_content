description: The following detection identifies the latest behavior utilized by different
  malware families (including TA551, AsyncRat, Redline and DCRAT). This detection identifies onenote
  Office Product spawning `mshta.exe`. In malicious instances, the command-line of
  `mshta.exe` will contain the `hta` file locally, or a URL to the remote destination.
  In addition, Threat Research has released a detections identifying suspicious use
  of `mshta.exe`. In this instance, we narrow our detection down to the Office suite
  as a parent process. During triage, review all file modifications. Capture and analyze
  any artifacts on disk. The Office Product, or `mshta.exe` will have reached out
  to a remote destination, capture and block the IPs or domain. Review additional
  parallel processes for further activity.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.
