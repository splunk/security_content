description: The following analytic detects OneNote spawning `mshta.exe`, a behavior
  often associated with spearphishing attacks. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where OneNote is
  the parent process. This activity is significant as it is commonly used by malware
  families like TA551, AsyncRat, Redline, and DCRAT to execute malicious scripts.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially
  leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or further malware deployment.
  Immediate investigation and containment are recommended.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("onenote.exe", "onenotem.exe") `process_mshta` by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_spearphishing_attachment_onenote_spawn_mshta_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.
