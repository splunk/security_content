description: The following detection identifies the latest behavior utilized by different
  malware families (including TA551, AsyncRat, Redline and DCRAT). This detection
  identifies onenote Office Product spawning `mshta.exe`. In malicious instances,
  the command-line of `mshta.exe` will contain the `hta` file locally, or a URL to
  the remote destination. In addition, Threat Research has released a detections identifying
  suspicious use of `mshta.exe`. In this instance, we narrow our detection down to
  the Office suite as a parent process. During triage, review all file modifications.
  Capture and analyze any artifacts on disk. The Office Product, or `mshta.exe` will
  have reached out to a remote destination, capture and block the IPs or domain. Review
  additional parallel processes for further activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.
