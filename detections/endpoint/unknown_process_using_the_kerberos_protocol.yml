description: The following analytic identifies a non-lsass.exe process making an outbound
  connection on port 88, which is typically used by the Kerberos authentication protocol.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process and network traffic logs. This activity is significant because,
  under normal circumstances, only the lsass.exe process should interact with the
  Kerberos Distribution Center. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate
  an adversary attempting to abuse the Kerberos protocol, potentially leading to unauthorized
  access or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1 AND Sysmon EventID 3
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name!=lsass.exe by _time Processes.process_id Processes.process_name
  Processes.dest Processes.process_path Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | join  process_id dest [| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Custom applications may leverage the Kerberos protocol. Filter
  as needed.
