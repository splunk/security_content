description: This analytic looks for restarted or re-enable services in linux platform.
  This technique can be executed or performed using systemctl or service tool application.
  Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious
  payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications
  called services that perform background system functions. Administrator may also
  create a legitimated service for a specific tool or normal application as part of
  task or automation, in this scenario it is suggested to look for the service path
  of the actual script or executable that register as service and who created the
  service for further verification.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name IN ("systemctl",
  "service") OR Processes.process IN ("*systemctl *", "*service *")) Processes.process
  IN ("*restart*", "*reload*", "*reenable*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_service_restarted_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and commandline executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this commandline
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
