description: 'The following analytic detects the restarting or re-enabling of services
  on Linux systems using the `systemctl` or `service` commands. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and command-line
  execution logs. This activity is significant as adversaries may use it to maintain
  persistence or execute unauthorized actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could lead to repeated execution of malicious payloads, unauthorized access, or
  data destruction. Security analysts should investigate these events to mitigate
  risks and prevent further compromise.'
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name IN ("systemctl",
  "service") OR Processes.process IN ("*systemctl *", "*service *")) Processes.process
  IN ("*restart*", "*reload*", "*reenable*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_service_restarted_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this commandline
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
