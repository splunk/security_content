description: The following analytic leverages Windows Security Event 4738, `A user
  account was changed`, to identify a change performed on a domain user object that
  disables Kerberos Pre-Authentication. Disabling the Pre Authentication flag in the
  UserAccountControl property allows an adversary to easily perform a brute force
  attack against the user's password offline leveraging the ASP REP Roasting technique.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike who have obtained privileges in an Active Directory
  network may use this technique as a backdoor or a way to escalate privileges.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4738 MSADChangedAttributes="*Don''t Require
  Preauth'' - Enabled*" | table EventCode, Account_Name, Security_ID, MSADChangedAttributes
  | `kerberos_pre_authentication_flag_disabled_in_useraccountcontrol_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `User Account
  Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
