description: The following analytic detects when the Kerberos Pre-Authentication flag is disabled in a user account, using Windows Security Event 4738. This event indicates a change in the UserAccountControl property of a domain user object. Disabling this flag allows adversaries to perform offline brute force attacks on the user's password using the AS-REP Roasting technique. This activity is significant as it can be used by attackers with existing privileges to escalate their access or maintain persistence. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of sensitive information.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Domain Controller events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `User Account Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
