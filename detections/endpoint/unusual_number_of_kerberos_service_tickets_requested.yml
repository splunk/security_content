description: 'The following hunting analytic leverages Kerberos Event 4769, A Kerberos
  service ticket was requested, to identify a potential kerberoasting attack against
  Active Directory networks. Kerberoasting allows an adversary to request kerberos
  tickets for domain accounts typically used as service accounts and attempt to crack
  them offline allowing them to obtain privileged access to the domain.

  The detection calculates the standard deviation for each host and leverages the
  3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number service ticket requests.
  To customize this analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket`
  span time and the calculation of the `upperBound` field.'
data_source:
- Windows Security 4769
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4769 ServiceName!="*$" TicketEncryptionType=0x17 | bucket span=2m _time | stats dc(ServiceName) AS unique_services values(ServiceName)
  as requested_services by _time, src | eventstats avg(unique_services)
  as comp_avg , stdev(unique_services) as comp_std by src | eval upperBound=(comp_avg+comp_std*3)
  | eval isOutlier=if(unique_services > 2 and unique_services >= upperBound, 1, 0)
  | search isOutlier=1 | `unusual_number_of_kerberos_service_tickets_requested_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: An single endpoint requesting a large number of kerberos service
  tickets is not common behavior. Possible false positive scenarios include but are
  not limited to vulnerability scanners, administration systems and missconfigured
  systems.
