description: 'The following analytic identifies an unusual number of Kerberos service
  ticket requests, potentially indicating a kerberoasting attack. It leverages Kerberos
  Event 4769 and calculates the standard deviation for each host, using the 3-sigma
  rule to detect anomalies. This activity is significant as kerberoasting allows adversaries
  to request service tickets and crack them offline, potentially gaining privileged
  access to the domain. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access
  to sensitive accounts and escalation of privileges within the Active Directory environment.'
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4769
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4769 ServiceName!="*$" TicketEncryptionType=0x17
  | bucket span=2m _time | stats dc(ServiceName) AS unique_services values(ServiceName)
  as requested_services by _time, src | eventstats avg(unique_services) as comp_avg
  , stdev(unique_services) as comp_std by src | eval upperBound=(comp_avg+comp_std*3)
  | eval isOutlier=if(unique_services > 2 and unique_services >= upperBound, 1, 0)
  | search isOutlier=1 | `unusual_number_of_kerberos_service_tickets_requested_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: An single endpoint requesting a large number of kerberos service
  tickets is not common behavior. Possible false positive scenarios include but are
  not limited to vulnerability scanners, administration systems and missconfigured
  systems.
