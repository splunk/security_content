status: experimental
type: Anomaly
description: This analytic looks for suspicious commandline that redirect the stdout
  or possible stderror to dev/null file. This technique was seen in cyclopsblink malware
  where it redirect the possible output or error while modify the iptables firewall
  setting of the compromised machine to hide its action from the user. This Anomaly
  detection is a good pivot to look further why process or user use this un common
  approach.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process = "*&amp;&gt;/dev/null*"
  by  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
