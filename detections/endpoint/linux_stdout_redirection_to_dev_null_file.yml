description: The following analytic detects command-line activities that redirect
  stdout or stderr to the /dev/null file. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. This behavior is
  significant as it can indicate attempts to hide command outputs, a technique observed
  in the CyclopsBlink malware to conceal modifications to iptables firewall settings.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to stealthily alter
  system configurations, potentially leading to unauthorized access or persistent
  control over the compromised machine.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process = "*&amp;&gt;/dev/null*"
  by  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_stdout_redirection_to_dev_null_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
