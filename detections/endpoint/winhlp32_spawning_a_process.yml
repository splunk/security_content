description: The following analytic detects winhlp32.exe spawning a child process that loads a file from appdata, programdata, or temp directories. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events. This activity is significant because winhlp32.exe has known vulnerabilities and can be exploited to execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use this technique to execute arbitrary scripts, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment. Analysts should review parallel processes, module loads, and file modifications for further suspicious behavior.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as winhlp32.exe is typically not used with the latest flavors of Windows OS. However, filter as needed.
