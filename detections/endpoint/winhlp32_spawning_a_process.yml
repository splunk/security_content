description: The following analytic identifies winhlp32.exe, found natively in `c:\windows\`,
  spawning a child process that loads a file out of appdata, programdata, or temp.
  Winhlp32.exe has a rocky past in that multiple vulnerabilities were found and added
  to MetaSploit. WinHlp32.exe is required to display 32-bit Help files that have the
  ".hlp" file name extension. This particular instance is related to a Remcos sample
  where dynwrapx.dll is added to the registry under inprocserver32, and later module
  loaded by winhlp32.exe to spawn wscript.exe and load a vbs or file from disk. During
  triage, review parallel processes to identify further suspicious behavior. Review
  module loads for unsuspecting unsigned modules. Capture any file modifications and
  analyze.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=winhlp32.exe
  Processes.process IN ("*\\appdata\\*","*\\programdata\\*", "*\\temp\\*") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `winhlp32_spawning_a_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as winhlp32.exe is typically
  not used with the latest flavors of Windows OS. However, filter as needed.
