description: The following analytic detects winhlp32.exe spawning a child process
  that loads a file from appdata, programdata, or temp directories. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  creation events. This activity is significant because winhlp32.exe has known vulnerabilities
  and can be exploited to execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could use this technique to execute arbitrary scripts, escalate privileges, or maintain
  persistence within the environment. Analysts should review parallel processes, module
  loads, and file modifications for further suspicious behavior.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=winhlp32.exe

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as winhlp32.exe is typically
  not used with the latest flavors of Windows OS. However, filter as needed.
