description: Detect multiple executions of Living off the Land (LOLbin) binaries in
  a short period of time.
data_source: []
search: '`osquery` name=es_process_events columns.cmdline IN ("find*", "crontab*",
  "screencapture*", "openssl*", "curl*", "wget*", "killall*", "funzip*") | rename
  columns.* as * | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(cmdline)
  as cmdline, values(pid) as pid, values(parent) as parent, values(path) as path,
  values(signing_id) as signing_id,  dc(path) as dc_path by username host | rename
  username as User, cmdline as process, path as process_path | where dc_path > 3 |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `macos_lolbin_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection uses osquery and endpoint security on MacOS. Follow
  the link in references, which describes how to setup process auditing in MacOS with
  endpoint security and osquery.
