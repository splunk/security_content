description: The following analytic detects multiple executions of Living off the
  Land (LOLbin) binaries on macOS within a short period. It leverages osquery to monitor
  process events and identifies commands such as "find", "crontab", "screencapture",
  "openssl", "curl", "wget", "killall", and "funzip". This activity is significant
  as LOLbins are often used by attackers to perform malicious actions while evading
  detection. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute
  arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment, posing a
  significant security risk.

how_to_implement: This detection uses osquery and endpoint security on MacOS. Follow
  the link in references, which describes how to setup process auditing in MacOS with
  endpoint security and osquery.
