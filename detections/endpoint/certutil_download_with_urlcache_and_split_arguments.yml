description: Certutil.exe may download a file from a remote destination using `-urlcache`.
  This behavior does require a URL to be passed on the command-line. In addition,
  `-f` (force) and `-split` (Split embedded ASN.1 elements, and save to files) will
  be used. It is not entirely common for `certutil.exe` to contact public IP space.
  However, it is uncommon for `certutil.exe` to write files to world writeable paths.\
  During triage, capture any files on disk and review. Review the reputation of the
  remote IP or domain in question.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=certutil.exe
  Processes.process=*urlcache* Processes.process=*split* by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `certutil_download_with_urlcache_and_split_arguments_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed based on parent-child relationship or network connection.
