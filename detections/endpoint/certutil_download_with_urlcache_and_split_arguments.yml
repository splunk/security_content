description: Certutil.exe may download a file from a remote destination using `-urlcache`.
  This behavior does require a URL to be passed on the command-line. In addition,
  `-f` (force) and `-split` (Split embedded ASN.1 elements, and save to files) will
  be used. It is not entirely common for `certutil.exe` to contact public IP space.
  However, it is uncommon for `certutil.exe` to write files to world writeable paths.
  During triage, capture any files on disk and review. Review the reputation of the
  remote IP or domain in question.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed based on parent-child relationship or network connection.
