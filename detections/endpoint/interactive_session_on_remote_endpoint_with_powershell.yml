description: The following analytic detects the use of the `Enter-PSSession` cmdlet
  to establish an interactive session on a remote endpoint via the WinRM protocol.
  It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this activity
  by searching for specific script block text patterns. This behavior is significant
  as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code execution attempts by adversaries.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute commands
  remotely, potentially leading to further compromise of the network and unauthorized
  access to sensitive information.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText="*Enter-PSSession*" AND ScriptBlockText="*-ComputerName*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest | rename UserID as user| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `interactive_session_on_remote_endpoint_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup instructions
  can be found 
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WinRM and `Enter-PSSession` for
  administrative and troubleshooting tasks. This activity is usually limited to a
  small set of hosts or users. In certain environments, tuning may not be possible.
