description: The following analytic identifies successful remote desktop connections. Utilize this analytic to hunt for successful attempts. In addition, the query may be modified for EventCode=1148 to potentially identify failed attempts. In testing, 1148 would not generate based on a failed logon attempt.
  Note this analytic requires enabling and a stanza in a inputs.conf.
search: '`remoteconnectionmanager` EventCode=1149
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName, Source_Network_Address, User, Message
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | rename ComputerName as dest | `windows_rdp_connection_successful_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analyic requires the WIndows TerminalServices RemoteConnectionManager Operational log to be enabled and ingested into Splunk. For the inputs, review https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/138c6bf563bacbda4a2524f089773706. 
known_false_positives: False positives will be present, filter as needed or restrict to critical assets on the perimeter.
