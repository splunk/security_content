description: The following analytic identifies native .net binaries within the Windows
  operating system that may be abused by adversaries by moving it to a new directory.
  The analytic identifies the .net binary by using a lookup and compares the process
  name and original file name (internal name). The analytic utilizes a lookup with
  the is_net_windows_file_macro macro to identify the binary process name and original file
  name. if one or the other matches an alert will be generated. Adversaries abuse
  these binaries as they are native to windows and native DotNet. Note that not all
  SDK (post install of Windows) are captured in the lookup.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may be required.
  Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application
  in use.
