description: The following analytic detects the execution of native .NET binaries
  from non-standard directories within the Windows operating system. It leverages
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, comparing process names and original
  file names against a predefined lookup using the `is_net_windows_file_macro` macro.
  This activity is significant because adversaries may move .NET binaries to unconventional
  paths to evade detection and execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, this
  behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or
  maintain persistence within the environment, posing a significant security risk.

  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where NOT (Processes.process_path
  IN ("*\\Windows\\ADWS\\*","*\\Windows\\SysWOW64*", "*\\Windows\\system32*", "*\\Windows\\NetworkController\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\SystemApps\\*", "*\\WinSxS\\*", "*\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\*")) by

  | `windows_dotnet_binary_in_non_standard_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may be required.
  Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application
  in use.
