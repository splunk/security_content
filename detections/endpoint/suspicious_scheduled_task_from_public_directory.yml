description: 'The following analytic, "Suspicious Scheduled Task from Public Directory",
  detects the registration of scheduled tasks aimed to execute a binary or script
  from public directories, a behavior often associated with malware deployment. It
  utilizes the Sysmon Event ID 1 data source, searching for instances where schtasks.exe
  is connected with the directories users\public, \programdata\, or \windows\temp
  and involves the /create command.\

  The registration of such scheduled tasks in public directories could suggest that
  an attacker is trying to maintain persistence or execute malicious scripts. If confirmed
  as a true positive, this could lead to data compromise, unauthorized access, and
  potential lateral movement within the network.'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*\\users\\public\\* OR Processes.process=*\\programdata\\* OR
  Processes.process=*windows\\temp*)  Processes.process=*/create* by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `suspicious_scheduled_task_from_public_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: The main source of false positives could be the legitimate
  use of scheduled tasks from these directories. Careful tuning of this search may
  be necessary to suit the specifics of your environment, reducing the rate of false
  positives.
