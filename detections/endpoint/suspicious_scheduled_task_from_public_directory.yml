description: The following analytic, "Suspicious Scheduled Task from Public Directory", detects the registration of scheduled tasks aimed to execute a binary or script from public directories, a behavior often associated with malware deployment. It utilizes the Sysmon Event ID 1 data source, searching for instances where schtasks.exe is connected with the directories users\public, \programdata\, or \windows\temp and involves the /create command.\

  The registration of such scheduled tasks in public directories could suggest that an attacker is trying to maintain persistence or execute malicious scripts. If confirmed as a true positive, this could lead to data compromise, unauthorized access, and potential lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*\\users\\public\\* OR Processes.process=*\\programdata\\* OR
  Processes.process=*windows\\temp*)  Processes.process=*/create* by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `suspicious_scheduled_task_from_public_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: The main source of false positives could be the legitimate use of scheduled tasks from these directories. Careful tuning of this search may be necessary to suit the specifics of your environment, reducing the rate of false positives.
