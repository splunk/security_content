description: 'The following analytic identifies the creation of scheduled tasks that
  execute binaries or scripts from public directories, such as users\public, \programdata\,
  or \windows\temp, using schtasks.exe with the /create command. It leverages Sysmon
  Event ID 1 data to detect this behavior. This activity is significant because it
  often indicates an attempt to maintain persistence or execute malicious scripts,
  which are common tactics in malware deployment. If confirmed as malicious, this
  could lead to data compromise, unauthorized access, and potential lateral movement
  within the network.'
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*\\users\\public\\* OR Processes.process=*\\programdata\\* OR
  Processes.process=*windows\\temp*)  Processes.process=*/create* by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `suspicious_scheduled_task_from_public_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: The main source of false positives could be the legitimate
  use of scheduled tasks from these directories. Careful tuning of this search may
  be necessary to suit the specifics of your environment, reducing the rate of false
  positives.
