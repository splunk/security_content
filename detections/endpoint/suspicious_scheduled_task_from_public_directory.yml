author: Michael Haag, Splunk
type: batch
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following detection identifies Scheduled Tasks registering (creating
  a new task) a binary or script to run from a public directory which includes users\public,
  \programdata\ and \windows\temp. Upon triage, review the binary or script in the
  command line for legitimacy, whether an approved binary/script or not. In addition,
  capture the binary or script in question and analyze for further behaviors. Identify
  the source and contain the endpoint.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe
  (Processes.process=*\\users\\public\\* OR Processes.process=*\\programdata\\* OR
  Processes.process=*windows\\temp*)  Processes.process=*/create* by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `suspicious_scheduled_task_from_public_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present. Filter as needed by
  parent process or command line argument.
