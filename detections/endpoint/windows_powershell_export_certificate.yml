description: The following analytic detects the use of the PowerShell Cmdlet `export-certificate`
  by leveraging Script Block Logging. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  an adversary attempting to exfiltrate certificates from the local Certificate Store
  on a Windows endpoint. Monitoring this behavior is crucial because stolen certificates
  can be used to impersonate users, decrypt sensitive data, or facilitate further
  attacks. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access
  to encrypted communications and sensitive information, posing a severe security
  risk.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN ("*export-certificate*") |
  rename Computer as dest  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by EventCode ScriptBlockText dest user_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_powershell_export_certificate_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: It is possible administrators or scripts may run these commands,
  filtering may be required.
