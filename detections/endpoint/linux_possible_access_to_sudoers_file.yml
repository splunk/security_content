type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to detect a possible access or modification of /etc/sudoers
  file. "/etc/sudoers" file controls who can run what command as what users on what
  machine and can also control whether a specific user need a password for particular
  commands.  adversaries and threat actors abuse this file to gain persistence and/or
  privilege escalation during attack on targeted host.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN("cat",
  "nano*","vim*", "vi*")  AND Processes.process IN("*/etc/sudoers*") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_possible_access_to_sudoers_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
