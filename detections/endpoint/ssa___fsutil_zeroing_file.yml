description: This search is to detect a suspicious fsutil process to zeroing a target
  file. This technique was seen in lockbit ransomware where it tries to zero out its
  malware path as part of its defense evasion after encrypting the compromised host.
search: '| from read_ssa_enriched_events() | eval timestamp=parse_long(ucast(map_get(input_event,
  "_time"), "string", null)), cmd_line=lower(ucast(map_get(input_event, "process"),
  "string", null)), process_name=lower(ucast(map_get(input_event, "process_name"),
  "string", null)), process_path=ucast(map_get(input_event, "process_path"), "string",
  null), parent_process_name=ucast(map_get(input_event, "parent_process_name"), "string",
  null), event_id=ucast(map_get(input_event, "event_id"), "string", null) | where
  cmd_line IS NOT NULL AND process_name IS NOT NULL AND process_name="fsutil.exe"
  AND (like (cmd_line, "%setzerodata%")) | eval start_time=timestamp, end_time=timestamp,
  entities=mvappend(ucast(map_get(input_event, "dest_user_id"), "string", null), ucast(map_get(input_event,
  "dest_device_id"), "string", null)), body=create_map(["event_id", event_id, "cmd_line",
  cmd_line, "process_name", process_name, "parent_process_name", parent_process_name,
  "process_path", process_path]) | into write_ssa_detected_events();'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: System administrators or scripts may delete user accounts via
  this technique. Filter as needed.
