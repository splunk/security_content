type: Anomaly
description: This analytic looks for inserting of linux kernel module using insmod
  utility function. This event can detect a installation of rootkit or malicious kernel
  module to gain elevated privileges to their malicious code and bypassed detections.
  This Anomaly detection is a good indicator that someone installing kernel module
  in a linux host either admin or adversaries. filter is needed in this scenario
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN("kmod",
  "sudo") AND Processes.process = *insmod* by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_insert_kernel_module_using_insmod_utility_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
