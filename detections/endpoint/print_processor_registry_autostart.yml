description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious modification or new registry
  entry regarding print processor. This registry is known to be abuse by turla or
  other APT to gain persistence and privilege escalation to the compromised machine.
  This is done by adding the malicious dll payload on the new created key in this
  registry that will be executed as it restarted the spoolsv.exe process and services.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path
  ="*\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\Windows x64\\Print Processors*" by Registry.dest  Registry.user
  Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)`
  | `print_processor_registry_autostart_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: possible new printer installation may add driver component
  on this registry.
