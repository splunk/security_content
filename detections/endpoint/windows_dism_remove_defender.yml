description: The following analytic identifies the use of the Windows Disk Image Utility,
  `dism.exe`, to remove Windows Defender. Adversaries may use `dism.exe` to disable
  Defender before completing their objective.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=dism.exe
  (Processes.process="*/online*" AND Processes.process="*/disable-feature*" AND Processes.process="*Windows-Defender*"
  AND Processes.process="*/remove*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_dism_remove_defender_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate administrative tools leverage `dism.exe` to
  manipulate packages and features of the operating system. Filter as needed.
