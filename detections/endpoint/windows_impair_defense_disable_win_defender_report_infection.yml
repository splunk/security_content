description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that disable Windows Defender's infection reporting. It leverages data from the
  Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to the "DontReportInfectionInformation"
  registry key. This activity is significant because it can prevent Windows Defender
  from reporting detailed threat information to Microsoft, potentially allowing malware
  to evade detection. If confirmed malicious, this action could enable attackers to
  bypass security measures, maintain persistence, and avoid detection, leading to
  prolonged unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Microsoft\\MRT\\DontReportInfectionInformation"
  Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001" by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user

  | `windows_impair_defense_disable_win_defender_report_infection_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
