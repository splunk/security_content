description: Credential extraction is often an illegal recovery of credential material
  from secured authentication resources and repositories. This process may also involve
  decryption or other transformations of the stored credential material. PowerSploit
  and DSInternals are common exploit APIs offering PowerShell modules for various
  exploits of Windows and Active Directory environments.
eli5: This detection identifies triggering of the PowerSploit or DSInternals for extraction
  of all accounts from a previously dumped ntds.dit credential store.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Windows Security logs from devices of interest,
  including the event ID 4688 with enabled command line logging.
