description: The following analytic detects a process loading the credui.dll or wincredui.dll module. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify instances where these DLLs are loaded by processes outside typical system directories. This activity is significant because adversaries often abuse these modules to create fake credential prompts or dump credentials, posing a risk of credential theft. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to harvest user credentials, leading to unauthorized access and potential lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  (ImageLoaded = "*\\credui.dll" AND OriginalFileName = "credui.dll") OR (ImageLoaded = "*\\wincredui.dll" AND OriginalFileName = "wincredui.dll") AND NOT(Image IN("*\\windows\\explorer.exe", "*\\windows\\system32\\*", "*\\windows\\sysWow64\\*", "*:\\program files*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded OriginalFileName dest EventCode Signed ProcessId ProcessGuid | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_input_capture_using_credential_ui_dll_filter`'
how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709 will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
known_false_positives: this module can be loaded by a third party application. Filter is needed.
