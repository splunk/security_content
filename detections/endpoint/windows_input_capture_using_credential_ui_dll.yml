description: The following analytic detects a process loading the credui.dll or wincredui.dll
  module. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify instances where
  these DLLs are loaded by processes outside typical system directories. This activity
  is significant because adversaries often abuse these modules to create fake credential
  prompts or dump credentials, posing a risk of credential theft. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow attackers to harvest user credentials, leading to unauthorized
  access and potential lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  (ImageLoaded = "*\\credui.dll" AND OriginalFileName
  = "credui.dll") OR (ImageLoaded = "*\\wincredui.dll" AND OriginalFileName = "wincredui.dll")
  AND NOT(Image IN("*\\windows\\explorer.exe", "*\\windows\\system32\\*", "*\\windows\\sysWow64\\*",
  "*:\\program files*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by Image ImageLoaded OriginalFileName dest EventCode Signed ProcessId ProcessGuid
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_input_capture_using_credential_ui_dll_filter`'
how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
  will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to
  work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
known_false_positives: this module can be loaded by a third party application. Filter
  is needed.
