- Endpoint
description:  The following analytic identifies a unix shell command that can wipe root folders of a linux host. 
  This commandline is being abused by Awfulshred malware that wipes or corrupts files in a targeted Linux host. The shell command uses the 
  rm command with force recursive deletion even in the root folder. This TTP can be a good indicator that a user or a process wants to wipe roots directory 
  files in Linux host.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name = "rm"  AND Processes.process IN ("* -rf*", "* -fr*") AND Processes.process = "* --no-preserve-root" 
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id 
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `linux_data_destruction_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
