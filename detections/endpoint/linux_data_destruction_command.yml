type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies a unix shell command that can wipe
  root folders of a linux host. This commandline is being abused by Awfulshred malware
  that wipes or corrupts files in a targeted Linux host. The shell command uses the
  rm command with force recursive deletion even in the root folder. This TTP can be
  a good indicator that a user or a process wants to wipe roots directory files in
  Linux host.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "rm"  AND
  Processes.process IN ("* -rf*", "* -fr*") AND Processes.process = "* --no-preserve-root"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
