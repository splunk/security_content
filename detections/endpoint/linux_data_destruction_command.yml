description: The following analytic detects the execution of a Unix shell command
  designed to wipe root directories on a Linux host. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on the 'rm' command with force recursive
  deletion and the '--no-preserve-root' option. This activity is significant as it
  indicates potential data destruction attempts, often associated with malware like
  Awfulshred. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to severe data loss,
  system instability, and compromised integrity of the affected Linux host. Immediate
  investigation and response are crucial to mitigate potential damage.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "rm"  AND
  Processes.process IN ("* -rf*", "* -fr*") AND Processes.process = "* --no-preserve-root"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_data_destruction_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
