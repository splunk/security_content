- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-ForestDomain`
  cmdlet, a component of the PowerView toolkit used for Windows domain enumeration.
  It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this activity.
  Detecting `Get-ForestDomain` is significant because adversaries and Red Teams use
  it to gather detailed information about Active Directory forest and domain configurations.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable attackers to understand the domain
  structure, facilitating lateral movement or privilege escalation within the environment.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*Get-ForestDomain*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest, UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_forest_discovery_with_getforestdomain_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerSploit tools for legitimate
  reasons, filter as needed.
