description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious wscript commandline to execute
  vbscript. This technique was seen in several malware to execute malicious vbs file
  using wscript application. commonly vbs script is associated to cscript process
  and this can be a technique to evade process parent child detections or even some
  av script emulation system.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "wscript.exe" AND Processes.parent_process = "*//e:vbscript*") OR (Processes.process_name
  = "wscript.exe" AND Processes.process = "*//e:vbscript*") by Processes.parent_process_name

  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `vbscript_execution_using_wscript_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
