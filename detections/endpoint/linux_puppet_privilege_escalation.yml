description: The following analytic detects the execution of Puppet commands with
  elevated privileges, specifically when Puppet is used to apply configurations with
  sudo rights. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details.
  This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation
  attempt, where a user could gain root access and execute system commands as the
  root user. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to fully compromise
  the system, execute arbitrary commands, and maintain persistent control.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*puppet*"
  AND Processes.process="*apply*" AND Processes.process="*-e*" AND Processes.process="*exec*"
  AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_puppet_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
