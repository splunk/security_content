description: The following analytic detects the execution of an arbitrary DLL by the
  Windows Remote Auto Dialer (rasautou.exe). This behavior is identified by analyzing
  process creation events where rasautou.exe is executed with specific command-line
  arguments. This activity is significant because it leverages a Living Off The Land
  Binary (LOLBin) to execute potentially malicious code, bypassing traditional security
  controls. If confirmed malicious, this technique could allow an attacker to execute
  arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise, privilege escalation,
  or persistent access within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=rasautou.exe
  Processes.process="* -d *"AND Processes.process="* -p *" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_rasautou_dll_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to applications that require
  Rasautou.exe to load a DLL from disk. Filter as needed.
