description: The following analytic detects the creation of a service with the default
  name "KrbSCM" associated with the KrbRelayUp tool. It leverages Windows System Event
  Logs, specifically EventCode 7045, to identify this activity. This behavior is significant
  as KrbRelayUp is a known tool used for privilege escalation attacks. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to escalate privileges, potentially
  gaining unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log System 7045
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ServiceName IN ("KrbSCM") | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest EventCode ImagePath ServiceName
  StartType ServiceType | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_krbrelayup_service_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows System Event Logs with 7045 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also required.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is specific to KrbRelayUp
  based attack. Filter as needed.
