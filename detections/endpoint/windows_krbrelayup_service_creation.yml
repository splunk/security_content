status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies the default service name created by
  KrbRelayUp. Defenders should be aware that attackers could change the hardcoded
  service name of the KrbRelayUp tool and bypass this detection.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 Service_Name IN ("KrbSCM") | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Service_File_Name Service_Name
  Service_Start_Type Service_Type | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_krbrelayup_service_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows System Event Logs with 7045 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also required.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is specific to KrbRelayUp
  based attack. Filter as needed.
