description: This search looks for processes launched from files that have double
  extensions in the file name. This is typically done to obscure the "real" file extension
  and make it appear as though the file being accessed is a data file, as opposed
  to executable content.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node.
