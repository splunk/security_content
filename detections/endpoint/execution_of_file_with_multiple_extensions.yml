type: TTP
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search looks for processes launched from files that have double
  extensions in the file name. This is typically done to obscure the "real" file extension
  and make it appear as though the file being accessed is a data file, as opposed
  to executable content.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = *.doc.exe
  OR Processes.process = *.htm.exe OR Processes.process = *.html.exe OR Processes.process
  = *.txt.exe OR Processes.process = *.pdf.exe OR Processes.process = *.doc.exe by
  Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process Processes.parent_process | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `execution_of_file_with_multiple_extensions_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node.
known_false_positives: None identified.
