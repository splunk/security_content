description: This search looks for processes launched from files that have double
  extensions in the file name. This is typically done to obscure the "real" file extension
  and make it appear as though the file being accessed is a data file, as opposed
  to executable content.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN ("*.doc.exe",
  "*.xls.exe","*.ppt.exe", "*.htm.exe", "*.html.exe", "*.txt.exe", "*.pdf.exe", "*.docx.exe",
  "*.xlsx.exe", "*.pptx.exe","*.one.exe", "*.bat.exe", "*rtf.exe") by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.process Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `execution_of_file_with_multiple_extensions_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: None identified.
