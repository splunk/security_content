description: 'Fodhelper.exe has a known UAC bypass as it attempts to look for specific
  registry keys upon execution, that do not exist. Therefore, an attacker can write
  its malicious commands in these registry keys to be executed by fodhelper.exe with
  the highest privilege.

  * `HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`

  * `HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command\DelegateExecute`

  * `HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command\(default)`

  Upon triage, fodhelper.exe will have a child process and read access will occur
  on the registry keys. Isolate the endpoint and review parallel processes for additional
  behavior.'
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=fodhelper.exe
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `fodhelper_uac_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited to no false positives are expected.
