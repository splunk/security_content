description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS cmdkey.exe
  tool. This tool is being abused or used by several post exploitation tool such as
  winpeas that being used by ransomware prestige to list stored user names, passwords
  or credentials in the targeted Windows OS host. This information can be used by
  the attacker to gain privilege escalation and persistence in the targeted hosts
  for further attacks.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="cmdkey.exe"
  OR Processes.original_file_name = "cmdkey.exe" AND Processes.process = "*/list*"
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_credentials_from_password_stores_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.
