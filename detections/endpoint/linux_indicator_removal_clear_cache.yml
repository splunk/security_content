description: This analytic looks for processes that clear or free page cache in Linux system host. 
  This technique was seen in Awfulshred malware wiper that tries to clear the cache using kernel system request drop_caches 
  while wiping all files in the targeted host. This TTP detection can be a good indicator of user or process tries to clear page cache 
  to delete tracks or might be a wiper like Awfulshred.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name IN ("dash", "sudo", "bash")  AND Processes.process  IN("* echo 3 &gt; *", "* echo 2 &gt; *","* echo 1 &gt; *") AND Processes.process = "*/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id 
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `linux_indicator_removal_clear_cache_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
