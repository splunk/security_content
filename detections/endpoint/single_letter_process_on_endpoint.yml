description: This search looks for process names that consist only of a single letter.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes by Processes.dest, Processes.user,
  Processes.process, Processes.process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | eval process_name_length = len(process_name),
  endExe = if(substr(process_name, -4) == ".exe", 1, 0) | search process_name_length=5
  AND endExe=1 | table count, firstTime, lastTime, dest, user, process, process_name

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
known_false_positives: Single-letter executables are not always malicious. Investigate
  this activity with your normal incident-response process.
