name: Attempted Credential Dump From Registry via Reg exe

description: The following analytic detects the execution of reg.exe with parameters
  that export registry keys containing hashed credentials. It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
  involving reg.exe or cmd.exe with specific registry paths. This activity is significant
  because exporting these keys can allow attackers to obtain hashed credentials, which
  they may attempt to crack offline. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  access to sensitive accounts, enabling further compromise and lateral movement within
  the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
