description: As simple as it sounds, this analytic identifies when the native mimikatz.exe
  binary executes on Windows. It does look for the original file name as well, just
  in case the binary is renamed. Adversaries sometimes bring in the default binary
  and run it directly. Benjamin Delpy originally created Mimikatz as a proof of concept
  to show Microsoft that its authentication protocols were vulnerable to an attack.
  Instead, he inadvertently created one of the most widely used and downloaded threat
  actor tools of the past 20 years. Mimikatz is an open-source application that allows
  users to view and save authentication credentials such as Kerberos tickets.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name=mimikatz.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name=mimikatz.exe) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_mimikatz_binary_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is directly looking
  for Mimikatz, the credential dumping utility.
