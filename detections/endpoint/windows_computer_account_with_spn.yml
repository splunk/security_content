type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies two SPNs, HOST and RestrictedKrbHost,
  added using the KrbRelayUp behavior. This particular behavior has been found in
  other Kerberos based attacks.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4741
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4741 NewUacValue="0x80" ServicePrincipalNames IN ("*HOST/*","*RestrictedKrbHost/*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(EventCode),values(TargetDomainName),values(PrimaryGroupId),
  values(OldUacValue), values(NewUacValue),values(SamAccountName),values(DnsHostName),values(ServicePrincipalNames)
  by dest Logon_ID subject | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_computer_account_with_spn_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4741 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: It is possible third party applications may add these SPNs
  to Computer Accounts, filtering may be needed.
