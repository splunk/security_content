description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet
  with the `DS_User` class parameter via PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104).
  It leverages logs to identify attempts to query all domain users using WMI. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary or Red Team operation attempting
  to enumerate domain users for situational awareness and Active Directory discovery.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to further reconnaissance, enabling
  attackers to map out the network and identify potential targets for privilege escalation
  or lateral movement.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*get-wmiobject*" ScriptBlockText
  = "*ds_user*" ScriptBlockText = "*-namespace*" ScriptBlockText = "*root\\directory\\ldap*"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Opcode Computer

  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `getwmiobject_ds_user_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
