- Endpoint
description: this detection was designed to identifies suspicious spawned process
  of known MS office application due to macro or malicious code. this technique can
  be seen in so many malware like IcedID that used MS office as its weapon or attack
  vector to initially infect the machines.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "winword.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name = "excel.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name
  = "powerpnt.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name = "outlook.exe") `process_regsvr32`
  by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name

  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `office_application_spawn_regsvr32_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
