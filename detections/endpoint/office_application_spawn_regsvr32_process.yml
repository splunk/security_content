description: The following analytic identifies instances where an Office application
  spawns a Regsvr32 process, which is often indicative of macro execution or malicious
  code. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process creation events where the parent process is a known Office application.
  This activity is significant because it is a common technique used by malware, such
  as IcedID, to initiate infections. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead
  to code execution, allowing attackers to gain control over the affected system and
  potentially escalate privileges.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
