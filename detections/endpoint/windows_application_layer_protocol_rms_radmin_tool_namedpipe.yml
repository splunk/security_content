description: The following analytic detects the use of default or publicly known named pipes associated with the RMX remote admin tool. It leverages Sysmon EventCodes 17 and 18 to identify named pipe creation and connection events. This activity is significant as the RMX tool has been abused by adversaries and malware like Azorult to collect data from targeted hosts. If confirmed malicious, this could indicate unauthorized remote administration capabilities, leading to data exfiltration or further compromise of the affected system. Immediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of this tool's presence.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 17
- Sysmon EventID 18
search: '`sysmon` EventCode IN (17, 18) EventType IN ( "CreatePipe", "ConnectPipe") PipeName IN ("\\RManFUSServerNotify32", "\\RManFUSCallbackNotify32", "\\RMSPrint*") | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Image EventType ProcessId PipeName dest UserID | rename UserID as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_application_layer_protocol_rms_radmin_tool_namedpipe_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Filter based on pipe name or process.
