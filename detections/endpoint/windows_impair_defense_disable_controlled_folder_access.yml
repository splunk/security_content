description: The following analytic detects a modification in the Windows registry
  that disables the Windows Defender Controlled Folder Access feature. It leverages
  data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, specifically monitoring changes to the
  EnableControlledFolderAccess registry setting. This activity is significant because
  Controlled Folder Access is designed to protect critical folders from unauthorized
  access, including ransomware attacks. If this activity is confirmed malicious, it
  could allow attackers to bypass a key security feature, potentially leading to unauthorized
  access or modification of sensitive files.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\Windows Defender Exploit Guard\\Controlled Folder Access\\EnableControlledFolderAccess"

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
