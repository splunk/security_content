description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to disable Windows Defender 
  Controlled Folder Access feature. The EnableControlledFolderAccess registry setting is associated with the Controlled 
  Folder Access feature in Windows Defender. Controlled Folder Access is a security feature designed to protect certain 
  folders from unauthorized access or modification by malicious applications, including ransomware.
  When EnableControlledFolderAccess is set to 0, it usually indicates that the Controlled Folder Access feature 
  within Windows Defender is not active. Consequently, the protection mechanism for the specified folders against 
  unauthorized access by potentially malicious applications or ransomware is not enabled.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
