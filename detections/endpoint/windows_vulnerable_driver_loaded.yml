description: The following analytic detects the loading of known vulnerable Windows
  drivers, which may indicate potential persistence or privilege escalation attempts.
  It leverages Sysmon EventCode 6 to identify driver loading events and cross-references
  them with a list of vulnerable drivers. This activity is significant as attackers
  often exploit vulnerable drivers to gain elevated privileges or maintain persistence
  on a system. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code with high privileges, leading to further system compromise and potential data
  exfiltration.
data_source:
  - Sysmon EventID 6
search:
  "`sysmon` EventCode=6  | stats  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime count by dest ImageLoaded | lookup loldrivers driver_name AS ImageLoaded OUTPUT
  is_driver driver_description | search is_driver = TRUE | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_vulnerable_driver_loaded_filter`"
how_to_implement: Sysmon collects driver loads via EventID 6, however you may modify
  the query to utilize this lookup to identify potentially persistent drivers that
  are known to be vulnerable.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present. Drill down into the driver
  further by version number and cross reference by signer. Review the reference material
  in the lookup. In addition, modify the query to look within specific paths, which
  will remove a lot of "normal" drivers.
