description:
  The following analytic utilizes a known list of vulnerable Windows drivers
  to help defenders find potential persistence or privelege escalation via a vulnerable
  driver. This analytic uses Sysmon EventCode 6, driver loading. A known gap with
  this lookup is that it does not use the hash or known signer of the vulnerable driver
  therefore it is up to the defender to identify version and signing info and confirm
  it is a vulnerable driver.
data_source:
  - Sysmon EventID 6
search:
  "`sysmon` EventCode=6 | lookup loldrivers driver_name AS ImageLoaded OUTPUT
  is_driver driver_description | search is_driver = TRUE | stats  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime count by dest ImageLoaded driver_description | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_vulnerable_driver_loaded_filter`"
how_to_implement:
  Sysmon collects driver loads via EventID 6, however you may modify
  the query to utilize this lookup to identify potentially persistent drivers that
  are known to be vulnerable.
known_false_positives:
  False positives will be present. Drill down into the driver
  further by version number and cross reference by signer. Review the reference material
  in the lookup. In addition, modify the query to look within specific paths, which
  will remove a lot of "normal" drivers.
