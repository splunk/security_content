- Endpoint
description: This analytic identifies a potential adversary that changes the security
  permission of a specific file or directory. This technique is commonly seen in APT
  tradecraft or coinminer scripts. This behavior is meant to evade detection and prevent
  access to their component files.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "icacls.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name = "cacls.exe" OR Processes.process_name = "xcacls.exe"
  AND Processes.process = "*/deny*" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `icacls_deny_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed icacls.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Unknown. It is possible some administrative scripts use ICacls.
  Filter as needed.
