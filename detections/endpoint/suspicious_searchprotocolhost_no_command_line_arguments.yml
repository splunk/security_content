- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies searchprotocolhost.exe with no command
  line arguments. It is unusual for searchprotocolhost.exe to execute with no command
  line arguments present. This particular behavior is common with malicious software,
  including Cobalt Strike. During investigation, identify any network connections
  and parallel processes. Identify any suspicious module loads related to credential
  dumping or file writes. searchprotocolhost.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32
  and C:\Windows\syswow64.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=searchprotocolhost.exe by _time span=1h  Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_name Processes.dest Processes.process_path Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | regex process="(searchprotocolhost\.exe.{0,4}$)"  | `suspicious_searchprotocolhost_no_command_line_arguments_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present in small environments.
  Tuning may be required based on parent process.
