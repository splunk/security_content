description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious PowerShell script execution via EventCode 4104 that contains multiple URLs within a function or array.
 This is typically found in obfuscated PowerShell or PowerShell executing embedded .NET or binary files that are attempting to download 2nd stage payloads. 
 During triage, review parallel processes within the same timeframe. Review the full script block to identify other related artifacts.

how_to_implement: The following analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Unknown, possible custom scripting.
