description: The following analytic detects potential WMI token impersonation activities
  in a process or command. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 10 to identify instances
  where `wmiprvse.exe` has a duplicate handle or full granted access in a target process.
  This behavior is significant as it is commonly used by malware like Qakbot for privilege
  escalation or defense evasion. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
  an attacker to gain elevated privileges, evade defenses, and maintain persistence
  within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 SourceImage = "*\\wmiprvse.exe"  GrantedAccess IN ("0x1478",
  "0x1fffff") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage
  TargetImage SourceProcessGUID TargetProcessGUID SourceProcessId TargetProcessId
  GrantedAccess CallTrace dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_wmi_impersonate_token_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requires Sysmon Logs and a Sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 10. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`. We strongly
  recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source,
  sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations
  for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to
  filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: administrator may execute impersonate wmi object script for
  auditing. Filter is needed.
