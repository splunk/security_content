description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'apt-get' command
  with elevated privileges using 'sudo' on a Linux system. It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs
  that include command-line details. This activity is significant because it indicates
  a user may be attempting to escalate privileges to root, which could lead to unauthorized
  system control. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain root access, allowing
  them to execute arbitrary commands, install or remove software, and potentially
  compromise the entire system.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*apt-get*"
  AND Processes.process="*APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*"

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
