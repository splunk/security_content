description: The following analytic detects the execution of hh.exe (HTML Help) loading
  a Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file from a remote URL. This detection leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
  containing URLs. This activity is significant as it can indicate an attempt to execute
  malicious scripts via CHM files, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to run scripts using engines
  like JScript or VBScript, leading to further system compromise or data exfiltration.

- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_hh` Processes.process=*http*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_html_help_url_in_command_line_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may retrieve
  a CHM remotely, filter as needed.
