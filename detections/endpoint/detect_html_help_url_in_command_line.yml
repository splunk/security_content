description: The following analytic identifies hh.exe (HTML Help) execution of a Compiled
  HTML Help (CHM) file from a remote url. This particular technique will load Windows
  script code from a compiled help file. CHM files may  contain nearly any file type
  embedded, but only execute html/htm. Upon a successful execution, the following
  script engines may be used for execution - JScript, VBScript, VBScript.Encode, JScript.Encode,
  JScript.Compact. Analyst may identify vbscript.dll or jscript.dll loading into hh.exe
  upon execution. The "htm" and "html" file extensions were the only extensions observed
  to be supported for the execution of Shortcut commands or WSH script code. During
  investigation, identify script content origination. Review reputation of remote
  IP and domain. Some instances, it is worth decompiling the .chm file to review its
  original contents. hh.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_hh`
  Processes.process=*http* by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_html_help_url_in_command_line_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may retrieve
  a CHM remotely, filter as needed.
