description: The following analytic is designed to spot instances of 'svchost.exe'
  initiating a Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS) execution process.
  Often, adversaries manipulate Task Scheduler to execute code on remote endpoints,
  resulting in the spawning of a malicious command as a child process of 'svchost.exe'.
  By tracking child processes of 'svchost.exe' that align with the LOLBAS project,
  potential lateral movement activity can be detected. The analytic examines process
  details, including the process name, parent process, and command-line executions.
  A comprehensive list of LOLBAS processes is included in the search parameters. Although
  the analytic might catch legitimate applications exhibiting this behavior, these
  instances should be filtered accordingly. The findings from this analytic offer
  valuable insight into potentially malicious activities on an endpoint.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may trigger this behavior, filter as
  needed.
