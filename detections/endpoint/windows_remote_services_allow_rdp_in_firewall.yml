description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows firewall
  to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on a targeted machine. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
  involving "netsh.exe" to allow TCP port 3389. This activity is significant as it
  may indicate an adversary attempting to gain remote access to a compromised host,
  a common tactic for lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to remotely control the system, leading to potential data exfiltration or further
  network compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
