description: The following analytic is to identify a modification in the Windows firewall
  to enable remote desktop protocol on a targeted machine. This technique was seen
  in several adversaries, malware or red teamer to remotely access the compromised
  or targeted host by allowing this protocol in firewall. Even this protocol might
  be allowed in some production environment, This TTP behavior is a good pivot to
  check who and why the user want to enable this feature through firewall which is
  also common traits of attack to start lateral movement.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
