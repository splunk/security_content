description: The following analytic is to identify a modification in the Windows firewall
  to enable remote desktop protocol on a targeted machine. This technique was seen
  in several adversaries, malware or red teamer to remotely access the compromised
  or targeted host by allowing this protocol in firewall. Even this protocol might
  be allowed in some production environment, This TTP behavior is a good pivot to
  check who and why the user want to enable this feature through firewall which is
  also common traits of attack to start lateral movement.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as cmdline
  values(Processes.parent_process_name) as parent_process values(Processes.process_name)
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name = "netsh.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name= "netsh.exe")
  AND Processes.process = "*firewall*" AND Processes.process = "*add*" AND Processes.process
  = "*protocol=TCP*" AND Processes.process = "*localport=3389*" AND Processes.process
  = "*action=allow*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_services_allow_rdp_in_firewall_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4
  of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
