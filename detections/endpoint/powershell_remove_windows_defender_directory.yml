description: This analytic will identify a suspicious PowerShell command used to delete
  the Windows Defender folder. This technique was seen used by the WhisperGate malware
  campaign where it used Nirsofts advancedrun.exe to gain administrative privileges
  to then execute a PowerShell command to delete the Windows Defender folder. This
  is a good indicator the offending process is trying corrupt a Windows Defender installation.

- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*rmdir *" AND ScriptBlockText
  = "*\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender*" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by Opcode Computer UserID EventCode ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
