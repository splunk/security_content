description: The following analytic detects the use of certutil to download software,
  specifically when spawned by SQL-related processes. This detection leverages Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on command-line executions involving
  certutil with parameters like *urlcache* and *split*. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate a compromise by threat actors, such as Flax Typhoon, who use
  certutil to establish persistent VPN connections. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could allow attackers to maintain access, monitor system availability, and potentially
  escalate to data theft or ransomware deployment.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("sqlservr.exe", "sqlagent.exe", "sqlps.exe", "launchpad.exe", "sqldumper.exe")

  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_sql_spawning_certutil_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: The occurrence of false positives should be minimal, given
  that the SQL agent does not typically download software using CertUtil.
