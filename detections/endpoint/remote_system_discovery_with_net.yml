description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `net.exe` or `net1.exe`
  with command-line arguments used to discover remote systems, such as `domain computers
  /domain`. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
  as it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by adversaries or Red Teams to
  map out networked systems and Active Directory structures. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could lead to further network exploitation, privilege escalation,
  or lateral movement within the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="net.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="net1.exe") (Processes.process="*domain computers*" AND
  Processes.process=*/do*) OR (Processes.process="*view*" AND Processes.process=*/do*)

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_system_discovery_with_net_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
