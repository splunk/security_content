description: The following analytic detects the creation of shim database files (.sdb)
  in default directories using the sdbinst.exe application. It leverages filesystem
  activity data from the Endpoint.Filesystem data model to identify file writes to
  the Windows\AppPatch\Custom directory. This activity is significant because shims
  can intercept and alter API calls, potentially allowing attackers to bypass security
  controls or execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Filesystem.action)
  values(Filesystem.file_hash) as file_hash values(Filesystem.file_path) as file_path  min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path=*Windows\\AppPatch\\Custom*
  by Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.dest | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `shim_database_file_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data model node. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
known_false_positives: Because legitimate shim files are created and used all the
  time, this event, in itself, is not suspicious. However, if there are other correlating
  events, it may warrant further investigation.
