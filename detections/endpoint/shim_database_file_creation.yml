description: This search looks for shim database files being written to default directories.
  The sdbinst.exe application is used to install shim database files (.sdb). According
  to Microsoft, a shim is a small library that transparently intercepts an API, changes
  the parameters passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation
  elsewhere.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data model node. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.

known_false_positives: Because legitimate shim files are created and used all the
  time, this event, in itself, is not suspicious. However, if there are other correlating
  events, it may warrant further investigation.
