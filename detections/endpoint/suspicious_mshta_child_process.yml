description: The following analytic identifies child processes spawned from "mshta.exe".
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  specific child processes like "powershell.exe" and "cmd.exe". This activity is significant
  because "mshta.exe" is often exploited by attackers to execute malicious scripts
  or commands. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to execute
  arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment.
  Monitoring this activity helps in early detection of potential threats leveraging
  "mshta.exe" for malicious purposes.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
