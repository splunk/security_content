description: The following analytic identifies child processes spawning from  "mshta.exe".
  The search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments
  were used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, parent process
  "mshta.exe" and its child process.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=mshta.exe
  AND (Processes.process_name=powershell.exe OR Processes.process_name=colorcpl.exe
  OR Processes.process_name=msbuild.exe OR Processes.process_name=microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe
  OR Processes.process_name=searchprotocolhost.exe OR Processes.process_name=scrcons.exe
  OR Processes.process_name=cscript.exe OR Processes.process_name=wscript.exe OR Processes.process_name=powershell.exe
  OR Processes.process_name=cmd.exe) by Processes.dest Processes.parent_process Processes.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_mshta_child_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
