description: The following analytic identifies child processes spawning from  "mshta.exe".
  The search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments
  were used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, parent process
  "mshta.exe" and its child process.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name)
  as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=mshta.exe
  AND (Processes.process_name=powershell.exe OR Processes.process_name=colorcpl.exe
  OR Processes.process_name=msbuild.exe OR Processes.process_name=microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
