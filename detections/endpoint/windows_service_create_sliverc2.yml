author: Michael Haag, Splunk
type: TTP
status: production
data_source:
- Windows System 7045
description: When an adversary utilizes SliverC2 to laterally move with the Psexec module, it will create a service with the name and description of "Sliver" and "Sliver Implant". Note that these may be easily changed and are specific to only SliverC2.
  We have also created the same regex as Microsoft has outlined to attempt to capture the suspicious service path (regex101 reference).
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ServiceName="sliver"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode ImagePath ServiceName ServiceType 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_create_sliverc2_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, the Windows EventCode 7045 will need to be logged from the System Event log. The Windows TA for Splunk is also recommended.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if another service out there is named Sliver, filtering may be needed.
