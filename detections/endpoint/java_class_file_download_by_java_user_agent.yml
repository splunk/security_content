description: The following analytic identifies a Java user agent performing a GET request for a .class file from a remote site. It leverages web or proxy logs within the Web Datamodel to detect this activity. This behavior is significant as it may indicate exploitation attempts, such as those related to CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell). If confirmed malicious, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the Java application, potentially leading to remote code execution and further compromise of the affected system.

search: '| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.http_user_agent="*Java*" Web.http_method="GET" Web.url="*.class*" by Web.http_user_agent Web.http_method, Web.url,Web.url_length Web.src, Web.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `java_class_file_download_by_java_user_agent_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting web or proxy logs, or ensure it is being filled by a proxy like device, into the Web Datamodel. For additional filtering, allow list private IP space or restrict by known good.
known_false_positives: Filtering may be required in some instances, filter as needed.
