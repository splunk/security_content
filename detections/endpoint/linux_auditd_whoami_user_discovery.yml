description: The following analytic detects the suspicious use of the whoami command,
  which may indicate an attacker trying to gather information about the current user
  account on a compromised system. The whoami command is commonly used to verify user
  privileges and identity, especially during initial stages of an attack to assess
  the level of access. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized executions of whoami,
  this analytic helps in identifying potential reconnaissance activities, enabling
  security teams to take action before the attacker escalates privileges or conducts
  further malicious operations.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL comm=whoami OR exe= "*/whoami" | rename host
  as dest | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by comm exe  SYSCALL
  UID ppid pid dest success | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `linux_auditd_whoami_user_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
