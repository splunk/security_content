description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry related to authentication level settings.
  This registry is the configuration for authentication level settings within the Terminal Server Client settings in Windows.
  AuthenticationLevelOverride might be used to control or override the authentication level used by the Terminal Server Client for remote connections.
  DarkGate malware modify this registry as part of its malicious installation in a targeted host for its remote desktop capabilities.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry 
  where Registry.registry_path = "*\\Terminal Server Client\\AuthenticationLevelOverride"  Registry.registry_value_data = 0x00000000
  by  Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid Registry.action Registry.user Registry.dest

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_authenticationleveloverride_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
