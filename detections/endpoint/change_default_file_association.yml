description: This analytic is developed to detect suspicious registry modification
  to change the default file association of windows to malicious payload. This technique
  was seen in some APT where it modify the default process to run file association,
  like .txt to notepad.exe. Instead notepad.exe it will point to a Script or other
  payload that will load malicious commands to the compromised host.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path
  ="*\\shell\\open\\command\\*" Registry.registry_path = "*HKCR\\*" by Registry.dest  Registry.user

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
