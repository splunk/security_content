description: The following analytic detects suspicious registry modifications that change the default file association to execute a malicious payload. It leverages data from the Endpoint data model, specifically monitoring registry paths under "*\\shell\\open\\command\\*" and "*HKCR\\*". This activity is significant because altering default file associations can allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts or payloads when a user opens a file, leading to potential code execution. If confirmed malicious, this technique can enable attackers to persist on the compromised host and execute further malicious commands, posing a severe threat to the environment.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes to the registry.
