description: The following analytic detects suspicious registry modifications that
  change the default file association to execute a malicious payload. It leverages
  data from the Endpoint data model, specifically monitoring registry paths under
  "*\\shell\\open\\command\\*" and "*HKCR\\*". This activity is significant because
  altering default file associations can allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts
  or payloads when a user opens a file, leading to potential code execution. If confirmed
  malicious, this technique can enable attackers to persist on the compromised host
  and execute further malicious commands, posing a severe threat to the environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path
  ="*\\shell\\open\\command\\*" Registry.registry_path = "*HKCR\\*" by Registry.dest  Registry.user

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
