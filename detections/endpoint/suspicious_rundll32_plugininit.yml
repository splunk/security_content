description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the rundll32.exe process
  with the "plugininit" parameter. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events and command-line
  arguments. This activity is significant because the "plugininit" parameter is commonly
  associated with IcedID malware, which uses it to execute an initial DLL stager to
  download additional payloads. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to
  further malware infections, data exfiltration, or complete system compromise.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` Processes.process=*PluginInit*
  by  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.dest

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_rundll32_plugininit_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: third party application may used this dll export name to execute
  function.
