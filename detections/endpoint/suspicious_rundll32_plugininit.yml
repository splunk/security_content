- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect a suspicious rundll32.exe process with plugininit
  parameter. This technique is commonly seen in IceID malware to execute its initial
  dll stager to download another payload to the compromised machine.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=rundll32.exe
  Processes.process=*PluginInit* by  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.dest
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_rundll32_plugininit_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: third party application may used this dll export name to execute
  function.
