description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the rundll32.exe process with the "plugininit" parameter. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because the "plugininit" parameter is commonly associated with IcedID malware, which uses it to execute an initial DLL stager to download additional payloads. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to further malware infections, data exfiltration, or complete system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
