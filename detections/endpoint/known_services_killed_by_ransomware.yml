description: This search detects a suspicioous termination of known services killed
  by ransomware before encrypting files in a compromised machine. This technique is
  commonly seen in most of ransomware now a days to avoid exception error while accessing
  the targetted files it wants to encrypts because of the open handle of those services
  to the targetted file.

- Sysmon Event ID 7

  lastTime by EventCode param1 dest | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the 7036 EventCode ScManager in System audit Logs from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Admin activities or installing related updates may do a sudden
  stop to list of services we monitor.
