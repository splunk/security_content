type: TTP
description: This search looks for the execution of `nltest.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for Domain Trust information. Two arguments `/domain
  trusts`, returns a list of trusted domains, and `/all_trusts`, returns all trusted
  domains. Red Teams and adversaries alike use NLTest.exe to enumerate the current
  domain to assist with further understanding where to pivot next.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_nltest` (Processes.process=*/domain_trusts*
  OR Processes.process=*/all_trusts*) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `nltest_domain_trust_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may use nltest for troubleshooting purposes,
  otherwise, rarely used.
