description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `nltest.exe` with
  command-line arguments `/domain_trusts` or `/all_trusts` to query Domain Trust information.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process execution logs and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
  as it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to understand domain
  trust relationships, which can inform their lateral movement strategies. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could enable attackers to map out trusted domains, facilitating
  further compromise and pivoting within the network.

- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_nltest` (Processes.process=*/domain_trusts*
  OR Processes.process=*/all_trusts*) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `nltest_domain_trust_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may use nltest for troubleshooting purposes,
  otherwise, rarely used.
