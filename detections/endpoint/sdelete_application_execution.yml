description: This analytic is to detect the execution of sdelete.exe application sysinternal
  tools. This tool is one of the most use tool of malware and adversaries to remove
  or clear their tracks and artifact in the targetted host. This tool is designed
  to delete securely a file in file system that remove the forensic evidence on the
  machine. A good TTP query to check why user execute this application which is not
  a common practice.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process values(Processes.process_id)
  as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_sdelete` by  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
