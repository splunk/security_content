description: The following analytic detects the execution of the sdelete.exe application, a Sysinternals tool often used by adversaries to securely delete files and remove forensic evidence from a targeted host. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. Monitoring this activity is crucial as sdelete.exe is not commonly used in regular operations and its presence may indicate an attempt to cover malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to the loss of critical forensic data, hindering incident response and investigation efforts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
