type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects suspicious process access by spoolsv.exe,
  potentially indicating exploitation of the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527).
  It leverages Sysmon EventCode 10 to identify when spoolsv.exe accesses critical
  system files or processes like rundll32.exe with elevated privileges. This activity
  is significant as it may signal an attempt to gain unauthorized privilege escalation
  on a vulnerable machine. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could achieve elevated
  privileges, leading to further system compromise, persistent access, or unauthorized
  control over the affected environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 SourceImage = "*\\spoolsv.exe" CallTrace = "*\\Windows\\system32\\spool\\DRIVERS\\x64\\*"
  TargetImage IN ("*\\rundll32.exe", "*\\spoolsv.exe") GrantedAccess = 0x1fffff |
  stats  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest SourceImage
  TargetImage GrantedAccess CallTrace  EventCode ProcessID| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `spoolsv_suspicious_process_access_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with process access event where SourceImage, TargetImage, GrantedAccess and
  CallTrace executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have
  at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of spoolsv.exe.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Filter as needed.
