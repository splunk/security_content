description: This analytic identifies a suspicious behavior related to PrintNightmare,
  or CVE-2021-34527 previously (CVE-2021-1675),  to gain privilege escalation on the
  vulnerable machine. This exploit attacks a critical Windows Print Spooler Vulnerability
  to elevate privilege. This detection is to look for suspicious process access made
  by the spoolsv.exe that may related to the attack.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 SourceImage = "*\\spoolsv.exe" CallTrace = "*\\Windows\\system32\\spool\\DRIVERS\\x64\\*"
  TargetImage IN ("*\\rundll32.exe", "*\\spoolsv.exe") GrantedAccess = 0x1fffff |
  stats  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer SourceImage
  TargetImage GrantedAccess CallTrace  EventCode ProcessID| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `spoolsv_suspicious_process_access_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with process access event where SourceImage, TargetImage, GrantedAccess and
  CallTrace executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have
  at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of spoolsv.exe.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Filter as needed.
