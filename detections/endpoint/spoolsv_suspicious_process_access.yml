description: This analytic identifies a suspicious behavior related to PrintNightmare,
  or CVE-2021-1675,  to gain privilege escalation on the vulnerable machine. This
  exploit attacks a critical Windows Print Spooler Vulnerability to elevate privilege.
  This detection is to look for suspicious process access made by the spoolsv.exe
  that may related to the attack.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 SourceImage = "*\\spoolsv.exe" CallTrace = "*\\Windows\\system32\\spool\\DRIVERS\\x64\\*"
  TargetImage IN ("*\\rundll32.exe", "*\\spoolsv.exe") GrantedAccess = 0x1fffff |
  stats  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer SourceImage
  TargetImage GrantedAccess CallTrace  EventCode ProcessID| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `spoolsv_suspicious_process_access_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with process access event where SourceImage, TargetImage, GrantedAccess and
  CallTrace executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have
  at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of spoolsv.exe.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Filter as needed.
