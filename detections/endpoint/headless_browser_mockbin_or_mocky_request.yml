description: The following analytic identifies headless browser activity accessing mockbin.org or mocky.io. Mockbin.org and mocky.io are web services that allow users to mock HTTP requests and responses. The detection is based on the presence of "--headless" and "--disable-gpu" command line arguments which are commonly used in headless browsing and the presence of mockbin.org or mocky.io in the process.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where 
  (Processes.process="*--headless*" AND Processes.process="*--disable-gpu*" AND (Processes.process="*mockbin.org/*" OR Processes.process="*mocky.io/*")) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `headless_browser_mockbin_or_mocky_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives are not expected with this detection, unless within the organization there is a legitimate need for headless browsing accessing mockbin.org or mocky.io.
