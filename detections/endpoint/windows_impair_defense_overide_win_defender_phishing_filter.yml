description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to disable windows defender 
  phishing filter. This setting controls whether users can manually disable or modify the browser's built-in phishing filter.
  When attackers modify "PreventOverride" to 0, it might indicate an attempt to disable the prevention of user overrides for 
  the phishing filter within Microsoft Edge. This change allows users to bypass or disable the built-in phishing protection provided by the browser.
  By allowing users to override the phishing filter, attackers may attempt to deceive users into visiting phishing websites or 
  malicious pages without triggering warnings or protections from the browser's built-in security measures. This manipulation increases the 
  risk of users unknowingly accessing potentially harmful websites, leading to potential security incidents or compromises.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_key_name = "*\\MicrosoftEdge\\PhishingFilter" Registry.registry_value_name IN ("EnabledV9", "PreventOverride")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
