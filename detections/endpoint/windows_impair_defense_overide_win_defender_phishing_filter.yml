description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry that disable the Windows Defender phishing filter. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, focusing on changes to specific registry values related to Microsoft Edge's phishing filter settings. This activity is significant because disabling the phishing filter can allow attackers to deceive users into visiting malicious websites without triggering browser warnings. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to users unknowingly accessing harmful sites, resulting in potential security incidents or data compromises.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_key_name = "*\\MicrosoftEdge\\PhishingFilter" Registry.registry_value_name IN ("EnabledV9", "PreventOverride") Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000000" by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_overide_win_defender_phishing_filter_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro to tune the search.
