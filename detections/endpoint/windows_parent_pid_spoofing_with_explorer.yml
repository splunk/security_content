description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious explorer.exe process that has "/root" process commandline. 
  The presence of this parameter is considered a significant indicator as it could indicate attempts at spoofing the parent process 
  by a specific program or malware. By spoofing the parent process, the malicious entity aims to circumvent detection mechanisms and 
  operate undetected within the system.
  This technique of manipulating the command-line parameter (/root) of explorer.exe is a form of masquerading utilized by certain malware 
  or suspicious processes. The objective is to obscure the true nature of the activity by imitating a legitimate system process. By doing so, 
  it attempts to evade scrutiny and evade detection by security measures.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
