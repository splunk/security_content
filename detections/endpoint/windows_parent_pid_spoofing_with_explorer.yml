description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious `explorer.exe` process
  with the `/root` command-line parameter. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process and command-line data. The presence
  of `/root` in `explorer.exe` is significant as it may indicate parent process spoofing,
  a technique used by malware to evade detection. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow an attacker to operate undetected, potentially leading to unauthorized
  access, privilege escalation, or persistent threats within the environment.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*explorer.exe*"
  Processes.process="*/root,*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_parent_pid_spoofing_with_explorer_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
