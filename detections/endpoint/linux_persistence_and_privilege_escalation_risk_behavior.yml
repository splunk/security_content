type: Correlation
datamodel:
- Risk
description: The following correlation is specific to Linux persistence and privilege escalation tactics and is tied to two analytic stories and any Linux analytic tied to persistence and privilege escalation.
  These techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features that let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.

how_to_implement: Ensure Linux anomaly and TTP analytics are enabled. TTP may be set to Notables for point detections, anomaly should not be notables but risk generators. The correlation relies on more than x amount of distict detection names generated before generating a notable. Modify the value as needed. Default value is set to 4. This value may need to be increased based on activity in your environment.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on many factors. Tune the correlation as needed to reduce too many triggers.
