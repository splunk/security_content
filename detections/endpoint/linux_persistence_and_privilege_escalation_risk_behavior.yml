description: The following analytic identifies potential Linux persistence and privilege
  escalation activities. It leverages risk scores and event counts from various Linux-related
  data sources, focusing on tactics associated with persistence and privilege escalation.
  This activity is significant for a SOC because it highlights behaviors that could
  allow an attacker to maintain access or gain elevated privileges on a Linux system.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable an attacker to execute code with
  higher privileges, persist in the environment, and potentially access sensitive
  information, posing a severe security risk.

how_to_implement: Ensure Linux anomaly and TTP analytics are enabled. TTP may be set
  to Notables for point detections, anomaly should not be notables but risk generators.
  The correlation relies on more than x amount of distict detection names generated
  before generating a notable. Modify the value as needed. Default value is set to
  4. This value may need to be increased based on activity in your environment.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on many factors. Tune
  the correlation as needed to reduce too many triggers.
