description: DiskShadow.exe is a Microsoft Signed binary present on Windows Server.
  It has a scripting mode intended for complex scripted backup operations. This feature
  also allows for execution of arbitrary unsigned code. This analytic looks for the
  usage of the scripting mode flags in executions of DiskShadow. During triage, compare
  to known backup behavior in your environment and then review the scripts called
  by diskshadow.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_diskshadow` (Processes.process=*-s*
  OR Processes.process=*/s*) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_diskshadow_proxy_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators using the DiskShadow tool in their infrastructure
  as a main backup tool with scripts will cause false positives that can be filtered
  with `windows_diskshadow_proxy_execution_filter`
