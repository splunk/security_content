description: This analytic detects network share discovery and collection activities performed on Windows systems using the Net command.
  Attackers often use network share discovery to identify accessible shared resources within a network,
  which can be a precursor to privilege escalation or data exfiltration. By monitoring Windows Event Logs for
  the usage of the Net command to list and interact with network shares, this detection helps identify potential reconnaissance and collection
  activities.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data originating from either Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry or EventCode 4688 with 
  process command line logging enabled. These sources provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints. To implement this search, you must 
  ingest logs that contain the process name, parent process, and complete command-line executions. These logs must be mapped to the Splunk Common 
  Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names capture the data within the datamodel schema.
