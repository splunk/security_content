description: The following analytic leverages Kerberos Event 4769, A Kerberos service
  ticket was requested, to identify a potential kerberoasting attack against Active
  Directory networks. Kerberoasting allows an adversary to request kerberos tickets
  for domain accounts typically used as service accounts and attempt to crack them
  offline allowing them to obtain privileged access to the domain. This analytic looks
  for a specific combination of the Ticket_Options field based on common kerberoasting
  tools. Defenders should be aware that it may be possible for a Kerberoast attack
  to use different Ticket_Options.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4769
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4769 ServiceName!="*$" (TicketOptions=0x40810000 OR TicketOptions=0x40800000 OR TicketOptions=0x40810010) TicketEncryptionType=0x17 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, service_id, service, TicketEncryptionType, TicketOptions | rename Computer as dest
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `kerberoasting_spn_request_with_rc4_encryption_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Older systems that support kerberos RC4 by default like NetApp
  may generate false positives. Filter as needed
