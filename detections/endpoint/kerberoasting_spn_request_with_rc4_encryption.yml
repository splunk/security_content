description: The following analytic detects potential Kerberoasting attacks by identifying
  Kerberos service ticket requests with RC4 encryption through Event ID 4769. It leverages
  specific Ticket_Options values commonly used by Kerberoasting tools. This activity
  is significant as Kerberoasting allows attackers to request service tickets for
  domain accounts, typically service accounts, and crack them offline to gain privileged
  access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, and further compromise of the Active Directory environment.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4769
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4769 ServiceName!="*$" (TicketOptions=0x40810000
  OR TicketOptions=0x40800000 OR TicketOptions=0x40810010) TicketEncryptionType=0x17
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, service_id,
  service, TicketEncryptionType, TicketOptions | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `kerberoasting_spn_request_with_rc4_encryption_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Older systems that support kerberos RC4 by default like NetApp
  may generate false positives. Filter as needed
