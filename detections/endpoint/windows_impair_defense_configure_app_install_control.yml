description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry that disable the Windows Defender SmartScreen App Install Control feature. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model to identify changes to specific registry values. This activity is significant because disabling App Install Control can allow users to install potentially malicious web-based applications without restrictions, increasing the risk of security vulnerabilities. If confirmed malicious, this action could lead to the installation of harmful applications, potentially compromising the system and exposing sensitive information.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry WHERE (Registry.registry_path= "*\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\SmartScreen\\ConfigureAppInstallControl" Registry.registry_value_data= "Anywhere") OR (Registry.registry_path= "*\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\SmartScreen\\ConfigureAppInstallControlEnabled" Registry.registry_value_data= "0x00000000") BY _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_configure_app_install_control_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro to tune the search.
