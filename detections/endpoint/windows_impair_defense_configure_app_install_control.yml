description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to change or disable Windows Defender 
  smartscreen app install control. Microsoft Edge's App Install Control feature helps manage the installation of web-based applications.
  When attackers modify "ConfigureAppInstallControlEnabled" to 0, they are likely attempting to disable the App Install Control feature 
  in Microsoft Edge. This change might allow users to bypass restrictions imposed by the browser on the installation of web-based applications.
  Disabling this feature might increase the risk of users being able to install potentially malicious or untrusted web applications without 
  restrictions or controls imposed by the browser. This action could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or compromise if users 
  inadvertently install harmful applications.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
