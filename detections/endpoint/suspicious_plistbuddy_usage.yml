description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of the native macOS utility,
  PlistBuddy, to create or modify property list (.plist) files. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
  and command-line executions involving PlistBuddy. This activity is significant because
  PlistBuddy can be used to establish persistence by modifying LaunchAgents, as seen
  in the Silver Sparrow malware. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to maintain persistence, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially escalate privileges
  on the compromised macOS system.'

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=PlistBuddy
  (Processes.process=*LaunchAgents* OR Processes.process=*RunAtLoad* OR Processes.process=*true*)
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` |  `suspicious_plistbuddy_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications may use PlistBuddy to create or
  modify property lists and possibly generate false positives. Review the property
  list being modified or created to confirm.
