description: The following analytic detects the unusual invocation of the Windows Console Host process (conhost.exe) with the undocumented --headless parameter. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, specifically monitoring for command-line executions where conhost.exe is executed with the --headless argument. This activity is significant for a SOC as it is not commonly used in legitimate operations and may indicate an attacker's attempt to execute commands stealthily. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to persistence, lateral movement, or other malicious activities, potentially resulting in data exfiltration or system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the application is legitimately used, filter by user or endpoint as needed.
