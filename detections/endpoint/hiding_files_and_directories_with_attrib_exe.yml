description: Attackers leverage an existing Windows binary, attrib.exe, to mark specific
  as hidden by using specific flags so that the victim does not see the file.  The
  search looks for specific command-line arguments to detect the use of attrib.exe
  to hide files.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) values(Processes.process)

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: 'Some applications and users may legitimately use attrib.exe
  to interact with the files. '
