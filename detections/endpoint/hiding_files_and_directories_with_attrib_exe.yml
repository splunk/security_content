description: Attackers leverage an existing Windows binary, attrib.exe, to mark specific
  as hidden by using specific flags so that the victim does not see the file.  The
  search looks for specific command-line arguments to detect the use of attrib.exe
  to hide files.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
