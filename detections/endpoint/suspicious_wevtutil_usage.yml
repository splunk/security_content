description: The wevtutil.exe application is the windows event log utility. This searches
  for wevtutil.exe with parameters for clearing the application, security, setup,
  trace or system event logs.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=wevtutil.exe Processes.process IN ("* cl *", "*clear-log*")
  (Processes.process="*System*" OR Processes.process="*Security*" OR Processes.process="*Setup*"
  OR Processes.process="*Application*" OR Processes.process="*trace*") by Processes.process_name
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest Processes.user| `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_wevtutil_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: The wevtutil.exe application is a legitimate Windows event
  log utility. Administrators may use it to manage Windows event logs.
