description: The wevtutil.exe application is the windows event log utility. This searches
  for wevtutil.exe with parameters for clearing the application, security, setup,
  or system event logs.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name = wevtutil.exe Processes.process="*cl*" (Processes.process="*System*"
  OR Processes.process="*Security*" OR Processes.process="*Setup*" OR Processes.process="*Application*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest Processes.user|
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_wevtutil_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
known_false_positives: The wevtutil.exe application is a legitimate Windows event
  log utility. Administrators may use it to manage Windows event logs.
