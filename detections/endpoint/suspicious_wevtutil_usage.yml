description: The following analytic detects the usage of wevtutil.exe with parameters
  for clearing event logs such as Application, Security, Setup, Trace, or System.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because clearing
  event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious actions, hindering
  forensic investigations. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker
  to erase evidence of their activities, making it difficult to trace their actions
  and understand the full scope of the compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=wevtutil.exe Processes.process IN ("* cl *", "*clear-log*")
  (Processes.process="*System*" OR Processes.process="*Security*" OR Processes.process="*Setup*"
  OR Processes.process="*Application*" OR Processes.process="*trace*") by Processes.process_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_wevtutil_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: The wevtutil.exe application is a legitimate Windows event
  log utility. Administrators may use it to manage Windows event logs.
