description: The following analytic identifies the suspicious child process of calc.exe
  due to dll side loading technique to execute another executable. This technique
  was seen in qakbot malware that uses dll side loading technique to calc applications
  to load its malicious dll code. The malicious dll that abuses dll side loading technique
  will load the actual qakbot loader dll using regsvr32.exe application. This TTP
  is a good indicator of qakbot since the calc.exe will not load other child processes
  aside from win32calc.exe.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "calc.exe")  AND Processes.process_name != "win32calc.exe" by Processes.parent_process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
