description: The following analytic identifies suspicious child processes spawned
  by calc.exe, indicative of DLL side-loading techniques. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process GUIDs,
  names, and parent processes. This activity is significant as it is commonly associated
  with Qakbot malware, which uses calc.exe to load malicious DLLs via regsvr32.exe.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code, maintain persistence, and escalate privileges, posing a severe threat to the
  environment.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "calc.exe")  AND Processes.process_name != "win32calc.exe" by Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process
  Processes.user Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_dll_side_loading_process_child_of_calc_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
