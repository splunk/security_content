description: The following analytic identifies the suspicious child process of calc.exe due to dll side loading technique to execute another executable. 
  This technique was seen in qakbot malware that uses dll side loading technique to calc applications to load its malicious dll code. The malicious dll that abuses 
  dll side loading technique will load the actual qakbot loader dll using regsvr32.exe application. 
  This TTP is a good indicator of qakbot since the calc.exe will not load other child processes aside from win32calc.exe.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where (Processes.parent_process_name = "calc.exe")  AND Processes.process_name != "win32calc.exe"
  by Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process Processes.user Processes.dest

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process 
  that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` 
  datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and 
  the latest TA for the endpoint product.
