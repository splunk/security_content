description: The following analytic identifies four or more distinct post-exploitation
  behaviors on a Windows system. It leverages data from the Risk data model in Splunk
  Enterprise Security, focusing on multiple risk events and their associated MITRE
  ATT&CK tactics and techniques. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
  malicious actions following an initial compromise, such as persistence, privilege
  escalation, or data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow
  attackers to maintain control, escalate privileges, and further exploit the compromised
  environment, leading to significant security breaches and data loss.

  source_count >= 4 | `windows_post_exploitation_risk_behavior_filter`'
how_to_implement: Splunk Enterprise Security is required to utilize this correlation.
  In addition, modify the source_count value to your environment. In our testing,
  a count of 4 or 5 was decent in a lab, but the number may need to be increased base
  on internal testing. In addition, based on false positives, modify any analytics
  to be anomaly and lower or increase risk based on organization importance.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on many factors. Tune
  the correlation as needed to reduce too many triggers.
