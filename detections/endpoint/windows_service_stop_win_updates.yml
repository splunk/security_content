description: The following analytic identifies a windows update service being disabled in Windows OS. 
  This technique is being abused by adversaries or threat actors to add defense mechanisms to their malware implant in the targeted host. 
  Disabling windows update will put the compromised host vulnerable in some zero day exploit or even some update features against threats. 
  RedLine Stealer kills this service as part of its defense evasion mechanism.
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7040 
  (service_name IN ("Update Orchestrator Service for Windows Update", "WaaSMedicSvc", "Windows Update") OR param1 IN ("UsoSvc", "WaaSMedicSvc", "wuauserv")) AND 
  (param3=disabled OR start_mode = disabled) 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer Error_Code service_name start_mode param1 param2 param3 param4 
  | rename Computer as dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_service_stop_win_updates_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints (like Windows system.log Event ID 7040)
known_false_positives: Network administrator may disable this services as part of its audit process within the network. Filter is needed.
