description: The following analytic detects the disabling of Windows Update services,
  such as "Update Orchestrator Service for Windows Update," "WaaSMedicSvc," and "Windows
  Update." It leverages Windows System Event ID 7040 logs to identify changes in service
  start modes to 'disabled.' This activity is significant as it can indicate an adversary's
  attempt to evade defenses by preventing critical updates, leaving the system vulnerable
  to exploits. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain persistence
  and exploit unpatched vulnerabilities, compromising the integrity and security of
  the affected host.
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7040 (service_name IN ("Update Orchestrator
  Service for Windows Update", "WaaSMedicSvc", "Windows Update") OR param1 IN ("UsoSvc",
  "WaaSMedicSvc", "wuauserv")) AND (param3=disabled OR start_mode = disabled) | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer Error_Code service_name
  start_mode param1 param2 param3 param4 | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_service_stop_win_updates_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints (like Windows system.log Event ID 7040)
known_false_positives: Network administrator may disable this services as part of
  its audit process within the network. Filter is needed.
