description: this detection was designed to identifies suspicious office documents
  that connect to a website aside from Microsoft Office Domain. This technique was seen in 
  several malicious documents that abuses .rels xml properties of MS office to connect or download malicious files. 
  This hunting query can a good pivot or guide to check what URL link it tries to connect, what domain, where the documents came from and 
  how the connection happens.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Windows Office document may contain legitimate url link other than MS office Domain. filter is needed
