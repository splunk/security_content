description: The following analytic identifies suspicious Office documents that connect
  to non-Microsoft Office domains. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 22 to detect processes
  like winword.exe or excel.exe making DNS queries to domains outside of *.office.com
  or *.office.net. This activity is significant as it may indicate a spearphishing
  attempt using malicious documents to download or connect to harmful content. If
  confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized data access, malware infection,
  or further network compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 Image IN ("*\\winword.exe","*\\excel.exe","*\\powerpnt.exe","*\\mspub.exe","*\\visio.exe","*\\wordpad.exe","*\\wordview.exe","*\\onenote.exe",
  "*\\onenotem.exe","*\\onenoteviewer.exe","*\\onenoteim.exe", "*\\msaccess.exe")
  AND NOT(QueryName IN ("*.office.com", "*.office.net")) | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName QueryResults QueryStatus
  Computer | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_spearphishing_attachment_connect_to_none_ms_office_domain_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Windows Office document may contain legitimate url link other
  than MS office Domain. filter is needed
