description: The following analytic detects the spawning of mshta.exe by wmiprvse.exe or svchost.exe. This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process creation events where the parent process is either wmiprvse.exe or svchost.exe. This activity is significant as it may indicate the use of a DCOM object to execute malicious scripts via mshta.exe, a common tactic in sophisticated attacks. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise and further malicious activities.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit this behavior, triggering a false positive.
