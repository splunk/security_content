description: The following analytic identifies wmiprvse.exe spawning mshta.exe. This
  behavior is indicative of a DCOM object being utilized to spawn mshta from wmiprvse.exe
  or svchost.exe. In this instance, adversaries may use LethalHTA that will spawn
  mshta.exe from svchost.exe.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
