description: This search looks for the execution of the cscript.exe or wscript.exe
  processes, with a parent of cmd.exe. The search will return the count, the first
  and last time this execution was seen on a machine, the user, and the destination
  of the machine
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4
  of the Sysmon TA.
