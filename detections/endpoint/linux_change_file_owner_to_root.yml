type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic looks for a commandline that change the file owner to root
  using chown utility tool. This technique is commonly abuse by adversaries, malware
  author and red teamers to escalate privilege to the targeted or compromised host
  by changing the owner of their malicious file to root. This event is not so common
  in corporate network except from the administrator doing normal task that needs
  high privilege.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name = chown
  OR Processes.process = "*chown *") AND Processes.process = "* root *" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_change_file_owner_to_root_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
