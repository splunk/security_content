description: The following analytic identifies the use of the "remotesigned" execution
  policy for PowerShell scripts. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions containing "remotesigned" and
  "-File". This activity is significant because the "remotesigned" policy allows locally
  created scripts to run without restrictions, posing a potential security risk. If
  confirmed malicious, an attacker could execute unauthorized scripts, leading to
  code execution, privilege escalation, or persistence within the environment.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell` Processes.process="*
  remotesigned *" Processes.process="* -File *" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_powershell_remotesigned_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible administrators or scripts may run these commands,
  filtering may be required.
