- Sysmon EventID 7
description: The following analytic detects the creation of potentially malicious
  unsigned DLLs in the c:\windows\system32 or c:\windows\syswow64 folders. It leverages
  Sysmon EventCode 7 logs to identify unsigned DLLs with unavailable signatures loaded
  in these critical directories. This activity is significant as it may indicate a
  DLL hijacking attempt, a technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access
  and execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to privilege
  escalation, allowing the attacker to gain elevated privileges and further compromise
  the target system.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 Signed=false OriginalFileName = "-" SignatureStatus="unavailable"
  ImageLoaded IN ("*:\\windows\\system32\\*", "*:\\windows\\syswow64\\*") | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded Signed
  SignatureStatus OriginalFileName process_name dest EventCode ProcessId Hashes IMPHASH
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_unsigned_dll_side_loading_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: It is possible some Administrative utilities will load dismcore.dll
  outside of normal system paths, filter as needed.
