description: The following analytic detects the execution of sdbinst.exe with parameters
  indicative of silently creating a shim database. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent processes,
  and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because shim databases
  can be used to intercept and manipulate API calls, potentially allowing attackers
  to bypass security controls or achieve persistence. If confirmed malicious, this
  could enable unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access
  to the compromised system.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name = sdbinst.exe by Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `shim_database_installation_with_suspicious_parameters_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
