description: This search detects the process execution and arguments required to silently
  create a shim database.  The sdbinst.exe application is used to install shim database
  files (.sdb). A shim is a small library which transparently intercepts an API, changes
  the parameters passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation
  elsewhere.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
