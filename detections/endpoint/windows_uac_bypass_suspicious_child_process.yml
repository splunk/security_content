description: The following analytic detects when an executable known for User Account Control (UAC) bypass exploitation spawns a child process in a user-controlled location or a command shell executable (e.g., cmd.exe, powershell.exe). This detection leverages Sysmon EventID 1 data, focusing on high or system integrity level processes with specific parent-child process relationships. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attacker has successfully used a UAC bypass exploit to escalate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, potentially compromising the entire system.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2

how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest sysmon data, specifically Event ID 1 with process integrity level data.
known_false_positives: Including Werfault.exe may cause some unintended false positives related to normal application faulting, but is used in a number of UAC bypass techniques.
