description: The following analytic identifies when a new certificate is requested and/or granted against the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) using a Subject Alternative Name (SAN). This action by its self is not malicious, however improperly configured certificate templates can be abused to permit privilege escalation and environment compromise due to over permissive settings (AD CS ESC1)

how_to_implement: To implement this analytic, enhanced Audit Logging must be enabled on AD CS and within Group Policy Management for CS server. See Page 115 of first reference. Recommend throttle correlation by RequestId/ssl_serial at minimum.
known_false_positives: False positives may be generated in environments where administrative users or processes are allowed to generate certificates with Subject Alternative Names. Sources or templates used in these processes may need to be tuned out for accurate function.
