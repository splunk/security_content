- Endpoint
description: This search is to identify modification of registry to disable run application
  in window start menu. this application is known to be a helpful shortcut to windows
  OS user to run known application and also to execute some reg or batch script. This
  technique is used malware to make cleaning of its infection more harder by preventing
  known application run easily through run shortcut.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\NoRun"
  Registry.registry_value_data = "0x00000001" by Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name
  Registry.registry_value_data Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `disabling_norun_windows_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: admin may disable this application for non technical user.
