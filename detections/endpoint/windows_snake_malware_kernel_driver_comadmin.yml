description: The following analytic detects the creation of the comadmin.dat file in the %windows%\system32\Com directory, which is associated with Snake Malware. This detection leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem data model to identify file creation events matching the specified path and filename. This activity is significant because the comadmin.dat file is part of Snake Malware's installation process, which includes dropping a kernel driver and a custom DLL. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to load a malicious driver, potentially leading to privilege escalation and persistent access to the compromised system.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path="*\\windows\\system32\\com\\*" AND Filesystem.file_name="comadmin.dat"  by Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.process_id  Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_snake_malware_kernel_driver_comadmin_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
