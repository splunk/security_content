description: 'Adversaries may abuse Regsvr32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code.
  Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking
  and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems.
  Regsvr32.exe is also a Microsoft signed binary.This variation of the technique is
  often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" attack. \

  Upon investigating, look for network connections to remote destinations (internal
  or external). Be cautious to modify the query to look for "scrobj.dll", the ".dll"
  is not required to load scrobj. "scrobj.dll" will be loaded by "regsvr32.exe" upon
  execution. '
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` Processes.process=*scrobj*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives related to third party software registering
  .DLL's.
