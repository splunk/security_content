description: 'Adversaries may abuse Regsvr32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code.
  Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking
  and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems.
  Regsvr32.exe is also a Microsoft signed binary.This variation of the technique is
  often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" attack. \

  Upon investigating, look for network connections to remote destinations (internal
  or external). Be cautious to modify the query to look for "scrobj.dll", the ".dll"
  is not required to load scrobj. "scrobj.dll" will be loaded by "regsvr32.exe" upon
  execution. '
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_regsvr32` Processes.process=*scrobj*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_regsvr32_application_control_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives related to third party software registering
  .DLL's.
