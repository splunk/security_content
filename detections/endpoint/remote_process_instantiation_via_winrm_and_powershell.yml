description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with arguments
  utilized to start a process on a remote endpoint by abusing the WinRM protocol.
  Specifically, this search looks for the abuse of the `Invoke-Command` commandlet.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse WinRM and `powershell.exe` for lateral
  movement and remote code execution.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell` (Processes.process="*Invoke-Command*"
  AND Processes.process="*-ComputerName*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `remote_process_instantiation_via_winrm_and_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WinRM and `Invoke-Command` to start
  a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use cases. However,
  this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
