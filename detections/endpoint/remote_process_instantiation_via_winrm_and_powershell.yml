description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  arguments used to start a process on a remote endpoint via the WinRM protocol, specifically
  targeting the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process telemetry.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code
  execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to execute arbitrary code on remote systems, potentially leading to further compromise
  and lateral spread within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_powershell` (Processes.process="*Invoke-Command*"
  AND Processes.process="*-ComputerName*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `remote_process_instantiation_via_winrm_and_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WinRM and `Invoke-Command` to start
  a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use cases. However,
  this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.
