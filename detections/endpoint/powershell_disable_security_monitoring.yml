datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search is to identifies a modification in registry to disable the
  windows denfender real time behavior monitoring. This event or technique is commonly
  seen in RAT, bot, or Trojan to disable AV to evade detections.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN ("powershell.exe",
  "pwsh.exe", "sqlps.exe", "sqltoolsps.exe") Processes.process="*set-mppreference*"
  AND Processes.process IN ("*disablerealtimemonitoring*","*disableioavprotection*","*disableintrusionpreventionsystem*","*disablescriptscanning*","*disableblockatfirstseen*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `powershell_disable_security_monitoring_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives. However, tune based on scripts that
  may perform this action.
