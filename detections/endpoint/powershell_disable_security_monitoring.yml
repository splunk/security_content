description: The following analytic identifies attempts to disable Windows Defender
  real-time behavior monitoring via PowerShell commands. It detects the use of specific
  `Set-MpPreference` parameters that disable various security features. This activity
  is significant as it is commonly used by malware such as RATs, bots, or Trojans
  to evade detection by disabling antivirus protections. If confirmed malicious, this
  action could allow an attacker to operate undetected, leading to potential data
  exfiltration, further system compromise, or persistent access within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives. However, tune based on scripts that
  may perform this action.
