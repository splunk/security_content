status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects an unusual number of Kerberos Ticket Granting
  Ticket (TGT) requests for non-existing users from a single source endpoint. It leverages
  Event ID 4768 and identifies anomalies using the 3-sigma statistical rule. This
  behavior is significant as it may indicate an adversary performing a user enumeration
  attack against Active Directory. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could validate
  a list of usernames, potentially leading to further attacks such as brute force
  or credential stuffing, compromising the security of the environment.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4768
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4768 Status=0x6 TargetUserName!="*$" |
  bucket span=2m _time | stats dc(TargetUserName) AS unique_accounts values(TargetUserName)
  as tried_accounts by _time, src_ip | eventstats avg(unique_accounts) as comp_avg
  , stdev(unique_accounts) as comp_std by src_ip | eval upperBound=(comp_avg+comp_std*3)
  | eval isOutlier=if(unique_accounts > 10 and unique_accounts >= upperBound, 1, 0)
  | search isOutlier=1| `kerberos_user_enumeration_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited
  to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
