description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry entry "DisableRestrictedAdmin," which controls the Restricted Admin mode behavior. This detection leverages registry activity logs from endpoint data sources like Sysmon or Carbon Black. Monitoring this activity is crucial as changes to this setting can disable a security feature that limits credential exposure during remote connections. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could weaken security controls, increasing the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry WHERE (Registry.registry_path= "*\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\DisableRestrictedAdmin" Registry.registry_value_data = 0x00000000) BY _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_name Registry.registry_value_data Registry.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | where isnotnull(registry_value_data) | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_modify_registry_disable_restricted_admin_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes to the registry.
known_false_positives: Administrator may change this registry setting. Filter as needed.
