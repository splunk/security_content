description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry related to DisableRestrictedAdmin.
  This registry entry is used to control the behavior of Restricted Admin mode, which is a security feature that limits 
  the exposure of sensitive credentials when connecting remotely to another computer. When this registry value is set to 0 it 
  indicates that Restricted Admin mode is enabled (default behavior). As with any modifications to registry settings, 
  changing this entry should be approached cautiously, ensuring a clear understanding of the implications for system 
  security and functionality. Unauthorized changes to these security settings can pose risks and should be monitored 
  closely for any signs of tampering or unauthorized alterations.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: Administrator may change this registry setting. Filter as needed.
