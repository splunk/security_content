description: The following analytic identifies the use of `reg.exe` exporting Windows
  Registry hives containing credentials. Adversaries may use this technique to export
  registry hives for offline credential access attacks. Typically found executed from
  a untrusted process or script. Upon execution, a file will be written to disk.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_reg` (Processes.process=*save*
  OR Processes.process=*export*) AND (Processes.process="*\sam *" OR Processes.process="*\system
  *" OR Processes.process="*\security *") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible some agent based products will generate false
  positives. Filter as needed.
