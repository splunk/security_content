description: The following analytic detects the use of `reg.exe` to export Windows
  Registry hives, which may contain sensitive credentials. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  executions involving `save` or `export` actions targeting the `sam`, `system`, or
  `security` hives. This activity is significant as it indicates potential offline
  credential access attacks, often executed from untrusted processes or scripts. If
  confirmed malicious, attackers could gain access to credential data, enabling further
  compromise and lateral movement within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_reg` (Processes.process=*save*
  OR Processes.process=*export*) AND (Processes.process="*\sam *" OR Processes.process="*\system
  *" OR Processes.process="*\security *") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `extraction_of_registry_hives_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible some agent based products will generate false
  positives. Filter as needed.
