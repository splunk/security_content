- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies the use of `reg.exe` exporting Windows
  Registry hives containing credentials. Adversaries may use this technique to export
  registry hives for offline credential access attacks. Typically found executed from
  a untrusted process or script. Upon execution, a file will be written to disk.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_reg` (Processes.process=*save*
  OR Processes.process=*export*) AND (Processes.process="*\sam *" OR Processes.process="*\system
  *" OR Processes.process="*\security *") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `extraction_of_registry_hives_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: It is possible some agent based products will generate false
  positives. Filter as needed.
