description: The following analytic detects suspicious file access within the Discord LevelDB database. 
  This database contains critical data such as user profiles, messages, guilds, channels, settings, and cached information. 
  Access to this data poses a risk of Discord credential theft or unauthorized access to sensitive information on the 
  compromised system. Detecting such anomalies can serve as an effective pivot to identify non-Discord applications 
  accessing this database, potentially indicating the presence of malware or trojan stealers aimed at data theft.

  AND process_name != *\\discord.exe AND NOT (process_path IN ("*:\\Windows\\System32\\*", "*:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\*", "*:\\Program Files*", "*:\\Windows\\*"))

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
