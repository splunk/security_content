description: The following analytic detects non-Discord applications accessing the
  Discord LevelDB database. It leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically
  event code 4663, to identify file access attempts to the LevelDB directory by processes
  other than Discord. This activity is significant as it may indicate attempts to
  steal Discord credentials or access sensitive user data. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized access to user profiles, messages, and other critical
  information, potentially compromising the security and privacy of the affected users.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 object_file_path IN ("*\\discord\\Local
  Storage\\leveldb*") AND process_name != *\\discord.exe AND NOT (process_path IN
  ("*:\\Windows\\System32\\*", "*:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\*", "*:\\Program Files*", "*:\\Windows\\*"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by object_file_name
  object_file_path process_name process_path  process_id EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_non_discord_app_access_discord_leveldb_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
