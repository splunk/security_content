description: The following analytic detects the execution of 7z or 7za processes with
  command lines pointing to SMB network shares. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to archive and exfiltrate
  sensitive files to a network share, a technique observed in CONTI LEAK tools. If
  confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to data exfiltration, compromising
  sensitive information and potentially aiding further attacks.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
