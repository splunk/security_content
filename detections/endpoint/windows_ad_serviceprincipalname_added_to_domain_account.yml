description: The following analytic identifies the addition of a Service Principal Name to a domain account. While this event may be part of a legitimate action part of certain administrative operations,
  it may also be evidence of a persistence attack. Domain accounts with Servce Principal Names are vulnerable to a technique called Kerberoasting that enables attackers to potentially obtain the cleartext password 
  of the account by performing offline cracking. An adversary who has obtained privileged access to a domain environment may add an SPN to a privileged account to then leverage the Kerberoasting technique and attempt
  to obtain its clertext password.

  | `windows_ad_serviceprincipalname_added_to_domain_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting eventcode 
 `5136`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes` 
 within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. Additionally, a SACL needs to be created for AD objects in order to ingest attribute modifications.
known_false_positives: A Service Principal Name should only be added to an account when an application requires it. While infrequent, this detection may trigger on 
  legitimate actions. Filter as needed.
