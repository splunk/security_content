description: The following analytic detects the addition of a Service Principal Name
  (SPN) to a domain account. It leverages Windows Event Code 5136 and monitors changes
  to the servicePrincipalName attribute. This activity is significant because it may
  indicate an attempt to perform Kerberoasting, a technique where attackers extract
  and crack service account passwords offline. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow an attacker to obtain cleartext passwords, leading to unauthorized access
  and potential lateral movement within the domain environment.
search: >-

  | stats values(ObjectDN) as ObjectDN by _time, Computer, SubjectUserName, AttributeValue

  | `windows_ad_serviceprincipalname_added_to_domain_account_filter`
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting eventcode
  `5136`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes`
  within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. Additionally, a SACL needs to be created
  for AD objects in order to ingest attribute modifications.
known_false_positives: A Service Principal Name should only be added to an account
  when an application requires it. While infrequent, this detection may trigger on
  legitimate actions. Filter as needed.
