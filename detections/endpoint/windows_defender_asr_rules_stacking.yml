description: The following analytic identifies security events from Microsoft Defender,
  focusing on Exploit Guard and Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) features. It detects
  Event IDs 1121, 1126, 1131, and 1133 for blocked operations, and Event IDs 1122,
  1125, 1132, and 1134 for audit logs. Event ID 1129 indicates user overrides, while
  Event ID 5007 signals configuration changes. This detection uses a lookup to correlate
  ASR rule GUIDs with descriptive names. Monitoring these events is crucial for identifying
  unauthorized operations, potential security breaches, and policy enforcement issues.
  If confirmed malicious, attackers could bypass security measures, execute unauthorized
  actions, or alter system configurations.

how_to_implement: The following analytic requires collection of Windows Defender Operational
  logs in either XML or multi-line. To collect, setup a new input for the Windows
  Defender Operational logs. In addition, it does require a lookup that maps the ID
  to ASR Rule name. Note that Audit and block Event IDs have different fields, therefore
  the analytic will need to be modified for each type of event. The analytic can be
  modified to look for specific ASR rules, or to look for specific Event IDs. EventID
  5007 is a change in the registry, and may be a false positive. This can be removed
  from the search if desired.
known_false_positives: False positives are not expected with this analytic, since
  it is a hunting analytic. It is meant to show the use of ASR rules and how they
  can be used to detect malicious activity.
