description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves dns reply information using Windows OS built-in tool IPConfig. 
  This technique is being abused by threat actors, adversaries and post exploitation tools like WINPEAS to retrieve DNS information for the targeted host. 
  This IPConfig parameter (/displaydns) can show dns server resource record, record name, record type, time to live data length and dns reply.
  This hunting detection can be a good pivot to check which process is executing this command line in specific host system that may lead to malware or adversaries 
  gathering network information.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name="ipconfig.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name = "ipconfig.exe" AND Processes.process = "*/displaydns*"
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid 
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_system_network_config_discovery_display_dns_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
