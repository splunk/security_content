description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves
  dns reply information using Windows OS built-in tool IPConfig. This technique is
  being abused by threat actors, adversaries and post exploitation tools like WINPEAS
  to retrieve DNS information for the targeted host. This IPConfig parameter (/displaydns)
  can show dns server resource record, record name, record type, time to live data
  length and dns reply. This hunting detection can be a good pivot to check which
  process is executing this command line in specific host system that may lead to
  malware or adversaries gathering network information.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="ipconfig.exe"
  OR Processes.original_file_name = "ipconfig.exe" AND Processes.process = "*/displaydns*"
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_system_network_config_discovery_display_dns_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
