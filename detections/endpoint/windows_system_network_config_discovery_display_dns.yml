description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the "ipconfig /displaydns"
  command, which retrieves DNS reply information using the built-in Windows tool IPConfig.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process command-line executions. Monitoring this activity is significant
  as threat actors and post-exploitation tools like WINPEAS often abuse this command
  to gather network information. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
  attackers to map the network, identify DNS servers, and potentially facilitate further
  network-based attacks or lateral movement.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="ipconfig.exe"
  OR Processes.original_file_name = "ipconfig.exe" AND Processes.process = "*/displaydns*"

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
