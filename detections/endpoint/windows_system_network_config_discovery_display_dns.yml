description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves
  dns reply information using Windows OS built-in tool IPConfig. This technique is
  being abused by threat actors, adversaries and post exploitation tools like WINPEAS
  to retrieve DNS information for the targeted host. This IPConfig parameter (/displaydns)
  can show dns server resource record, record name, record type, time to live data
  length and dns reply. This hunting detection can be a good pivot to check which
  process is executing this command line in specific host system that may lead to
  malware or adversaries gathering network information.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="ipconfig.exe"
  OR Processes.original_file_name = "ipconfig.exe" AND Processes.process = "*/displaydns*"
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_system_network_config_discovery_display_dns_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
