- Endpoint
description: This search is to detect file creation in remcos folder in appdata which
  is the keylog and clipboard logs that will be send to its c2 server. This is really
  a good TTP indicator that there is a remcos rat in the system that do keylogging,
  clipboard grabbing and audio recording.
search: '|tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_name IN ("*.dat")
  Filesystem.file_path = "*\\remcos\\*" by _time Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path
  Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remcos_rat_file_creation_in_remcos_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
