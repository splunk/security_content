description: The following analytic identifies instances where four or more distinct
  detection analytics are associated with malicious command line behavior on a specific
  host. This detection leverages the Command Line Interface (CLI) data from various
  sources to identify suspicious activities. This behavior is significant as it often
  indicates attempts to execute malicious commands, access sensitive data, install
  backdoors, or perform other nefarious actions. If confirmed malicious, attackers
  could gain unauthorized control, exfiltrate information, escalate privileges, or
  launch further attacks within the network, leading to severe compromise.

how_to_implement: Splunk Enterprise Security is required to utilize this correlation.
  In addition, modify the source_count value to your environment. In our testing,
  a count of 4 or 5 was decent in a lab, but the number may need to be increased base
  on internal testing. In addition, based on false positives, modify any analytics
  to be anomaly and lower or increase risk based on organization importance.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on many factors. Tune
  the correlation as needed to reduce too many triggers.
