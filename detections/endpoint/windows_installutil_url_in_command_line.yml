description: 'The following analytic identifies the Windows InstallUtil.exe binary
  passing a HTTP request on the command-line. This technique may be used to download
  and execute code while bypassing application control. \

  When `InstallUtil.exe` is used in a malicous manner, the path to an executable on
  the filesystem is typically specified. Take note of the parent process. In a suspicious
  instance, this will be spawned from a non-standard process like `Cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`
  or `Explorer.exe`. \

  If used by a developer, typically this will be found with multiple command-line
  switches/arguments and spawn from Visual Studio. \

  During triage review resulting network connections, file modifications, and parallel
  processes. Capture any artifacts and review further.'

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives should be present as InstallUtil is
  not typically used to download remote files. Filter as needed based on Developers
  requirements.
