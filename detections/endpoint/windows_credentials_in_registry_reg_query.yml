name: Windows Credentials in Registry Reg Query

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a process command line related to the
  discovery of possible password or credentials in the registry. This technique is
  being abused by adversaries or post exploitation tools like winpeas to steal credentials
  in the registry in the targeted host. Registry can contain several sensitive information
  like username and credentials that can be used for privilege escalation, persistence
  or even in lateral movement. This Anomaly detection can be a good pivot to detect
  a suspicious process querying a registry related to password or private keys.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
