description: This search is to detect a suspicious excessive usage of sc.exe in a
  host machine. This technique was seen in several ransomware , xmrig and other malware
  to create, modify, delete or disable a service may related to security application
  or to gain privilege escalation.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode = 1 process_name = "sc.exe" |  bucket _time span=15m |
  stats values(process) as process count as numScExe by Computer, _time |  eventstats
  avg(numScExe) as avgScExe, stdev(numScExe) as stdScExe, count as numSlots by Computer
  |  eval upperThreshold=(avgScExe + stdScExe *3) |  eval isOutlier=if(avgScExe >
  5 and avgScExe >= upperThreshold, 1, 0) |  search isOutlier=1 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_usage_of_sc_service_utility_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed taskkill.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: excessive execution of sc.exe is quite suspicious since it
  can modify or execute app in high privilege permission.
