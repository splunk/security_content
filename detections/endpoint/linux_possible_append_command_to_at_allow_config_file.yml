type: Anomaly
description: 'The following analytic is designed to identify suspicious command lines
  that may append user entries to either /etc/at.allow or /etc/at.deny. These files
  can be exploited by malicious actors for persistence on a compromised Linux host
  by altering permissions for scheduled tasks using the at command.

  In this context, an attacker can create a user or add an existing user to these
  configuration files to execute their malicious code through scheduled tasks. The
  detection of such anomalous behavior can serve as an effective indicator warranting
  further investigation to validate if the activity is indeed malicious or a false
  positive.'
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process = "*echo*" AND Processes.process IN("*/etc/at.allow", "*/etc/at.deny")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_possible_append_command_to_at_allow_config_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this commandline
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
