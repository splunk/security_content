description: The following analytic identifies a computer account creating a new computer
  account with a specific Service Principal Name (SPN) "RestrictedKrbHost". This detection
  leverages Windows Security Event Logs, specifically EventCode 4741, to identify
  such activities. This behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to establish
  unauthorized Kerberos authentication channels, potentially leading to lateral movement
  or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker
  to impersonate services, access sensitive information, or maintain persistence within
  the network.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4741
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4741 user_type=computer SubjectDomainName!="NT
  AUTHORITY" ServicePrincipalNames=*RestrictedKrbHost* | stats  count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, subject, action ,src_user, user, user_type,
  SubjectUserName,SubjectDomainName | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_computer_account_created_by_computer_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4741 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: It is possible third party applications may have a computer
  account that adds computer accounts, filtering may be required.
