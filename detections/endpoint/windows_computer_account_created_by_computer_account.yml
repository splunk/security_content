description: The following analytic identifes a Computer Account creating a new Computer
  Account with specific a Service Principle Name - "RestrictedKrbHost". The RestrictedKrbHost
  service class allows client applications to use Kerberos authentication when they
  do not have the identity of the service but have the server name.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4741
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4741 user_type=computer SubjectDomainName!="NT AUTHORITY" ServicePrincipalNames=*RestrictedKrbHost* 
  | stats  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, subject, action ,src_user, user, user_type, SubjectUserName,SubjectDomainName 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_computer_account_created_by_computer_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4741 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: It is possible third party applications may have a computer
  account that adds computer accounts, filtering may be required.
