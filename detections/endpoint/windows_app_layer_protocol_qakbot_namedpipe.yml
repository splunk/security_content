status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process creating or connecting
  to a possible Qakbot named pipe . This technique was seen in Qakbot malware that
  creates named pipe after injecting its code in legitimate process to communicate
  on other process that also has an injected code to steal information on the compromised
  host. This Anomaly detection can be a good pivot for possible Qakbot infection.
  This detection looks for possible random generated named pipe (in GUID form) created
  by known process being abused by Qakbot.

  "*\\wermgr.exe", "*\\ping.exe", "*\\OneDriveSetup.exe", "*\\dxdiag.exe", "*\\mobsync.exe",

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, pipename, processguid and named pipe event type from
  your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of
  the Sysmon TA.
