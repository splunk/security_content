description: The following analytic detects a suspicious process creating or connecting
  to a potential Qakbot named pipe. It leverages Sysmon EventCodes 17 and 18, focusing
  on specific processes known to be abused by Qakbot and identifying randomly generated
  named pipes in GUID form. This activity is significant as Qakbot malware uses named
  pipes for inter-process communication after code injection, facilitating data theft.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate a Qakbot infection, leading
  to unauthorized data access and potential exfiltration from the compromised host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 17
- Sysmon EventID 18
search: '`sysmon` EventCode IN (17, 18) EventType IN ( "CreatePipe", "ConnectPipe")
  Image IN ("*\\calc.exe", "*\\notepad.exe", "*\\rdpclip.exe", "*\\explorer.exe",
  "*\\wermgr.exe", "*\\ping.exe", "*\\OneDriveSetup.exe", "*\\dxdiag.exe", "*\\mobsync.exe",
  "*\\msra.exe", "*\\xwizard.exe") | regex PipeName="^\\\{[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{8}"
  | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Image EventType
  ProcessGuid ProcessId PipeName SecurityID EventCode dest UserID | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_app_layer_protocol_qakbot_namedpipe_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, pipename, processguid and named pipe event type from
  your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of
  the Sysmon TA.
