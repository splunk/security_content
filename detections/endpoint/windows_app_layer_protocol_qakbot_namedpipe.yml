description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process creating or connecting to a possible Qakbot named pipe .
  This technique was seen in Qakbot malware that creates named pipe after injecting its code in legitimate process to communicate 
  on other process that also has an injected code to steal information on the compromised host. This Anomaly detection can be a 
  good pivot for possible Qakbot infection. This detection looks for possible random generated named pipe (in GUID form) created by known process 
  being abused by Qakbot.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, pipename, processguid and named pipe event type from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
