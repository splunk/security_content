description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments that use PowerShell environment variables to identify the
  current logged user. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is
  significant as adversaries may use it for situational awareness and Active Directory
  discovery on compromised endpoints. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
  allow attackers to gather critical user information, aiding in further exploitation
  and lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
