description: This search looks for processes launching netsh.exe. Netsh is a command-line
  scripting utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify
  the network configuration of a computer that is currently running. Netsh can be
  used as a persistence proxy technique to execute a helper DLL when netsh.exe is
  executed. In this search, we are looking for processes spawned by netsh.exe and
  executing commands via the command line.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
id: b89919ed-fe5f-492c-b139-95dbb162040e
known_false_positives: Some VPN applications are known to launch netsh.exe. Outside
  of these instances, it is unusual for an executable to launch netsh.exe and run
  commands.
