description: This search looks for processes launching netsh.exe. Netsh is a command-line
  scripting utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify
  the network configuration of a computer that is currently running. Netsh can be
  used as a persistence proxy technique to execute a helper DLL when netsh.exe is
  executed. In this search, we are looking for processes spawned by netsh.exe and
  executing commands via the command line.

- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  AS Processes.process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_netsh` by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some VPN applications are known to launch netsh.exe. Outside
  of these instances, it is unusual for an executable to launch netsh.exe and run
  commands.
