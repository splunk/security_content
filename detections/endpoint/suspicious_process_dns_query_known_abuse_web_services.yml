description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious process having a dns query on
  known abuse text paste web services, or VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution
  platform to download some files. This technique is abused by adversaries, malware
  attacker and red team to download a malicious file on the target host. This is a
  good TTP indicator for possible initial access technique. Noise and false positive
  can be seen if the following instant messaging is allowed or common application
  in corporate network.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*pastebin*", "*discord*", "*telegram*",
  "*t.me*") process_name IN ("cmd.exe", "*powershell*", "pwsh.exe", "wscript.exe",
  "cscript.exe") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image
  QueryName QueryStatus process_name QueryResults Computer | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `suspicious_process_dns_query_known_abuse_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: his detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 7, Driver
  loaded. Please tune your sysmon config that you DriverLoad event for SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll
  is captured by Sysmon. Additionally, you need sysmon logs for Event ID 22, DNS Query.
  We suggest to run this detection at least once a day over the last 14 days.
known_false_positives: Noise and false positive can be seen if the following instant
  messaging is allowed to use within corporate network. filter is needed.
