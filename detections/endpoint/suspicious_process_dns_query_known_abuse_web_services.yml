description: The following analytic detects a suspicious process making a DNS query via known,
  abused text-paste web services, VoIP, instant messaging, and digital distribution
  platforms used to download external files. This technique is abused by adversaries,
  malware actors, and red teams to download a malicious file on the target host. This
  is a good TTP indicator for possible initial access techniques. A user will experience
  false positives if the following instant messaging is allowed or common applications
  like telegram or discord are allowed in the corporate network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*pastebin*", "*discord*", "*api.telegram*","*t.me*") 
  process_name IN ("cmd.exe", "*powershell*", "pwsh.exe", "wscript.exe","cscript.exe") OR Image IN ("*\\users\\public\\*", "*\\programdata\\*", "*\\temp\\*", "*\\Windows\\Tasks\\*", "*\\appdata\\*", "*\\perflogs\\*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName QueryStatus process_name QueryResults Computer 
  | rename Computer as dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_process_dns_query_known_abuse_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 22, DNS Query.
  We suggest you run this detection at least once a day over the last 14 days.
known_false_positives: Noise and false positive can be seen if the following instant
  messaging is allowed to use within corporate network. In this case, a filter is
  needed.
