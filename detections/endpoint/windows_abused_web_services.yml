- Sysmon EventID 22
description: The following analytic detects a suspicious process making DNS queries
  to known, abused web services such as text-paste sites, VoIP, secure tunneling,
  instant messaging, and digital distribution platforms. This detection leverages
  Sysmon logs with Event ID 22, focusing on specific query names. This activity is
  significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to download malicious files,
  a common initial access technique. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the target host.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*pastebin*",""*textbin*"", "*ngrok.io*",
  "*discord*", "*duckdns.org*", "*pasteio.com*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName QueryStatus process_name QueryResults
  Computer | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_abused_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 22, DNS Query.
  We suggest you run this detection at least once a day over the last 14 days.
known_false_positives: Noise and false positive can be seen if the following instant
  messaging is allowed to use within corporate network. In this case, a filter is
  needed.
