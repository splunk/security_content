name: Excessive File Deletion In WinDefender Folder

status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects excessive file deletion events in the
  Windows Defender folder. It leverages Sysmon EventCodes 23 and 26 to identify processes
  deleting multiple files within this directory. This behavior is significant as it
  may indicate an attempt to corrupt or disable Windows Defender, a key security component.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to disable endpoint
  protection, facilitating further malicious actions without detection.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 23 
- Sysmon EventID 26
search: '`sysmon` EventCode IN ("23","26") TargetFilename = "*\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows
  Defender\\*" | stats count, values(TargetFilename) as deleted_files, min(_time)
  as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime by user, dest, signature, signature_id, Image,
  process_name, process_guid | rename Image as process | where count >=50 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_file_deletion_in_windefender_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest logs that
  include the process name, TargetFilename, and ProcessID executions from your endpoints.
  If you are utilizing Sysmon, ensure you have at least version 2.0 of the Sysmon
  TA installed.
known_false_positives: Windows Defender AV updates may trigger this alert. Please
  adjust the filter macros to mitigate false positives.
