description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  the `Get-NetTcpConnection` command, which lists current TCP connections on a system.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and command-line executions. Monitoring this activity
  is significant as it may indicate an adversary or Red Team performing network reconnaissance
  or situational awareness. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to map network connections, aiding in lateral movement or further exploitation within
  the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="powershell.exe")
  (Processes.process=*Get-NetTcpConnection*) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
