description: The following analytic detects the execution of a suspicious rundll32 command line used to clear the shim cache. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because clearing the shim cache is an anti-forensic technique aimed at evading detection and removing forensic artifacts. If confirmed malicious, this action could hinder incident response efforts, allowing an attacker to cover their tracks and maintain persistence on the compromised machine.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
