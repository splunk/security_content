description: The following analytic identifies modifications to the SafeBoot registry
  keys, specifically within the Minimal and Network paths. This detection leverages
  registry activity logs from endpoint data sources like Sysmon or EDR tools. Monitoring
  these keys is crucial as adversaries can use them to persist drivers or services
  in Safe Mode, with Network allowing network connections. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could enable attackers to maintain persistence even in Safe Mode,
  potentially bypassing certain security measures and facilitating further malicious
  actions.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  where Registry.registry_path IN ("*SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Minimal\\*","*SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Network\\*")
  by _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: updated windows application needed in safe boot may used this
