description: The following analytic identifies a modification or registry add to the
  safeboot registry as an autostart mechanism. This technique is utilized by adversaries
  to persist a driver or service into Safe Mode. Two keys are monitored in this analytic,  Minimal
  and Network. adding values to Minimal will load into Safe Mode and by adding into
  Network it will provide the service or drive the ability to perform network connections
  in Safe Mode.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 12
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  where Registry.registry_path IN ("*SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Minimal\\*","*SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Network\\*")
  by _time span=1h Registry.dest Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_name
  Registry.process_guid Registry.registry_key_name Registry.registry_value_data |

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_registry_modification_for_safe_mode_persistence_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: updated windows application needed in safe boot may used this
  registry
