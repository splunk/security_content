description: The following analytic detects the addition of permissions required for
  a DCSync attack, specifically DS-Replication-Get-Changes, DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All,
  and DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set. It leverages EventCode 5136 from
  the Windows Security Event Log to identify when these permissions are granted. This
  activity is significant because it indicates potential preparation for a DCSync
  attack, which can be used to replicate AD objects and exfiltrate sensitive data.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain extensive access to Active Directory,
  leading to severe data breaches and privilege escalation.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  the eventcode 5136. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory
  Services Changes` within `DS Access` needs to be enabled, alongside a SACL for `everybody`
  to  `Write All Properties` applied to the domain root and all descendant objects.
  Once the necessary logging has been enabled, enumerate the domain policy to verify
  if existing accounts with access need to be whitelisted, or revoked. Assets and
  Identities is also leveraged to automatically translate the objectSid into username.
  Ensure your identities lookup is configured with the sAMAccountName and objectSid
  of all AD user and computer objects.
known_false_positives: When there is a change to nTSecurityDescriptor, Windows logs
  the entire ACL with the newly added components. If existing accounts are present
  with this permission, they will raise an alert each time the nTSecurityDescriptor
  is updated unless whitelisted.
