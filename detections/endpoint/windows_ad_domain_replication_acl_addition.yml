description:
  The following analytic detects the addition of the permissions necessary to perform a DCSync attack.
  In order to replicate AD objects, the initiating user or computer must have the following permissions on the domain.
  - DS-Replication-Get-Changes
  - DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All
  Certain Sync operations may require the additional permission of DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set.
  By default, adding DCSync permissions via the Powerview Add-ObjectACL operation adds all 3. This alert identifies where this trifecta has been met, and also where just the base level requirements have been met.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting the eventcode 5136. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Directory Services Changes` within `DS Access` needs to be enabled, alongside a SACL for `everybody` to  `Write All Properties`
  applied to the domain root and all descendant objects. Once the necessary logging has been enabled, enumerate the domain policy to verify if existing
  accounts with access need to be whitelisted, or revoked. Assets and Identities is also leveraged to automatically translate the objectSid into username.
  Ensure your identities lookup is configured with the sAMAccountName and objectSid of all AD user and computer objects.
known_false_positives:
  When there is a change to nTSecurityDescriptor, Windows logs the entire ACL with the newly added components.
  If existing accounts are present with this permission, they will raise an alert each time the nTSecurityDescriptor is updated unless whitelisted.
