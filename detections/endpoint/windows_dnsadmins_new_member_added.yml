description: The following analytic leverages Event ID 4732 to identify the addition of a new member to the DnsAdmins group within Active Directory. . Members of the DnsAdmin group can manage
  the DNS service which most of the times runs on the Domain Controller. By abusing legitimate DNS management functionality, a member of the DnsAdmins group can escalate privileges by
  executing malicious code on a Domain Controller as SYSTEM. Security teams should monitor the modification of the DnsAdmins group and validate the changes are legitimate.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4732 TargetUserName=DnsAdmins | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(TargetUserName) as target_users_added values(user) as user by  dest src_user 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_dnsadmins_new_member_added_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, Domain Controller events need to be ingested. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Security Group Management`
  within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: New members can be added to the DnsAdmins group as part of legitimate administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
