description: The following analytic detects the addition of a new member to the DnsAdmins
  group in Active Directory by leveraging Event ID 4732. This detection uses security
  event logs to identify changes to this high-privilege group. Monitoring this activity
  is crucial because members of the DnsAdmins group can manage the DNS service, often
  running on Domain Controllers, and potentially execute malicious code with SYSTEM
  privileges. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to escalate
  privileges and gain control over critical domain services, posing a significant
  security risk.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4732 TargetUserName=DnsAdmins | stats min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(TargetUserName) as target_users_added
  values(user) as user by  dest src_user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_dnsadmins_new_member_added_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, Domain Controller events
  need to be ingested. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Security
  Group Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: New members can be added to the DnsAdmins group as part of
  legitimate administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
