description: 'The following analytic identifies a source process name failing to authenticate
  with multiple users. This behavior could represent an adversary performing a Password
  Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment to obtain initial access
  or elevate privileges. Event 4625 generates on domain controllers, member servers,
  and workstations when an account fails to logon. Logon Type 2 describes an iteractive
  logon attempt.

  The detection calculates the standard deviation for each host and leverages the
  3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number of users. To customize this
  analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket` span time and the
  calculation of the `upperBound` field. This logic can be used for real time security
  monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.

  This detection will trigger on the potenfially malicious host, perhaps controlled
  via a trojan or operated by an insider threat, from where a password spraying attack
  is being executed. This could be a domain controller as well as a member server
  or workstation.

  The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by
  providing fields like source process name, source account and attempted user accounts.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers aas well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A process failing to authenticate with multiple users is not
  a common behavior for legitimate user sessions. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
