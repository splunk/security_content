description: 'The following analytic identifies new printer drivers being load by
  utilizing the Windows PrintService operational logs, EventCode 316. This was identified
  during our testing of CVE-2021-34527 previously (CVE-2021-1675) or PrintNightmare.
  \

  Within the proof of concept code, the following event will occur - "Printer driver
  1234 for Windows x64 Version-3 was added or updated. Files:- UNIDRV.DLL, kernelbase.dll,
  evil.dll. No user action is required." \

  During triage, isolate the endpoint and review for source of exploitation. Capture
  any additional file modification events and review the source of where the exploitation
  began.'

  Message | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `print_spooler_adding_a_printer_driver_filter`'
how_to_implement: You will need to ensure PrintService Admin and Operational logs
  are being logged to Splunk from critical or all systems.
known_false_positives: Unknown. This may require filtering.
