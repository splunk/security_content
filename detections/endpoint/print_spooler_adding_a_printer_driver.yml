description: 'The following analytic identifies new printer drivers being load by utilizing the Windows PrintService operational logs, EventCode 316. This was identified during our testing of CVE-2021-1675 or PrintNightmare. \
  
  Within the proof of concept code, the following event will occur - "Printer driver 1234 for Windows x64 Version-3 was added or updated. Files:- UNIDRV.DLL, kernelbase.dll, evil.dll. No user action is required." \

  During triage, isolate the endpoint and review for source of exploitation. Capture any additional file modification events and review the source of where the exploitation began.'

how_to_implement: You will need to ensure PrintService Admin and Operational logs are being logged to Splunk from critical or all systems. 
known_false_positives: Unknown. This may require filtering.
