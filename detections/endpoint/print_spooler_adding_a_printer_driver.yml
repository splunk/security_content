type: TTP
description: 'The following analytic detects the addition of new printer drivers by
  monitoring Windows PrintService operational logs, specifically EventCode 316. This
  detection leverages log data to identify messages indicating the addition or update
  of printer drivers, such as "kernelbase.dll" and "UNIDRV.DLL." This activity is
  significant as it may indicate exploitation attempts related to vulnerabilities
  like CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare). If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain
  code execution or escalate privileges, potentially compromising the affected system.
  Immediate isolation and investigation of the endpoint are recommended.'
data_source:

  = "*kernelbase.dll,*" Message = "*UNIDRV.DLL,*" Message = "*.DLL.*" | stats  count

how_to_implement: You will need to ensure PrintService Admin and Operational logs
  are being logged to Splunk from critical or all systems.
known_false_positives: Unknown. This may require filtering.
