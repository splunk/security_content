description: The following analytic identifies potential privilege escalation activities
  within an organization's Active Directory (AD) environment. It detects this activity
  by correlating multiple analytics from the Active Directory Privilege Escalation
  analytic story within a specified time frame. This is significant for a SOC as it
  helps identify coordinated attempts to gain elevated privileges, which could indicate
  a serious security threat. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data, leading to potential
  data breaches and further compromise of the network.

how_to_implement: Splunk Enterprise Security is required to utilize this correlation.
  In addition, modify the source_count value to your environment. In our testing,
  a count of 4 or 5 was decent in a lab, but the number may need to be increased as
  the analytic story includes over 30 analytics. In addition, based on false positives,
  modify any analytics to be anomaly and lower or increase risk based on organization
  importance.
known_false_positives: False positives will most likely be present based on risk scoring
  and how the organization handles system to system communication. Filter, or modify
  as needed. In addition to count by analytics, adding a risk score may be useful.
  In our testing, with 22 events over 30 days, the risk scores ranged from 500 to
  80,000. Your organization will be different, monitor and modify as needed.
