description: This analytic detects a potential process using COM Object like CMLUA
  or CMSTPLUA to bypass UAC. This technique has been used by ransomware adversaries
  to gain administrative privileges to its running process.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  ImageLoaded IN ("*\\CMLUA.dll", "*\\CMSTPLUA.dll",
  "*\\CMLUAUTIL.dll") NOT(process_name IN("CMSTP.exe", "CMMGR32.exe")) NOT(Image IN("*\\windows\\*",
  "*\\program files*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by Image ImageLoaded process_name Computer EventCode Signed ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `cmlua_or_cmstplua_uac_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Legitimate windows application that are not on the list loading
  this dll. Filter as needed.
