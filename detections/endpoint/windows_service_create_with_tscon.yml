description: The following analytic detects potential RDP Hijacking attempts by monitoring
  a series of actions taken by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a remote
  system. The attacker first runs the quser command to query the remote host for disconnected
  user sessions. Upon identifying a disconnected session, they use the sc.exe command
  to create a new Windows service with a binary path that launches tscon.exe. By specifying
  the disconnected session ID and a destination ID, the attacker can transfer the
  disconnected session to a new RDP session, effectively hijacking the user's session.
  This analytic allows security teams to detect and respond to RDP Hijacking attempts,
  mitigating potential risks and impacts on targeted systems.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=sc.exe
  Processes.process="*/dest:rdp-tcp*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_service_create_with_tscon_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may arise in the RDP Hijacking analytic when
  legitimate administrators access remote sessions for maintenance or troubleshooting
  purposes. These activities might resemble an attacker''s attempt to hijack a disconnected
  session, leading to false alarms. To mitigate the risk of false positives and improve
  the overall security posture, organizations can implement Group Policy to automatically
  disconnect RDP sessions when they are complete. By enforcing this policy, administrators
  ensure that disconnected sessions are promptly terminated, reducing the window of
  opportunity for an attacker to hijack a session. Additionally, organizations can
  also implement access control mechanisms and monitor the behavior of privileged
  accounts to further enhance security and reduce the chances of false positives in
  RDP Hijacking detection.
