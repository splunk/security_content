name: Windows High File Deletion Frequency

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: This search identifies a high frequency of file deletions relative to the process
  name and process ID. Such events typically occur when ransomware attempts to encrypt
  files with specific extensions, leading Sysmon to treat the original files
  as deleted as soon as they are replaced with encrypted data.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 23
- Sysmon Event ID 26
search: '`sysmon` EventCode IN ("23","26") TargetFilename IN ("*.cmd", "*.ini","*.gif", "*.jpg", "*.jpeg", "*.db", "*.ps1", "*.doc", "*.docx", "*.xls", "*.xlsx", "*.ppt", "*.pptx", "*.bmp","*.zip", "*.rar", "*.7z", "*.chm", "*.png", "*.log", "*.vbs", "*.js", "*.vhd", "*.bak", "*.wbcat", "*.bkf" , "*.backup*", "*.dsk", "*.win") NOT TargetFilename IN ("*\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\*")
  | stats count, values(TargetFilename) as deleted_files, min(_time) as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime by user, dest, signature, signature_id, Image, process_name, process_guid
  | rename Image as process 
  | where count >=100 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_high_file_deletion_frequency_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to ingest logs that include the deleted target file name, process name, and process ID from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, ensure you have at least version 2.0 of the Sysmon TA installed.
known_false_positives: Users may delete a large number of pictures or files in a folder, which could trigger this detection. Additionally, heavy usage of PowerBI and Outlook may also result in false positives.
