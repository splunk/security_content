description: The following analytic detects attempts to dump the LSASS process memory,
  a common technique in credential dumping attacks. It leverages Sysmon logs, specifically
  EventCode 10, to identify suspicious call traces to dbgcore.dll and dbghelp.dll
  associated with lsass.exe. This activity is significant as it often precedes the
  theft of sensitive login credentials, posing a high risk of unauthorized access
  to systems and data. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain access to critical
  credentials, enabling further compromise and lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe CallTrace=*dbgcore.dll* OR CallTrace=*dbghelp.dll*
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, TargetImage,
  TargetProcessId, SourceImage, SourceProcessId  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `access_lsass_memory_for_dump_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requires Sysmon Logs and a Sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 10 for lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: Administrators can create memory dumps for debugging purposes,
  but memory dumps of the LSASS process would be unusual.

  message: process $SourceImage$ injected into $TargetImage$ and was attempted dump
    LSASS on $dest$. Adversaries tend to do this when trying to accesss credential
    material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem
    Service (LSASS).
