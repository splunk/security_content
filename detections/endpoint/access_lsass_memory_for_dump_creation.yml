description: Detect memory dumping of the LSASS process.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe CallTrace=*dbgcore.dll* OR CallTrace=*dbghelp.dll*
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, TargetImage,
  TargetProcessId, SourceImage, SourceProcessId | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `access_lsass_memory_for_dump_creation_filter` '
how_to_implement: This search requires Sysmon Logs and a Sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 10 for lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: Administrators can create memory dumps for debugging purposes,
  but memory dumps of the LSASS process would be unusual.
