description: The following analytic identifies a default behavior of a MetaSploit
  payload. MetaSploit uses Apache Benchmark to generate payloads. The payloads contain
  standard artifacts including "Apache Benchmark" and the original file name is always
  ab.exe. During triage, review the process and it's path. It is possible network
  connections spawned from it. Review parallel processes for further behaviors.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.original_file_name=ab.exe
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_apache_benchmark_binary_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as there is a small subset
  of binaries that contain the original file name of ab.exe. Filter as needed.
