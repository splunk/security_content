description: The following analytic detects the use of the PowerShell cmdlet `export-pfxcertificate`
  on the command line, indicating an attempt to export a certificate from the local
  Windows Certificate Store. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to exfiltrate authentication
  certificates, which can be used to impersonate users or decrypt sensitive data.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access and potential data
  breaches.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*export-pfxcertificate*"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_steal_authentication_certificates_export_pfxcertificate_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Filtering may be requried based on automated utilities and
  third party applications that may export certificates.
