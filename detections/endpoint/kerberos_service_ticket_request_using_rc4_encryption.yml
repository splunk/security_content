description:  The following analytic leverages Kerberos Event 4769, A Kerberos service
  ticket was requested, to identify a potential Kerberos Service Ticket request related to a Golden Ticket attack. Adversaries who have obtained the Krbtgt account NTLM password 
  hash may forge a Kerberos Granting Ticket (TGT) to obtain unrestricted access to an Active Directory environment. Armed with a Golden Ticket, attackers can request 
  service tickets to move laterally and execute code on remote systems. Looking for Kerberos Service Ticket requests using the legacy RC4 encryption mechanism could represent the second stage
  of a Golden Ticket attack. RC4 usage should be rare on a modern network since Windows Vista & Windows Sever 2008 and newer support AES Kerberos encryption.\
  Defenders should note that if an attacker does not leverage the NTLM password hash but rather the AES key to create a golden ticket, this detection may be bypassed.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Based on Microsoft documentation, legacy systems or applications will use RC4-HMAC as the default encryption for Kerberos Service Ticket requests. Specifically, 
  systems before Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. Newer systems will use AES128 or AES256.
