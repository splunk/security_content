description: 'The following analytic detects Kerberos service ticket requests using
  RC4 encryption, leveraging Kerberos Event 4769. This method identifies potential
  Golden Ticket attacks, where adversaries forge Kerberos Granting Tickets (TGT) using
  the Krbtgt account NTLM password hash to gain unrestricted access to an Active Directory
  environment. Monitoring for RC4 encryption usage is significant as it is rare in
  modern networks, indicating possible malicious activity. If confirmed malicious,
  attackers could move laterally and execute code on remote systems, compromising
  the entire network. Note: This detection may be bypassed if attackers use the AES
  key instead of the NTLM hash.'
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4769
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4769 ServiceName="*$" (TicketOptions=0x40810000
  OR TicketOptions=0x40800000 OR TicketOptions=0x40810010) TicketEncryptionType=0x17
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, service, service_id,
  TicketEncryptionType, TicketOptions | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `kerberos_service_ticket_request_using_rc4_encryption_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Based on Microsoft documentation, legacy systems or applications
  will use RC4-HMAC as the default encryption for Kerberos Service Ticket requests.
  Specifically, systems before Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. Newer systems
  will use AES128 or AES256.
