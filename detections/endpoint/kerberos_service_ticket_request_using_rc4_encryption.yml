description: The following analytic leverages Kerberos Event 4769, A Kerberos service
  ticket was requested, to identify a potential Kerberos Service Ticket request related
  to a Golden Ticket attack. Adversaries who have obtained the Krbtgt account NTLM
  password hash may forge a Kerberos Granting Ticket (TGT) to obtain unrestricted
  access to an Active Directory environment. Armed with a Golden Ticket, attackers
  can request service tickets to move laterally and execute code on remote systems.
  Looking for Kerberos Service Ticket requests using the legacy RC4 encryption mechanism
  could represent the second stage of a Golden Ticket attack. RC4 usage should be
  rare on a modern network since Windows Vista & Windows Sever 2008 and newer support
  AES Kerberos encryption.\ Defenders should note that if an attacker does not leverage
  the NTLM password hash but rather the AES key to create a golden ticket, this detection
  may be bypassed.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Based on Microsoft documentation, legacy systems or applications
  will use RC4-HMAC as the default encryption for Kerberos Service Ticket requests.
  Specifically, systems before Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. Newer systems
  will use AES128 or AES256.
