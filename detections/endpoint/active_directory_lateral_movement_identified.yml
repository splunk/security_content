description: The following analytic identifies potential lateral movement activities
  within an organization's Active Directory (AD) environment. It detects this activity
  by correlating multiple analytics from the Active Directory Lateral Movement analytic
  story within a specified time frame. This is significant for a SOC as lateral movement
  is a common tactic used by attackers to expand their access within a network, posing
  a substantial risk. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to escalate privileges, access sensitive information, and persist within the environment,
  leading to severe security breaches.

  source_count >= 4 | `active_directory_lateral_movement_identified_filter`'
how_to_implement: Splunk Enterprise Security is required to utilize this correlation.
  In addition, modify the source_count value to your environment. In our testing,
  a count of 4 or 5 was decent in a lab, but the number may need to be increased as
  the analytic story includes over 30 analytics. In addition, based on false positives,
  modify any analytics to be anomaly and lower or increase risk based on organization
  importance.
known_false_positives: False positives will most likely be present based on risk scoring
  and how the organization handles system to system communication. Filter, or modify
  as needed. In addition to count by analytics, adding a risk score may be useful.
  In our testing, with 22 events over 30 days, the risk scores ranged from 500 to
  80,000. Your organization will be different, monitor and modify as needed.
