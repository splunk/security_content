type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies unusually long command lines executed
  on hosts, which may indicate malicious activity. It leverages the Machine Learning
  Toolkit (MLTK) to detect command lines with lengths that deviate from the norm for
  a given user. This is significant for a SOC as unusually long command lines can
  be a sign of obfuscation or complex malicious scripts. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could allow attackers to execute sophisticated commands, potentially leading
  to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications use long command lines for installs
  or updates. You should review identified command lines for legitimacy. You may modify
  the first part of the search to omit legitimate command lines from consideration.
  If you are seeing more results than desired, you may consider changing the value
  of threshold in the search to a smaller value. You should also periodically re-run
  the support search to re-build the ML model on the latest data. You may get unexpected
  results if the user identified in the results is not present in the data used to
  build the associated model.
