description: The following query utilizes Windows Security EventCode 4698, `A scheduled
  task was created`, to identify suspicious tasks registered on Windows either via
  schtasks.exe OR TaskService with an arguments "HTTP" string that are unique entry
  of malware or attack that uses lolbin to download other file or payload to the infected
  machine. The search will return the first time and last time the task was registered,
  as well as the `Command` to be executed, `Task Name`, `Author`, `Enabled`, and whether
  it is `Hidden` or not. schtasks.exe is natively found in `C:\Windows\system32` and
  `C:\Windows\syswow64`. The following DLL(s) are loaded when schtasks.exe or TaskService
  is launched -`taskschd.dll`. If found loaded by another process, it is possible
  a scheduled task is being registered within that process context in memory. Upon
  triage, identify the task scheduled source. Was it schtasks.exe or via TaskService?
  Review the job created and the Command to be executed. Capture any artifacts on
  disk and review. Identify any parallel processes within the same timeframe to identify
  source.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the task schedule (Exa. Security Log EventCode 4698) endpoints. Tune and
  filter known instances of Task schedule used in your environment.
