description: The following analytic identifies the execution of suspicious processes
  typically associated with webshell activity on web servers. It detects when processes
  like `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `bash.exe` are spawned by web server processes
  such as `w3wp.exe` or `nginx.exe`. This behavior is significant as it may indicate
  an adversary exploiting a web application vulnerability to install a webshell, providing
  persistent access and command execution capabilities. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could allow attackers to maintain control over the compromised server,
  execute arbitrary commands, and potentially escalate privileges or exfiltrate sensitive
  data.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate OS functions called by vendor applications, baseline
  the environment and filter before enabling. Recommend throttle by dest/process_name
