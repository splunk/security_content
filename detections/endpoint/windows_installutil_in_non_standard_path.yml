description: The following analytic detects the execution of InstallUtil.exe from
  non-standard paths. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing
  on process names and original file names outside typical directories. This activity
  is significant because InstallUtil.exe is often used by attackers to execute malicious
  code or scripts. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to
  bypass security controls, execute arbitrary code, and potentially gain unauthorized
  access or persist within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_installutil` NOT (Processes.process_path
  IN ("*\\Windows\\ADWS\\*","*\\Windows\\SysWOW64*", "*\\Windows\\system32*", "*\\Windows\\NetworkController\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\SystemApps\\*", "*\\WinSxS\\*", "*\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\*")) by

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_installutil_in_non_standard_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may be required.
  Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application
  in use.
