description: The following analytic detects modifications in the Windows registry
  to disable Windows Defender generic reports. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
  data model, specifically monitoring changes to the "DisableGenericRePorts" registry
  value. This activity is significant as it can prevent the transmission of error
  reports to Microsoft's Windows Error Reporting service, potentially hiding malicious
  activities. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to bypass
  Windows Defender detections, reducing the visibility of their activities and increasing
  the risk of undetected system compromise.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\Reporting\\DisableGenericRePorts" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001"
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_disable_win_defender_gen_reports_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
