description: 'This detection searches for Windows Defender ASR block events. ASR is a feature of Windows Defender Exploit Guard that prevents actions and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines. ASR rules are applied to processes and applications. When a process or application attempts to perform an action that is blocked by an ASR rule, an event is generated. This detection searches for ASR block events that are generated when a process or application attempts to perform an action that is blocked by an ASR rule. Typically, these will be enabled in block most after auditing and tuning the ASR rules themselves. Set to TTP once tuned.'

how_to_implement: The following analytic requires collection of Windows Defender Operational logs in either XML or multi-line. To collect, setup a new input for the Windows Defender Operational logs. In addition, it does require a lookup that maps the ID to ASR Rule name. Note that Audit and block Event IDs have different fields, therefore the analytic will need to be modified for each type of event. 
known_false_positives: False positives are expected from legitimate applications generating events that are similar to those generated by malicious activity. For example, Event ID 1122 is generated when a process attempts to load a DLL that is blocked by an ASR rule. This can be triggered by legitimate applications that attempt to load DLLs that are not blocked by ASR rules. This is block only.
