name: Linux Deletion Of Init Daemon Script
id: 729aab57-d26f-4156-b97f-ab8dda8f44b1

status: production
type: TTP
description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of init daemon script in a linux
  machine. daemon script that place in /etc/init.d/ is a directory that can start
  and stop some daemon services in linux machines. attacker may delete or modify daemon
  script to impair some security features or act as defense evasion in a compromised
  linux machine. This TTP can be also a good indicator of a malware trying to wipe
  or delete several files in compromised host as part of its destructive payload like
  what acidrain malware does in linux or router machines. This detection can be a
  good pivot to check what process and user tries to delete this type of files which
  is not so common and need further investigation.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.action=deleted Filesystem.file_path
  IN ( "/etc/init.d/*") by _time span=1h Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path
  Filesystem.dest Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.action | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_deletion_of_init_daemon_script_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
