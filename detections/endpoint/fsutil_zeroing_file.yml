description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'fsutil' command
  with the 'setzerodata' parameter, which zeros out a target file. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because it is a technique
  used by ransomware, such as LockBit, to evade detection by erasing its malware path
  after encrypting the host. If confirmed malicious, this action could hinder forensic
  investigations and allow attackers to cover their tracks, complicating incident
  response efforts.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=fsutil.exe
  Processes.process="*setzerodata*" by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.dest  Processes.process Processes.parent_process | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `fsutil_zeroing_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
