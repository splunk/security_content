data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the PowerView PowerShell
  cmdlet Get-NetUser, specifically querying for "samaccountname" and "pwdlastset"
  attributes. It leverages Event ID 4104 from PowerShell Script Block Logging to identify
  this activity. This behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to gather
  user account information from Active Directory, which is a common reconnaissance
  step in lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow an attacker to map out user accounts, potentially leading
  to further exploitation and unauthorized access within the network.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104  ScriptBlockText = "*Get-NetUser*" ScriptBlockText
  IN ("*samaccountname*", "*pwdlastset*") | rename Computer as dest, UserID as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  dest user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_account_discovery_for_sam_account_name_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.=
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerView for legitimate purposes,
  filter as needed.
