description: The following analytic is designed to detect potential security threats
  involving the misuse of system trust. It works by detecting events where a process
  attempts to add a certificate to the untrusted certificate store, an action often
  associated with disabling security tools. The analytic uses Sysmon Event ID 1 data
  source, particularly focusing on process activities and command-line arguments related
  to 'certutil -addstore'. It's essential to ingest data that records process activity
  and logs containing process names and command lines for its effective operation.
  Be aware, sometimes administrators might legitimately perform this action. The analytic's
  value lies in detecting isolated or unexpected instances, indicative of potential
  malicious activities. Cybersecurity analysts should understand the importance of
  trust mechanisms and their subversion in system security.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime values(Processes.process)
  as process max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_certutil`
  (Processes.process=*-addstore*) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `attempt_to_add_certificate_to_untrusted_store_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons for administrators to add a
  certificate to the untrusted certificate store. In such cases, this will typically
  be done on a large number of systems.
