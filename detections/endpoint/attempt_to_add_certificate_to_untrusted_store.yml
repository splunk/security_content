name: Attempt To Add Certificate To Untrusted Store

description: |-
  The following analytic detects attempts to add a certificate to the untrusted certificate store using the 'certutil -addstore' command. It leverages process activity and command-line arguments from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs mapped to the Splunk `Processes` data model. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attacker trying to disable security tools to gain unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to the compromise of system security, allowing attackers to bypass defenses and potentially escalate privileges or persist in the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime values(Processes.process)
  as process max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_certutil`
  (Processes.process=*-addstore*) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `attempt_to_add_certificate_to_untrusted_store_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons for administrators to add a
  certificate to the untrusted certificate store. In such cases, this will typically
  be done on a large number of systems.
