how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.

known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons for administrators to add a
  certificate to the untrusted certificate store. In such cases, this will typically
  be done on a large number of systems.
