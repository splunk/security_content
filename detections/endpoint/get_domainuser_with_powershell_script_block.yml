description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-DomainUser`
  cmdlet using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This cmdlet is part
  of PowerView, a tool often used for domain enumeration. The detection leverages
  PowerShell operational logs to identify instances where this command is executed.
  Monitoring this activity is crucial as it may indicate an adversary's attempt to
  gather information about domain users, which is a common step in Active Directory
  Discovery. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to further reconnaissance
  and potential exploitation of domain resources.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*Get-DomainUser*" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText
  Computer UserID | rename Computer as dest, UserID as user| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `get_domainuser_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
