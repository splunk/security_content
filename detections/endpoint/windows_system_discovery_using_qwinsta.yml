description: The following analytic detects the execution of "qwinsta.exe" on a Windows
  operating system. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. The "qwinsta.exe" tool is significant
  because it can display detailed session information on a remote desktop session
  host server. This behavior is noteworthy as it is commonly abused by Qakbot malware
  to gather system information and send it back to its Command and Control (C2) server.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized data exfiltration
  and further compromise of the host.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator may execute this commandline tool for auditing
  purposes. Filter as needed.
