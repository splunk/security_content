- Endpoint
description: This search looks for execution of commonly used attacker tools on an
  endpoint.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime values(Processes.process) as process values(Processes.parent_process)
  as parent_process from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.dest!=unknown
  Processes.user!=unknown by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.process | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | lookup attacker_tools attacker_tool_names AS
  process_name OUTPUT description | search description !=false| `attacker_tools_on_endpoint_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is usually generated via logs that report process tracking
  in your Windows audit settings.
known_false_positives: Some administrator activity can be potentially triggered, please
  add those users to the filter macro.
