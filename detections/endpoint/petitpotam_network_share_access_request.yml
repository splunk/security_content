description: 'The following analytic detects network share access requests indicative
  of the PetitPotam attack (CVE-2021-36942). It leverages Windows Event Code 5145,
  which logs attempts to access network share objects. This detection is significant
  as PetitPotam can coerce authentication from domain controllers, potentially leading
  to unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network, posing a severe security
  risk. Ensure Event Code 5145 is enabled via Group Policy to utilize this analytic
  effectively.'
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 5145
search: '`wineventlog_security` SubjectUserName="ANONYMOUS LOGON" EventCode=5145 RelativeTargetName=lsarpc
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, SubjectUserSid,
  ShareName, src, AccessMask, AccessReason | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `petitpotam_network_share_access_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: Windows Event Code 5145 is required to utilize this analytic and
  it may not be enabled in most environments.
known_false_positives: False positives have been limited when the Anonymous Logon
  is used for Account Name.
