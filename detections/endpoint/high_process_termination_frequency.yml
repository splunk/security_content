name: High Process Termination Frequency

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a high frequency of process termination
  events on a computer within a short period. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 5 logs
  to detect instances where 15 or more processes are terminated within a 3-second
  window. This behavior is significant as it is commonly associated with ransomware
  attempting to avoid exceptions during file encryption. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could indicate an active ransomware attack, potentially leading to widespread
  file encryption and significant data loss.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 5
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=5 |bin _time span=3s |stats values(Image) as proc_terminated
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  count by _time dest EventCode ProcessID
  | where count >= 15 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `high_process_termination_frequency_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Image (process full path of terminated process) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: admin or user tool that can terminate multiple process.
