description: This analytics are designed to indentify a high frequency of process
  termination on a machine which is a common behavior of ransomware malware before
  encrypting files. This technique is designed to avoid an exception error while accessing
  (docs, images, database and etc..) in the infected machine for encryption.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=5 |bin _time span=3s |stats values(Image) as proc_terminated
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  count by Computer EventCode ProcessID
  | where count >= 15 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `high_process_termination_frequency_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Image (process full path of terminated process) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: admin or user tool that can terminate multiple process.
