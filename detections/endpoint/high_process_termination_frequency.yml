description: This analytic is designed to identify a high frequency of process termination
  events on a computer in a short period of time, which is a common behavior of ransomware
  malware before encrypting files. This technique is designed to avoid an exception
  error while accessing (docs, images, database and etc..) in the infected machine
  for encryption.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 5
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=5 |bin _time span=3s |stats values(Image) as proc_terminated
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  count by _time dest EventCode
  ProcessID | where count >= 15 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `high_process_termination_frequency_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Image (process full path of terminated process) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: admin or user tool that can terminate multiple process.
