description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that disable Windows Defender's file hash computation by setting the EnableFileHashComputation
  value to 0. This detection leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model,
  focusing on changes to the specific registry path associated with Windows Defender.
  Disabling file hash computation can significantly impair Windows Defender's ability
  to detect and scan for malware, making it a critical behavior to monitor. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow attackers to bypass Windows Defender, facilitating
  undetected malware execution and persistence in the environment.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\MpEngine\\EnableFileHashComputation" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000000"
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data
  Registry.action Registry.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_disable_win_defender_compute_file_hashes_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
