description: The following analytic detects the creation of an lsass.exe process dump
  using Windows Task Manager. It leverages Sysmon EventID 11 to identify file creation
  events where the target filename matches *lsass*.dmp. This activity is significant
  because creating an lsass dump can be a precursor to credential theft, as the dump
  file contains sensitive information such as user passwords. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could use the lsass dump to extract credentials and escalate privileges,
  potentially compromising the entire network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '`sysmon` EventID=11 process_name=taskmgr.exe TargetFilename=*lsass*.dmp |
  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, object_category,
  process_name, TargetFilename  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `creation_of_lsass_dump_with_taskmgr_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requires Sysmon Logs and a Sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 11 for detecting file create of lsass.dmp. This search uses an
  input macro named `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific
  configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace
  the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search
  also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: Administrators can create memory dumps for debugging purposes,
  but memory dumps of the LSASS process would be unusual.
