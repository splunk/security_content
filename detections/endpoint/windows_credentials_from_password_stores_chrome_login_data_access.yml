description: The following analytic identifies a non-chrome process accessing Chrome user data "login data" file. 
  This sqlite db file stores various information related to the browser's operation on your computer. Threat actor, adversaries and malware author 
  also abused this file to attempt to extract and decrypt password saved in chrome browser.
  This anomaly detection can be a good pivot of analysis for suspicious process aside from chrome.exe and explorer.exe executable.
