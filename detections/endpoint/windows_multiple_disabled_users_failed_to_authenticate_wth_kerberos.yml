description: 'The following analytic detects a single source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique disabled domain users using the Kerberos protocol within 5 minutes.
  It leverages Windows Security Event 4768, focusing on failure code `0x12`, indicating
  revoked credentials. This activity is significant as it may indicate a Password
  Spraying attack targeting disabled accounts, a tactic used by adversaries to gain
  initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the Active Directory environment,
  posing a severe security risk.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple disabled domain
  users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, multi-user systems missconfigured
  systems.
