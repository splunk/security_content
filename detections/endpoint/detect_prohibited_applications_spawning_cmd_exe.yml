description: This search looks for executions of cmd.exe spawned by a process that
  is often abused by attackers and that does not typically launch cmd.exe.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_cmd` by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.dest Processes.user| `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` |search [`prohibited_apps_launching_cmd`] | `detect_prohibited_applications_spawning_cmd_exe_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts and populates the Endpoint data model with the resultant dataset. This search
  includes a lookup file, `prohibited_apps_launching_cmd.csv`, that contains a list
  of processes that should not be spawning cmd.exe. You can modify this lookup to
  better suit your environment. To successfully implement this search you need to
  be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible
  for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes`
  node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the
  latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: There are circumstances where an application may legitimately
  execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface. Investigate and modify
  the lookup file, as appropriate.
