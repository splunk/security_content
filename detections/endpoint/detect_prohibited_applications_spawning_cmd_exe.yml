description: The following analytic detects executions of cmd.exe spawned by processes
  that are commonly abused by attackers and do not typically launch cmd.exe. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process GUID,
  process name, parent process, and command-line executions. This activity is significant
  because it may indicate an attempt to execute unauthorized commands or scripts,
  often a precursor to further malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or persistence
  within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: There are circumstances where an application may legitimately
  execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface. Investigate and modify
  the lookup file, as appropriate.
