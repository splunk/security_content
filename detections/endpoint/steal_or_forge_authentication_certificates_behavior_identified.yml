description: The following analytic identifies potential threats related to the theft
  or forgery of authentication certificates. It detects when five or more analytics
  from the Windows Certificate Services story trigger within a specified timeframe.
  This detection leverages aggregated risk scores and event counts from the Risk data
  model. This activity is significant as it may indicate an ongoing attack aimed at
  compromising authentication mechanisms. If confirmed malicious, attackers could
  gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data, potentially leading to severe
  security breaches.

how_to_implement: The Windows Certificate Services analytic story must have 5 or more
  analytics enabled. In addition, ensure data is being logged that is required. Modify
  the correlation as needed based on volume of noise related to the other analytics.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on automated tooling or
  system administrators. Filter as needed.
