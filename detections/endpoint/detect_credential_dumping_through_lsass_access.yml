description: This search looks for reading lsass memory consistent with credential
  dumping.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe (GrantedAccess=0x1010 OR GrantedAccess=0x1410)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, SourceImage,
  SourceProcessId, TargetImage, TargetProcessId, EventCode, GrantedAccess | rename
  Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_credential_dumping_through_lsass_access_filter` '
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs and a sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 10 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: The activity may be legitimate. Other tools can access lsass
  for legitimate reasons, and it's possible this event could be generated in those
  cases. In these cases, false positives should be fairly obvious and you may need
  to tweak the search to eliminate noise.

  message: The $source_image$ has attempted access to read $TargetImage$ was identified
    on endpoint $Computer$, this is indicative of credential dumping and should be
    investigated.
