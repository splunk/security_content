description: The following analytic detects attempts to read LSASS memory, indicative
  of credential dumping. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 10, filtering for specific
  access permissions (0x1010 and 0x1410) on the lsass.exe process. This activity is
  significant because it suggests an attacker is trying to extract credentials from
  LSASS memory, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise
  of sensitive information. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to
  escalate privileges, move laterally within the network, or exfiltrate data. Extensive
  triage is necessary to differentiate between malicious and benign activities.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe (GrantedAccess=0x1010 OR GrantedAccess=0x1410)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, SourceImage,
  SourceProcessId, TargetImage, TargetProcessId, EventCode, GrantedAccess | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_credential_dumping_through_lsass_access_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search needs Sysmon Logs and a sysmon configuration, which
  includes EventCode 10 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
known_false_positives: The activity may be legitimate. Other tools can access lsass
  for legitimate reasons, and it's possible this event could be generated in those
  cases. In these cases, false positives should be fairly obvious and you may need
  to tweak the search to eliminate noise.

    on endpoint $dest$, this is indicative of credential dumping and should be investigated.
