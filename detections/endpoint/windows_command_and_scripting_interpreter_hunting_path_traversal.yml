description: The following analytic identifies path traversal command-line execution
  and should be used to tune and driver other more higher fidelity analytics. This
  technique was seen in malicious document that execute malicious code using msdt.exe
  and path traversal technique that serve as defense evasion. This Hunting query is
  a good pivot to look for possible suspicious process and command-line that runs
  execute path traversal technique to run malicious code. This may help you to find
  possible downloaded malware or other lolbin execution.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: false positive may vary depends on the score you want to check.
  The bigger number of path traversal string count the better.
