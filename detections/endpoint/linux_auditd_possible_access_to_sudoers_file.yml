name: Linux Auditd Possible Access To Sudoers File

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects potential access or modification of the /etc/sudoers file on a Linux system. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on processes like "cat," "nano," "vim," and "vi" accessing the /etc/sudoers file. This activity is significant because the sudoers file controls user permissions for executing commands with elevated privileges. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain persistence or escalate privileges, compromising the security of the targeted host.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Path
search: '`linux_auditd` type=PATH name="/etc/sudoers*" | rename host as dest | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by name nametype OGID type dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_possible_access_to_sudoers_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: administrator or network operator can execute this command. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
