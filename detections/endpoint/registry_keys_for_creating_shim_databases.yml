description: This search looks for registry activity associated with application compatibility
  shims, which can be leveraged by attackers for various nefarious purposes.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must populate the Change_Analysis
  data model. This is typically populated via endpoint detection and response products,
  such as Carbon Black or other endpoint data sources such as Sysmon. The data used
  for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes to
  the registry.

  for compatibility purposes for legacy applications
