description: The following analytic identifies all drivers being loaded on Windows
  systems using Sysmon EventCode 6 (Driver Load). It leverages fields such as driver
  path, signature status, and hash to detect potentially suspicious drivers. This
  activity is significant for a SOC as malicious drivers can be used to gain kernel-level
  access, bypass security controls, or persist in the environment. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with high privileges,
  leading to severe system compromise and potential data exfiltration.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 6
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=6 | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  values(ImageLoaded) count by dest Signed Signature service_signature_verified service_signature_exists
  Hashes | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_drivers_loaded_by_signature_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have the latest version of the Sysmon
  TA. Most EDR products provide the ability to review driver loads, or module loads,
  and using a query as such help with hunting for malicious drivers.
known_false_positives: This analytic is meant to assist with identifying drivers loaded
  in the environment and not to be setup for notables off the bat.
