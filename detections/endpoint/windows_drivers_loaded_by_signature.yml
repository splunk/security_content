description: The following analytic assists with viewing all drivers being loaded
  by using Sysmon EventCode 6 (Driver Load). Sysmon provides some simple fields to
  assist with identifying suspicious drivers. Use this analytic to look at prevalence
  of driver (count), path of driver, signature status and hash. Review these fields
  with scrutiny until the ability to prove the driver is legitimate and has a purpose
  in the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 6
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=6 | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  values(ImageLoaded) count by dest Signed Signature service_signature_verified
  service_signature_exists Hashes | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_drivers_loaded_by_signature_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have the latest version of the Sysmon
  TA. Most EDR products provide the ability to review driver loads, or module loads,
  and using a query as such help with hunting for malicious drivers.
known_false_positives: This analytic is meant to assist with identifying drivers loaded
  in the environment and not to be setup for notables off the bat.
