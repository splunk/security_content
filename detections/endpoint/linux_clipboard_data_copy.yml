description: The following analytic identifies the use of Linux Xclip copying data out of the clipboard. Adversaries have utilized this technique to capture passwords, IP addresses, or store payloads.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=xclip Processes.process IN ("*-o *", "*-sel *", "*-selection *", "*clip *","*clipboard*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `linux_clipboard_data_copy_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present on Linux desktop as it may commonly be used by administrators or end users. Filter as needed.
