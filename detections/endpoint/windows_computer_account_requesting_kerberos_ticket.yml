description: The following analytic detects a computer account requesting a Kerberos
  ticket, which is unusual as typically user accounts request these tickets. This
  detection leverages Windows Security Event Logs, specifically EventCode 4768, to
  identify instances where the TargetUserName ends with a dollar sign ($), indicating
  a computer account. This activity is significant because it may indicate the use
  of tools like KrbUpRelay or other Kerberos-based attacks. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to impersonate computer accounts, potentially leading
  to unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4768
search: '`wineventlog_security`  EventCode=4768 TargetUserName="*$"  src_ip!="::1"
  | stats  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, subject,
  action, user, TargetUserName, src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_computer_account_requesting_kerberos_ticket_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4768 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: It is possible false positives will be present based on third
  party applications. Filtering may be needed.
