description: The following analytic identifies a ComputerAccount requesting a Kerberos
  Ticket. typically, a user account requests a Kerberos ticket. This behavior was
  identified with KrbUpRelay, but additional Kerberos attacks have exhibited similar
  behavior.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4768
search: '`wineventlog_security`  EventCode=4768 TargetUserName="*$"  src_ip!="::1" 
  | stats  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, subject, action, user, TargetUserName, src_ip 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_computer_account_requesting_kerberos_ticket_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4768 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: It is possible false positives will be present based on third
  party applications. Filtering may be needed.
