description: The following analytic detects suspicious PowerShell processes attempting
  to inject code into critical Windows processes using CreateRemoteThread. It leverages
  Sysmon EventCode 8 to identify instances where PowerShell spawns threads in processes
  like svchost.exe, csrss.exe, and others. This activity is significant as it is commonly
  used by malware such as TrickBot and offensive tools like Cobalt Strike to execute
  malicious payloads, establish reverse shells, or download additional malware. If
  confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege
  escalation, and persistent access within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventCode = 8 parent_process_name IN ("powershell_ise.exe", "powershell.exe")
  TargetImage IN ("*\\svchost.exe","*\\csrss.exe" "*\\gpupdate.exe", "*\\explorer.exe","*\\services.exe","*\\winlogon.exe","*\\smss.exe","*\\wininit.exe","*\\userinit.exe","*\\spoolsv.exe","*\\taskhost.exe")
  | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by SourceImage process_name
  SourceProcessId SourceProcessGuid TargetImage TargetProcessId NewThreadId StartAddress
  dest EventCode | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_remote_thread_to_known_windows_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, Create Remote thread from your endpoints. If you are
  using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter
  known instances of create remote thread may be used.
