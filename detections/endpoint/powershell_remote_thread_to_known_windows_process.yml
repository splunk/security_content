description: this search is designed to detect suspicious powershell process that
  tries to inject code and to known/critical windows process and execute it using
  CreateRemoteThread. This technique is seen in several malware like trickbot and
  offensive tooling like cobaltstrike where it load a shellcode to svchost.exe to
  execute reverse shell to c2 and download another payload
search: '`sysmon` EventCode = 8 process_name IN ("powershell_ise.exe", "powershell.exe")
  TargetImage IN ("*\\svchost.exe","*\\csrss.exe" "*\\gpupdate.exe", "*\\explorer.exe","*\\services.exe","*\\winlogon.exe","*\\smss.exe","*\\wininit.exe","*\\userinit.exe","*\\spoolsv.exe","*\\taskhost.exe")
  | stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by SourceImage process_name
  SourceProcessId SourceProcessGuid TargetImage TargetProcessId NewThreadId StartAddress
  Computer EventCode | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_remote_thread_to_known_windows_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, Create Remote thread from your endpoints. If you are
  using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter
  known instances of create remote thread may be used.
