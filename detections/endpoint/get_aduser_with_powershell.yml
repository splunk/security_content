description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments used to enumerate domain users via the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an attempt by adversaries to gather information about domain users for
  situational awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this
  behavior could lead to further reconnaissance, enabling attackers to identify high-value
  targets and plan subsequent attacks.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name="cmd.exe"
  OR Processes.process_name="powershell*") AND Processes.process = "*Get-ADUser*"
  AND Processes.process = "*-filter*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.parent_process_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `get_aduser_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
