description: The following analytic detects a Microsoft Office product spawning the
  Windows msdt.exe process. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where Office applications
  are the parent process. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt
  to exploit protocol handlers to bypass security controls, even if macros are disabled.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral
  movement within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("winword.exe","excel.exe","powerpnt.exe","outlook.exe","mspub.exe","visio.exe","onenote.exe","onenotem.exe","onenoteviewer.exe","onenoteim.exe","msaccess.exe")

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_office_product_spawning_msdt_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however filter as needed.
