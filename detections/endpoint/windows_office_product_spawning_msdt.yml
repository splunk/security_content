- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies a Microsoft Office product spawning
  the Windows msdt.exe process. MSDT is a Diagnostics Troubleshooting Wizard native
  to Windows. This behavior is related to a recently identified sample utilizing protocol
  handlers to evade preventative controls, including if macros are disabled in the
  document. During triage, review file modifications for html. In addition, parallel
  processes including PowerShell and CertUtil.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN ("winword.exe","excel.exe","powerpnt.exe","outlook.exe","mspub.exe","visio.exe")
  Processes.process_name=msdt.exe by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_office_product_spawning_msdt_filter`'
how_to_implement: how To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting
  information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the
  changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
  In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest
  TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however filter as needed.
