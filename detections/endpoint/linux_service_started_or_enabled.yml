description: The following analytic detects the creation or enabling of services in
  Linux platforms, specifically using the systemctl or service tool application. This
  behavior is worth identifying as adversaries may create or modify services to execute
  malicious payloads as part of persistence. Legitimate services created by administrators
  for automation purposes may also trigger this analytic, so it is important to update
  the filter macros to remove false positives. If a true positive is found, it suggests
  an possible attacker is attempting to persist within the environment or deliver
  additional malicious payloads, leading to data theft, ransomware, or other damaging
  outcomes. To implement this analytic, ensure you are ingesting logs with the process
  name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name IN ("systemctl",
  "service") OR Processes.process IN ("*systemctl *", "*service *")) Processes.process
  IN ("* start *", "* enable *") AND NOT (Processes.os="Microsoft Windows" OR Processes.vendor_product="Microsoft Windows") 
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_service_started_or_enabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this commandline
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
