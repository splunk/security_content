author: Teoderick Contreras, Splunk
status: production
type: TTP
description: This search is to detect a possible uac bypass using the colorui.dll
  COM Object. this technique was seen in so many malware and ransomware like lockbit
  where it make use of the colorui.dll COM CLSID to bypass UAC.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 ImageLoaded="*\\colorui.dll" process_name != "colorcpl.exe"
  NOT(Image IN("*\\windows\\*", "*\\program files*")) | stats count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded process_name dest user_id EventCode Signed ProcessId | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `uac_bypass_with_colorui_com_object_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: not so common. but 3rd part app may load this dll.
