description: This search is used to detect the abuse of the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO)
  character (U+202E) RTLO. This technique is used by adversaries to disguise a string and/or 
  file name to make it appear benign. The RTLO character is a non-printing Unicode 
  character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that includes the full command line of the process being launched on
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Implementation in regions that use right to left in native language.
