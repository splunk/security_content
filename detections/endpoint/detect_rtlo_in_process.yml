description: The following analytic identifies the abuse of the right-to-left override
  (RTLO) character (U+202E) in process names. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line data.
  This activity is significant because adversaries use the RTLO character to disguise
  malicious files or commands, making them appear benign. If confirmed malicious,
  this technique can allow attackers to execute harmful code undetected, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Implementation in regions that use right to left in native
  language.
