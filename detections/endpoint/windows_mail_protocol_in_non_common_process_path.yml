description: The following analytic identifies a possible windows application having
  a SMTP connection in a non common installation path in windows operating system.This
  network protocol is being used by adversaries, threat actors and malware like AgentTesla
  as a Command And Control communication to transfer its collected stolen information
  like the desktop screenshots, browser information and system information of a targeted
  or compromised host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 3
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=3 NOT(Image IN("*\\program files*", "*\\thunderbird.exe","*\\outlook.exe"))
  (DestinationPortName="smtp" OR DestinationPort=25 OR DestinationPort=587) | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image DestinationPort DestinationPortName
  DestinationHostname SourceHostname SourcePort SourcePortName Protocol DestinationIp
  dest user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_mail_protocol_in_non_common_process_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and sysmon eventcode = 3 connection events from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: third party application may use this network protocol as part
  of its feature. Filter is needed.
