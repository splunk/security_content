description: The following analytic detects a Windows application establishing an
  SMTP connection from a non-common installation path. It leverages Sysmon EventCode
  3 to identify processes not typically associated with email clients (e.g., Thunderbird,
  Outlook) making SMTP connections. This activity is significant as adversaries, including
  malware like AgentTesla, use such connections for Command and Control (C2) communication
  to exfiltrate stolen data. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized
  data exfiltration, including sensitive information like desktop screenshots, browser
  data, and system details, compromising the affected host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 3
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=3 NOT(Image IN("*\\program files*", "*\\thunderbird.exe","*\\outlook.exe"))
  (DestinationPortName="smtp" OR DestinationPort=25 OR DestinationPort=587) | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image DestinationPort DestinationPortName
  DestinationHostname SourceHostname SourcePort SourcePortName Protocol DestinationIp
  dest user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_mail_protocol_in_non_common_process_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and sysmon eventcode = 3 connection events from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: third party application may use this network protocol as part
  of its feature. Filter is needed.
