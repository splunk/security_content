description: The following analytic detects the execution of a renamed `rclone.exe`
  process, which is commonly used for data exfiltration to remote destinations. This
  detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on
  process names and original file names that do not match. This activity is significant
  because ransomware groups often use RClone to exfiltrate sensitive data. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could indicate an ongoing data exfiltration attempt, potentially
  leading to significant data loss and further compromise of the affected systems.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.original_file_name=rclone.exe
  AND Processes.process_name!=rclone.exe) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.original_file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_renamed_rclone_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this analytic identifies
  renamed instances of `rclone.exe`. Filter as needed if there is a legitimate business
  use case.
