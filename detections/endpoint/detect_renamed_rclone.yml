description: The following analytic identifies the usage of `rclone.exe`, renamed,
  being used to exfiltrate data to a remote destination. RClone has been used by multiple
  ransomware groups to exfiltrate data. In many instances, it will be downloaded from
  the legitimate site and executed accordingly. During triage, isolate the endpoint
  and begin to review parallel processes for additional behavior. At this stage, the
  adversary may have staged data to be exfiltrated.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=1 OriginalFileName=rclone.exe NOT process_name=rclone.exe
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, User,
  parent_process_name, process_name, OriginalFileName, process_path, CommandLine |
  rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_renamed_rclone_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this analytic identifies
  renamed instances of `rclone.exe`. Filter as needed if there is a legitimate business
  use case.
