description: The following analytic identifies the usage of `rclone.exe`, renamed,
  being used to exfiltrate data to a remote destination. RClone has been used by multiple
  ransomware groups to exfiltrate data. In many instances, it will be downloaded from
  the legitimate site and executed accordingly. During triage, isolate the endpoint
  and begin to review parallel processes for additional behavior. At this stage, the
  adversary may have staged data to be exfiltrated.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.original_file_name=rclone.exe
  AND Processes.process_name!=rclone.exe) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.original_file_name | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_renamed_rclone_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this analytic identifies
  renamed instances of `rclone.exe`. Filter as needed if there is a legitimate business
  use case.
