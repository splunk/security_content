description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves
  information related to private keys files. This technique was seen in several post
  exploitation tools like winpeas that are being used by Ransomware Prestige to search
  for private key certificates on the compromised host for insecurely stored credentials.
  This files can be used by adversaries to gain privileges, persistence or remote
  service authentication to collect more sensitive information. Some private keys
  required password for operation, so in this case adversaries may need to have that
  passphrase either via keylogging or brute force attack.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*dir *"
  OR  Processes.process = "*findstr*" AND Processes.process IN ( "*.rdg*", "*.gpg*",
  "*.pgp*", "*.p12*", "*.der*", "*.csr*", "*.cer*", "*.ovpn*", "*.key*",  "*.ppk*",
  "*.p12*", "*.pem*", "*.pfx*", "*.p7b*", "*.asc*") by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_private_keys_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
