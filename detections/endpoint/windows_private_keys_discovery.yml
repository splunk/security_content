description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves
  information related to private keys files. This technique was seen in several post
  exploitation tools like winpeas that are being used by Ransomware Prestige to search
  for private key certificates on the compromised host for insecurely stored credentials.
  This files can be used by adversaries to gain privileges, persistence or remote
  service authentication to collect more sensitive information. Some private keys
  required password for operation, so in this case adversaries may need to have that
  passphrase either via keylogging or brute force attack.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*dir *"
  OR  Processes.process = "*findstr*" AND Processes.process IN ( "*.rdg*", "*.gpg*",
  "*.pgp*", "*.p12*", "*.der*", "*.csr*", "*.cer*", "*.ovpn*", "*.key*",  "*.ppk*",

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
