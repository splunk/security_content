description: The following analytic identifies processes that retrieve information
  related to private key files, often used by post-exploitation tools like winpeas.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on command-line executions that search for private key certificates. This
  activity is significant as it indicates potential attempts to locate insecurely
  stored credentials, which adversaries can exploit for privilege escalation, persistence,
  or remote service authentication. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow
  attackers to access sensitive information, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence
  within the compromised environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*dir *"
  OR  Processes.process = "*findstr*" AND Processes.process IN ( "*.rdg*", "*.gpg*",
  "*.pgp*", "*.p12*", "*.der*", "*.csr*", "*.cer*", "*.ovpn*", "*.key*",  "*.ppk*",
  "*.p12*", "*.pem*", "*.pfx*", "*.p7b*", "*.asc*") by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

  | `windows_private_keys_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
