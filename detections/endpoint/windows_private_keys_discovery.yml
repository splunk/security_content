description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves information related to private keys files. 
  This technique was seen in several post exploitation tools like winpeas that are being used by Ransomware Prestige to 
  search for private key certificates on the compromised host for insecurely stored credentials. This files can be used by adversaries to gain privileges, 
  persistence or remote service authentication to collect more sensitive information. Some private keys required password for operation, so in this case adversaries 
  may need to have that passphrase either via keylogging or brute force attack.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process = "*dir *" OR  Processes.process = "*findstr*"
  AND Processes.process IN ( "*.rdg*", "*.gpg*", "*.pgp*", "*.p12*", "*.der*", "*.csr*", "*.cer*", "*.ovpn*", "*.key*",  "*.ppk*", "*.p12*", "*.pem*", "*.pfx*", "*.p7b*", "*.asc*")
  by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid 
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_private_keys_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
