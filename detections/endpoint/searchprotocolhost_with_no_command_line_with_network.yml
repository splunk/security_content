description: The following analytic detects instances of searchprotocolhost.exe running
  without command line arguments but with an active network connection. This behavior
  is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on
  process execution and network traffic data. It is significant because searchprotocolhost.exe
  typically runs with specific command line arguments, and deviations from this norm
  can indicate malicious activity, such as Cobalt Strike usage. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow attackers to establish network connections for command
  and control, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present in small environments.
  Tuning may be required based on parent process.
