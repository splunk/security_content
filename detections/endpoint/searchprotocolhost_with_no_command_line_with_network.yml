datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies searchprotocolhost.exe with no command
  line arguments and with a network connection. It is unusual for searchprotocolhost.exe
  to execute with no command line arguments present. This particular behavior is common
  with malicious software, including Cobalt Strike. During investigation, identify
  any network connections and parallel processes. Identify any suspicious module loads
  related to credential dumping or file writes. searchprotocolhost.exe is natively
  found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name=searchprotocolhost.exe by _time span=1h  Processes.process_guid

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `ports` node.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present in small environments.
  Tuning may be required based on parent process.
