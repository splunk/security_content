description: This analytic is to look for possible execution of SysReq hack to reboot
  the Linux system host. This technique was seen in Awfulshred malware wiper to reboot
  the compromised host by using the linux magic sysreq key. This kernel configuration
  can trigger reboot by piping out 'b' to /proc/sysrq-trigger after enabling all the
  functions of sysrq. This TTP detection can be a good indicator of possible suspicious
  processes running on the Linux host since this command is not a common way to reboot
  a system.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN ("dash",
  "sudo", "bash")  Processes.process =  "* echo b &gt; *" Processes.process = "*/proc/sysrq-trigger"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name

  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_system_reboot_via_system_request_key_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
