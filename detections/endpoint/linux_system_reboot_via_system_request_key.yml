description: The following analytic detects the execution of the SysReq hack to reboot
  a Linux system host. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data to
  identify processes executing the command to pipe 'b' to /proc/sysrq-trigger. This
  activity is significant as it is an uncommon method to reboot a system and was observed
  in the Awfulshred malware wiper. If confirmed malicious, this technique could indicate
  the presence of suspicious processes and potential system compromise, leading to
  unauthorized reboots and disruption of services.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN ("dash",
  "sudo", "bash")  Processes.process =  "* echo b &gt; *" Processes.process = "*/proc/sysrq-trigger"
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `linux_system_reboot_via_system_request_key_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
