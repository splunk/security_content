description: The following analytic detects a CrowdStrike alert with MEDIUM severity indicates a potential threat that requires prompt attention. 
  This alert level suggests suspicious activity that may compromise security but is not immediately critical. 
  It typically involves detectable but non-imminent risks, such as unusual behavior or attempted policy violations, 
  which should be investigated further and mitigated quickly to prevent escalation of attacks.

how_to_implement: To implement CrowdStrike stream JSON logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, 
  authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "CrowdStrike:Event:Streams:JSON" event stream. 
  Process and store the JSON logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.

  manual_test: This detection is marked manual test because the attack_data file and 
    TA do not provide the event.EndpointIp and event.EndpointName fields.  event.EndpointName 
    is required to be present for the Risk Message Validation Integration Testing. 
    This will be investigated and is a tracked issue.
