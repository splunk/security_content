description: The following analytic detects a CrowdStrike alert with MEDIUM severity indicates a potential threat that requires prompt attention. 
  This alert level suggests suspicious activity that may compromise security but is not immediately critical. 
  It typically involves detectable but non-imminent risks, such as unusual behavior or attempted policy violations, 
  which should be investigated further and mitigated quickly to prevent escalation of attacks.

how_to_implement: To implement CrowdStrike stream JSON logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, 
  authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "CrowdStrike:Event:Streams:JSON" event stream. 
  Process and store the JSON logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.
