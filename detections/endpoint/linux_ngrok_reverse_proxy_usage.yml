description: The following analytic detects the use of Ngrok on a Linux operating system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments associated with Ngrok. This activity is significant because Ngrok can be used by adversaries to establish reverse proxies, potentially bypassing network defenses. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to create persistent, unauthorized access channels, facilitating data exfiltration or further exploitation of the compromised system.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=ngrok Processes.process IN ("*start*", "*--config*","*http*","*authtoken*", "*http*", "*tcp*") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_ngrok_reverse_proxy_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if Ngrok is an authorized utility. Filter as needed.
