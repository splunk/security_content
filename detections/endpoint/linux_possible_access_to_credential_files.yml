author: Teoderick Contreras, Splunk
type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to detect a possible attempt to dump or access the content
  of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline credential cracking. "etc/passwd"
  store user information within linux OS while "etc/shadow" contain the user passwords
  hash. Adversaries and threat actors may attempt to access this to gain persistence
  and/or privilege escalation. This anomaly detection can be a good indicator of possible
  credential dumping technique but it might catch some normal administrator automation
  scripts or during credential auditing. In this scenario filter is needed.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN("cat",
  "nano*","vim*", "vi*")  AND Processes.process IN("*/etc/shadow*", "*/etc/passwd*")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_possible_access_to_credential_files_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
