- Windows Event Log Security 4625
date: '2024-09-30'
description: The following analytic identifies a source host failing to authenticate against a remote host with 30 unique users. It leverages Windows Event 4625 with Logon Type 3, indicating remote authentication attempts. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges in an Active Directory environment. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of sensitive information. This detection is crucial for real-time security monitoring and threat hunting.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as as well as member servers and workstations. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid users against a remote host is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, remote administration tools, missconfigyred systems, etc.
