status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies a recently disclosed arbitraty command
  execution using Windows msdt.exe - a Diagnostics Troubleshooting Wizard. The sample
  identified will use the ms-msdt:/ protocol handler to load msdt.exe to retrieve
  a remote payload. During triage, review file modifications for html. Identify parallel
  process execution that may be related, including an Office Product.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=msdt.exe
  Processes.process IN ("*msdt*","*ms-msdt:*","*ms-msdt:/id*","*ms-msdt:-id*","*/id*")
  AND (Processes.process="*IT_BrowseForFile=*" OR Processes.process="*IT_RebrowseForFile=*"
  OR Processes.process="*.xml*") AND Processes.process="*PCWDiagnostic*" by Processes.dest

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed. Added .xml
  to potentially capture any answer file usage. Remove as needed.
