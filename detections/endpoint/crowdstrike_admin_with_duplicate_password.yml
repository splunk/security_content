description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for admin accounts with duplicate password risk, 
  identifying instances where administrative users share the same password. This practice significantly increases 
  the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches. Addressing these alerts promptly is crucial for maintaining 
  strong security protocols, ensuring each admin account uses a unique, secure password to protect critical systems and data.

how_to_implement: To implement crowdstrike:identities logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, 
  authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "crowdstrike:identities" event stream. 
  Process and store the logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.
