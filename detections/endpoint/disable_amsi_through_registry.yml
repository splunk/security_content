description: this search is to identify modification in registry to disable AMSI windows
  feature to evade detections. This technique was seen in several ransomware, RAT
  and even APT to impaire defenses of the compromise machine and to be able to execute
  payload with minimal alert as much as possible.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: network operator may disable this feature of windows but not
  so common.
