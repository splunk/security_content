description: The following analytic detects instances where the PaperCut NG application
  (pc-app.exe) spawns a Windows shell, such as cmd.exe or PowerShell. This behavior
  is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on
  process creation events where the parent process is pc-app.exe. This activity is
  significant as it may indicate an attacker attempting to gain unauthorized access
  or execute malicious commands on the system. If confirmed malicious, this could
  lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or further compromise
  of the affected environment.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=pc-app.exe
  `process_cmd` OR `process_powershell` OR Processes.process_name=java.exe by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_papercut_ng_spawn_shell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, but most likely not. Filter
  as needed.
