description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `net localgroup`
  command, which is used to enumerate local group memberships on a system. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution
  logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant because it
  can indicate an attacker is gathering information about local group memberships,
  potentially to identify privileged accounts. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could lead to further privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=net.exe
  OR Processes.process_name=net1.exe (Processes.process="*localgroup*") by Processes.dest

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune as needed.
