description: This analytic looks for suspicious commandline that modify the iptables firewall setting of a linux machine.
  This technique was seen in cyclopsblink malware where it modifies the firewall setting of the compromised machine to allow
  traffic to its tcp port that will be used to communicate with its C2 server.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: administrator may do this commandline for auditing and testing purposes.
  In this scenario filter is needed.
