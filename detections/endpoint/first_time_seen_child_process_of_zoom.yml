name: First Time Seen Child Process of Zoom

status: experimental
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies the first-time execution of child processes
  spawned by Zoom (zoom.exe or zoom.us). It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) data, specifically monitoring process creation events and comparing them against
  previously seen child processes. This activity is significant because the execution
  of unfamiliar child processes by Zoom could indicate malicious exploitation or misuse
  of the application. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code
  execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the endpoint.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: A new child process of zoom isn't malicious by that fact alone.
  Further investigation of the actions of the child process is needed to verify any
  malicious behavior is taken.
