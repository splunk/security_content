- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic detects the use of the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet,
  which allows PowerShell remoting on a local or remote computer. This detection leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104) to identify when this cmdlet is
  executed. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can indicate an attacker enabling
  remote command execution capabilities on a compromised system. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow an attacker to take control of the system remotely, execute
  commands, and potentially pivot to other systems within the network, leading to
  further compromise and lateral movement.

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `powershell_enable_powershell_remoting_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: Note that false positives may occur due to the use of the Enable-PSRemoting
  cmdlet by legitimate users, such as system administrators. It is recommended to
  apply appropriate filters as needed to minimize the number of false positives.
