description: This analytic focuses on identifying suspicious command-line parameters commonly associated with the use of Impacket wmiexec.py. Impacket is a set of Python classes designed for working with Microsoft network protocols, and it includes several scripts like wmiexec.py, smbexec.py, dcomexec.py, and atexec.py that enable command execution on remote endpoints. These scripts typically utilize administrative shares and hardcoded parameters, which can serve as signatures to detect their usage. Both Red Teams and adversaries may employ Impacket tools for lateral movement and remote code execution purposes. By monitoring for these specific command-line indicators, the analytic aims to detect potentially malicious activities related to Impacket tool usage.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=cmd.exe by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although uncommon, Administrators may leverage Impackets tools
  to start a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use
  cases.
