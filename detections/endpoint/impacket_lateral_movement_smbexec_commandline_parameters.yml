description: The following analytic identifies suspicious command-line parameters associated with the use of Impacket's smbexec.py for lateral movement. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line patterns indicative of Impacket tool usage. This activity is significant as both Red Teams and adversaries use Impacket for remote code execution and lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute commands on remote endpoints, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although uncommon, Administrators may leverage Impackets tools to start a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use cases.
