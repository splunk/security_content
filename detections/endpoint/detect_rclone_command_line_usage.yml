description: This analytic identifies commonly used command-line arguments used by
  `rclone.exe` to initiate a file transfer. Some arguments were negated as they are
  specific to the configuration used by adversaries. In particular, an adversary may
  list the files or directories of the remote file share using `ls` or `lsd`, which
  is not indicative of malicious behavior. During triage, at this stage of a ransomware
  event, exfiltration is about to occur or has already. Isolate the endpoint and continue
  investigating by review file modifications and parallel processes.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is restricted to
  the Rclone process name. Filter or tune the analytic as needed.
