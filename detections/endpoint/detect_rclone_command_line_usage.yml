datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This analytic identifies commonly used command-line arguments used by
  `rclone.exe` to initiate a file transfer. Some arguments were negated as they are
  specific to the configuration used by adversaries. In particular, an adversary may
  list the files or directories of the remote file share using `ls` or `lsd`, which
  is not indicative of malicious behavior. During triage, at this stage of a ransomware
  event, exfiltration is about to occur or has already. Isolate the endpoint and continue
  investigating by review file modifications and parallel processes.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process IN ("*copy*",
  "*mega*", "*pcloud*", "*ftp*", "*--config*", "*--progress*", "*--no-check-certificate*",
  "*--ignore-existing*", "*--auto-confirm*", "*--transfers*", "*--multi-thread-streams*")  by
  Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process   Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_rclone_command_line_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: There is potential for false positives as these arguments may
  be used by other applications. Filter or tune the analytic as needed.
