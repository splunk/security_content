description: The following analytic detects the usage of `rclone.exe` with specific
  command-line arguments indicative of file transfer activities. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
  and process details. This activity is significant as `rclone.exe` is often used
  by adversaries for data exfiltration, especially during ransomware attacks. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized data transfer, resulting in
  data breaches and potential loss of sensitive information. Immediate isolation of
  the affected endpoint and further investigation are recommended.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is restricted to
  the Rclone process name. Filter or tune the analytic as needed.
