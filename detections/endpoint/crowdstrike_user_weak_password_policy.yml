description: The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for weak password policy violations, 
  identifying instances where passwords do not meet the required security standards. 
  These alerts highlight potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, emphasizing the need 
  for stronger password practices. Addressing these alerts promptly helps to enhance overall security 
  and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

how_to_implement: To implement crowdstrike:identities logs, use the Falcon Streaming API. Set up an API client, 
  authenticate with your CrowdStrike credentials, and subscribe to the "crowdstrike:identities" event stream. 
  Process and store the logs as needed, integrating them into your logging or SIEM system for monitoring and analysis.
