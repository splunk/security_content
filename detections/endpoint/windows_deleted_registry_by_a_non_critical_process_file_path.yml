- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to detect deletion of registry with suspicious process file path. This technique was seen in Double Zero wiper malware 
  where it will delete all the subkey in HKLM, HKCU and HKU registry hive as part of its destructive payload to the targeted hosts. This anomaly detections 
  can catch possible malware or advesaries deleting registry as part of defense evasion or even payload impact but can also catch for third party application 
  updates or installation. In this scenario false positive filter is needed.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the offical
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
known_false_positives: This detection can catch for third party application 
  updates or installation. In this scenario false positive filter is needed.
