description: The following analytic detects the deletion of more than five unique
  Windows accounts within a 10-minute period, using Event Code 4726 from the Windows
  Security Event Log. It leverages the `wineventlog_security` dataset, segmenting
  data into 10-minute intervals to identify suspicious account deletions. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate an attacker attempting to erase traces of their
  actions. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access removal,
  hindering incident response and forensic investigations.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4726 status=success | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats count dc(user) as unique_users values(user) as user by EventCode signature
  _time src_user SubjectDomainName TargetDomainName Logon_ID | where unique_users
  > 5 | `windows_multiple_accounts_deleted_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events with the Windows TA. The Advanced Security Audit policy
  setting `Audit User Account Management` within `Account Management` needs to be
  enabled.
known_false_positives: Service accounts may be responsible for the creation, deletion
  or modification of accounts for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
