description: The following analytic flags when more than five unique Windows accounts are deleted within a 10-minute period, identified by Event Code 4726 in the Windows Security Event Log. Using the wineventlog_security dataset, it segments data into 10-minute intervals to monitor account deletions, a pattern that could suggest malicious intent like an attacker erasing traces. Teams should adjust the detection's threshold and timeframe to suit their specific environment.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4726 status=success
  | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats count dc(user) as unique_users values(user) as user by EventCode signature _time src_user SubjectDomainName TargetDomainName Logon_ID
  | where unique_users > 5
  | `windows_multiple_accounts_deleted_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events with the Windows TA. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit User Account Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Service accounts may be responsible for the creation, deletion or modification of accounts for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
