description: Credential extraction is often an illegal recovery of credential material
  from secured authentication resources and repositories. This process may also involve
  decryption or other transformations of the stored credential material. Native Microsoft
  debuggers, such as kd, ntkd, livekd and windbg, can be leveraged to read credential
  material directly from memory and process dumps.
eli5: This detection spots when native Microsoft debuggers ask for something inside
  the kernel (via ForceV1) while retrieving credentials.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Windows Security logs from devices of interest,
  including the event ID 4688 with enabled command line logging.

known_false_positives: Although unlikely, using debuggers this way may be indicative
  of developers analyzing crash dumps of their code. Note, even for developers this
  is an unusual way of working on code - debuggers are mostly used to step through
  code, not analyze its crash dumps.
