description: This analytic identifies the suspicious Remote Thread execution of rundll32.exe
  process to cmd.exe process. This technique was seen in IcedID malware to execute
  its malicious code in normal process for defense evasion and to steal sensitive
  information the the compromised host. browser process.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 SourceImage = "*\\rundll32.exe" TargetImage = "*.exe"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage TargetImage
  TargetProcessId SourceProcessId StartAddress EventCode Computer | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rundll32_create_remote_thread_to_a_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the SourceImage, TargetImage, and EventCode executions from your endpoints
  related to create remote thread or injecting codes. If you are using Sysmon, you
  must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
