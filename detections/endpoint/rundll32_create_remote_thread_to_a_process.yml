description: The following analytic detects the creation of a remote thread by rundll32.exe
  into another process. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 8 logs, specifically monitoring
  SourceImage and TargetImage fields. This activity is significant as it is a common
  technique used by malware, such as IcedID, to execute malicious code within legitimate
  processes, aiding in defense evasion and data theft. If confirmed malicious, this
  behavior could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges,
  and exfiltrate sensitive information from the compromised host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 8
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 SourceImage = "*\\rundll32.exe" TargetImage = "*.exe"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage TargetImage
  TargetProcessId SourceProcessId StartAddress EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `rundll32_create_remote_thread_to_a_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the SourceImage, TargetImage, and EventCode executions from your endpoints
  related to create remote thread or injecting codes. If you are using Sysmon, you
  must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
