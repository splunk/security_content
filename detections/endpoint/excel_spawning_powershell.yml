description: The following detection identifies Microsoft Excel spawning PowerShell.
  Typically, this is not common behavior and not default with Excel.exe. Excel.exe
  will generally be found in the following path `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16`
  (version will vary). PowerShell spawning from Excel.exe is common for a spearphishing
  attachment and is actively used. Albeit, the command executed will most likely be
  encoded and captured via another detection. During triage, review parallel processes
  and identify any files that may have been written.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.parent_process_name="excel.exe" `process_powershell` by Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.user Processes.dest Processes.original_file_name
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `excel_spawning_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present,
  filter as needed.
