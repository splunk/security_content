datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious child process, `rundll32.exe`,
  with no command-line arguments being spawned from `spoolsv.exe`. This was identified
  during our testing of CVE-2021-34527 previously (CVE-2021-1675) or PrintNightmare.
  Typically, this is not normal behavior for `spoolsv.exe` to spawn a process. During
  triage, isolate the endpoint and review for source of exploitation. Capture any
  additional file modification events.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=spoolsv.exe
  `process_rundll32` by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `spoolsv_spawning_rundll32_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives have been identified. There are limited
  instances where `rundll32.exe` may be spawned by a legitimate print driver.
