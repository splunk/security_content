description: The following analytic detects the spawning of `rundll32.exe` without command-line arguments by `spoolsv.exe`, which is unusual and potentially indicative of exploitation attempts like CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare). This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process creation events where `spoolsv.exe` is the parent process. This activity is significant as `spoolsv.exe` typically does not spawn other processes, and such behavior could indicate an active exploitation attempt. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence on the compromised endpoint.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives have been identified. There are limited instances where `rundll32.exe` may be spawned by a legitimate print driver.
