date: '2024-05-16'
description: 'The following analytic identifies a single source endpoint failing to
  authenticate with 30 unique users using the Kerberos protocol. It leverages EventCode
  4771 with Status 0x18, indicating wrong password attempts, and aggregates these
  events over a 5-minute window. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a
  Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or
  elevate privileges in an Active Directory environment. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential
  compromise of sensitive information.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid domain users
  is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, missconfigured systems and
  multi-user systems like Citrix farms.
