description: 'The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate
  with 30 unique users using the Kerberos protocol. This behavior could represent
  an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment
  using Kerberos to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Active Directory
  environments can be very different depending on the organization. Users should test
  this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed. Event 4771 is
  generated when the Key Distribution Center fails to issue a Kerberos Ticket Granting
  Ticket (TGT). Failure code 0x18 stands for `wrong password provided` (the attempted
  user is a legitimate domain user).\

  This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting
  exercises. This detection will only trigger on domain controllers, not on member
  servers or workstations.\

  The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by
  providing fields like source ip and attempted user accounts.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.

known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid domain users
  is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, missconfigured systems and
  multi-user systems like Citrix farms.
