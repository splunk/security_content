description: The following analytic identifies user accounts experiencing an excessive
  number of lockouts within a short timeframe. It leverages the 'Change' data model,
  specifically focusing on events where the result indicates a lockout. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate a brute-force attack or misconfiguration, both
  of which require immediate attention. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
  lead to account compromise, unauthorized access, and potential lateral movement
  within the network.

how_to_implement: ou must ingest your Windows security event logs in the `Change`
  datamodel under the nodename is `Account_Management`, for this search to execute
  successfully. Please consider updating the cron schedule and the count of lockouts
  you want to monitor, according to your environment.
known_false_positives: It is possible that a legitimate user is experiencing an issue
  causing multiple account login failures leading to lockouts.
