description: This search detects user accounts that have been locked out a relatively
  high number of times in a short period.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Change.All_Changes where nodename=All_Changes.Account_Management
  All_Changes.result="lockout" by All_Changes.user All_Changes.result |`drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")`
  |`drop_dm_object_name("Account_Management")`| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | search count > 5 | `detect_excessive_user_account_lockouts_filter`'
how_to_implement: ou must ingest your Windows security event logs in the `Change`
  datamodel under the nodename is `Account_Management`, for this search to execute
  successfully. Please consider updating the cron schedule and the count of lockouts
  you want to monitor, according to your environment.
known_false_positives: It is possible that a legitimate user is experiencing an issue
  causing multiple account login failures leading to lockouts.
