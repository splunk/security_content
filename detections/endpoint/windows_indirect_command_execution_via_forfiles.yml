description: The following analytic detects the execution of programs initiated by
  forfiles.exe. This command is typically used to run commands on multiple files,
  often within batch scripts. The detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where forfiles.exe
  is the parent process. This activity is significant because forfiles.exe can be
  exploited to bypass command line execution protections, making it a potential vector
  for malicious activity. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute
  arbitrary commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further system
  compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some legacy applications may be run using pcalua.exe. Similarly,
  forfiles.exe may be used in legitimate batch scripts.  Filter these results as needed.
