description: The following analytic identifies the process name of Java, Apache, or
  Tomcat spawning a Linux shell. This is potentially indicative of exploitation of
  the Java application and may be related to current event CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell).
  The shells included in the macro are "sh", "ksh", "zsh", "bash", "dash", "rbash",
  "fish", "csh', "tcsh', "ion", "eshell". Upon triage, review parallel processes and
  command-line arguments to determine legitimacy.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=java
  OR Processes.parent_process_name=apache OR Processes.parent_process_name=tomcat
  `linux_shells` by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_java_spawning_shell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Filtering may be required on internal developer build systems
  or classify assets as web facing and restrict the analytic based on asset type.
