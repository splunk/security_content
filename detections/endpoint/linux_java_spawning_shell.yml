description: The following analytic detects instances where Java, Apache, or Tomcat processes spawn a Linux shell, which may indicate exploitation attempts, such as those related to CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell). This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names and parent-child process relationships. This activity is significant as it can signify a compromised Java application, potentially leading to unauthorized shell access. If confirmed malicious, attackers could execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, or maintain persistent access, posing a severe threat to the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=java OR Processes.parent_process_name=apache OR Processes.parent_process_name=tomcat `linux_shells` by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_java_spawning_shell_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Filtering may be required on internal developer build systems or classify assets as web facing and restrict the analytic based on asset type.
