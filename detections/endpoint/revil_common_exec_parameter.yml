description: The following analytic detects the execution of command-line parameters
  commonly associated with REVIL ransomware, such as "-nolan", "-nolocal", "-fast",
  and "-full". It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process execution logs mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. This activity is significant because these parameters are indicative
  of ransomware attempting to encrypt files on a compromised machine. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to widespread data encryption, rendering critical files
  inaccessible and potentially causing significant operational disruption.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "* -nolan
  *" OR Processes.process = "* -nolocal *" OR Processes.process = "* -fast *" OR Processes.process
  = "* -full *" by Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `revil_common_exec_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: third party tool may have same command line parameters as revil
  ransomware.
