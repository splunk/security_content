description: This analytic identifies suspicious commandline parameter that are commonly
  used by REVIL ransomware to encrypts the compromise machine.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "* -nolan
  *" OR Processes.process = "* -nolocal *" OR Processes.process = "* -fast *" OR Processes.process
  = "* -full *" by Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `revil_common_exec_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: third party tool may have same command line parameters as revil
  ransomware.
