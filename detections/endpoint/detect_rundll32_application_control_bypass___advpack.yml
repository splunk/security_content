description: The following analytic identifies rundll32.exe loading advpack.dll and
  ieadvpack.dll by calling the LaunchINFSection function on the command line. This
  particular technique will load script code from a file. Upon a successful execution,
  the following module loads may occur - clr.dll, jscript.dll and scrobj.dll. During
  investigation, identify script content origination. Generally, a child process will
  spawn from rundll32.exe, but that may be bypassed based on script code contents.
  Rundll32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. During
  investigation, review any network connections and obtain the script content executed.
  It's possible other files are on disk.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=rundll32.exe
  Processes.process=*advpack* by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_rundll32_application_control_bypass___advpack_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use advpack.dll
  or ieadvpack.dll, triggering a false positive.
