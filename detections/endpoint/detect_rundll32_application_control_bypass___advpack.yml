description: The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe loading
  advpack.dll or ieadvpack.dll via the LaunchINFSection function. This method is identified
  using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line
  executions and process details. This activity is significant as it indicates a potential
  application control bypass, allowing script code execution from a file. If confirmed
  malicious, an attacker could execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to privilege
  escalation, persistence, or further network compromise. Investigate script content,
  network connections, and any spawned child processes for further context.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_rundll32` Processes.process=*advpack*

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use advpack.dll
  or ieadvpack.dll, triggering a false positive.
