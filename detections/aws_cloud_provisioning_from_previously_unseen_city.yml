description: 'This search looks for AWS provisioning activities from previously unseen
  cities.  Provisioning activities are defined broadly as any event that begins with
  "Run" or "Create." '
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen AWS Provisioning
  Activity Sources" support search once to create a history of previously seen locations
  that have provisioned AWS resources.

known_false_positives: "This is a strictly behavioral search, so we define \"false\
  \ positive\" slightly differently. Every time this fires, it will accurately reflect\
  \ the first occurrence in the time period you're searching within, plus what is\
  \ stored in the cache feature. But while there are really no \"false positives\"\
  \ in a traditional sense, there is definitely lots of noise.\\\n This search will\
  \ fire any time a new city is seen in the **GeoIP** database for any kind of provisioning\
  \ activity. If you typically do all provisioning from tools inside of your city,\
  \ there should be few false positives. If you are located in countries where the\
  \ free version of **MaxMind GeoIP** that ships by default with Splunk has weak resolution\
  \ (particularly small countries in less economically powerful regions), this may\
  \ be much less valuable to you."
