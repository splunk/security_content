description: This search provides information on anonymous Kubectl calls with IP,
  verb namespace and object access context
search: '`aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` userAgent=kubectl* sourceIPs{}!=127.0.0.1 sourceIPs{}!=::1
  src_user=system:anonymous  | table  src_ip src_user verb userAgent requestURI  |
  stats  count by src_ip src_user verb userAgent requestURI |`kubernetes_aws_detect_suspicious_kubectl_calls_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudwatch logs.
known_false_positives: Kubectl calls are not malicious by nature. However source IP,
  verb and Object can reveal potential malicious activity, specially anonymous suspicious
  IPs and sensitive objects such as configmaps or secrets
