description: This search finds for the number successfully destroyed cloud instances
  for every 4 hour block. This is split up between weekdays and the weekend. It then
  applies the probability densitiy model previously created and alerts on any outliers.
search: '| tstats count as instances_destroyed values(All_Changes.object_id) as object_id
  from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.action=deleted AND All_Changes.status=success
  AND All_Changes.object_category=instance by All_Changes.user _time span=1h | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")`
  | eval HourOfDay=strftime(_time, "%H") | eval HourOfDay=floor(HourOfDay/4)*4 | eval
  DayOfWeek=strftime(_time, "%w") | eval isWeekend=if(DayOfWeek >= 1 AND DayOfWeek
  <= 5, 0, 1) | join HourOfDay isWeekend [summary cloud_excessive_instances_destroyed_v1]
  | where cardinality >=16 | apply cloud_excessive_instances_destroyed_v1 threshold=0.005
  | rename "IsOutlier(instances_destroyed)" as isOutlier | where isOutlier=1 | eval
  expected_upper_threshold = mvindex(split(mvindex(BoundaryRanges, -1), ":"), 0) |

  table _time, user, instances_destroyed, expected_upper_threshold, distance_from_threshold,
  object_id | `abnormally_high_number_of_cloud_instances_destroyed_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs. You also must
  run the baseline search `Baseline Of Cloud Instances Destroyed` to create the probability
  density function.
known_false_positives: Many service accounts configured within a cloud infrastructure
  are known to exhibit this behavior. Please adjust the threshold values and filter
  out service accounts from the output. Always verify if this search alerted on a
  human user.
