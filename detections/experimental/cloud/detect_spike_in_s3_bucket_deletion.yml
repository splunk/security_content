description: This search detects users creating spikes in API activity related to
  deletion of S3 buckets in your AWS environment. It will also update the cache file
  that factors in the latest data.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit
  your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data
  points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine.
  The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from
  the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best
  when you run the "Baseline of S3 Bucket deletion activity by ARN" support search
  once to create a baseline of previously seen S3 bucket-deletion activity.
known_false_positives: Based on the values of`dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold`,
  the false positive rate may vary. Please modify this according the your environment.
