description: This search is to detect suspicious google drive or google docs files
  shared outside or externally. This behavior might be a good hunting query to monitor
  exfitration of data made by an attacker or insider to a targetted machine.
search: '`gsuite_drive` NOT (email IN("", "null")) | rex field=parameters.owner "[^@]+@(?<src_domain>[^@]+)"
  | rex field=email "[^@]+@(?<dest_domain>[^@]+)" | where src_domain = "internal_test_email.com"
  and not dest_domain = "internal_test_email.com" | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="low"
  | stats values(parameters.doc_title) as doc_title, values(parameters.doc_type) as
  doc_types, values(email) as dst_email_list, values(parameters.visibility) as visibility,
  values(parameters.doc_id) as doc_id, count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by parameters.owner ip_address phase severity  | rename parameters.owner
  as user ip_address as src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `gsuite_drive_share_in_external_email_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc. In order
  for the search to work for your environment, please edit the query to use your company
  specific email domain instead of `internal_test_email.com`.
known_false_positives: network admin or normal user may share files to customer and
  external team.
