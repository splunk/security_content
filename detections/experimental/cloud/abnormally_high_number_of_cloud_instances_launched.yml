description: This search finds for the number successfully created cloud instances
  for every 4 hour block. This is split up between weekdays and the weekend. It then
  applies the probability densitiy model previously created and alerts on any outliers.
search: '| tstats count as instances_launched values(All_Changes.object_id) as object_id
  from datamodel=Change where (All_Changes.action=created) AND All_Changes.status=success
  AND All_Changes.object_category=instance by All_Changes.user _time span=1h | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")`

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs. You also must
  run the baseline search `Baseline Of Cloud Instances Launched` to create the probability
  density function.
known_false_positives: Many service accounts configured within an AWS infrastructure
  are known to exhibit this behavior. Please adjust the threshold values and filter
  out service accounts from the output. Always verify if this search alerted on a
  human user.
