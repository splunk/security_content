description: This search looks at S3 bucket-access logs and detects new or previously
  unseen remote IP addresses that have successfully accessed an S3 bucket.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your S3 access
  logs' inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen S3 Bucket
  Access by Remote IP" support search once to create a history of previously seen
  remote IPs and bucket names.
known_false_positives: S3 buckets can be accessed from any IP, as long as it can make
  a successful connection. This will be a false postive, since the search is looking
  for a new IP within the past hour
