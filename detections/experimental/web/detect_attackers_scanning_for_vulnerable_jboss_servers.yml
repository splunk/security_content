version: 1
date: '2017-09-23'
author: Bhavin Patel, Splunk
type: TTP
datamodel:
- Web
description: This search looks for specific GET or HEAD requests to web servers that
  are indicative of reconnaissance attempts to identify vulnerable JBoss servers.
  JexBoss is described as the exploit tool of choice for this malicious activity.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Web where (Web.http_method="GET" OR Web.http_method="HEAD")
  AND (Web.url="*/web-console/ServerInfo.jsp*" OR Web.url="*web-console*" OR Web.url="*jmx-console*"
  OR Web.url = "*invoker*") by Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.src, Web.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_attackers_scanning_for_vulnerable_jboss_servers_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data from the web server or network traffic
  that contains web specific information, and populating the Web data model.
known_false_positives: It's possible for legitimate HTTP requests to be made to URLs
  containing the suspicious paths.
