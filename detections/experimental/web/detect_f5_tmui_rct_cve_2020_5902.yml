description: This search detects remote code exploit attempts on F5 BIG-IP, BIG-IQ,
  and Traffix SDC devices
how_to_implement: To consistently detect exploit attempts on F5 devices using the
  vulnerabilities contained within CVE-2020-5902 it is recommended to ingest logs
  via syslog.  As many BIG-IP devices will have SSL enabled on their management interfaces,
  detections via wire data may not pick anything up unless you are decrypting SSL
  traffic in order to inspect it.  I am using a regex string from a Cloudflare mitigation
  technique to try and always catch the offending string (..;), along with the other
  exploit of using (hsqldb;).
