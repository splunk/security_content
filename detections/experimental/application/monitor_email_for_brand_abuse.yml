description: This search looks for emails claiming to be sent from a domain similar
  to one that you want to have monitored for abuse.
how_to_implement: You need to ingest email header data. Specifically the sender's
  address (src_user) must be populated.  You also need to have run the search "ESCU
  - DNSTwist Domain Names", which creates the permutations of the domain that will
  be checked for.
