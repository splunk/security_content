- Splunk_Audit
description: 'The following analytic uses a pretrained machine learning text classifier to detect potentially risky commands. The model is trained independently and then the model file is packaged within ESCU for usage. A command is deemed risky based on the presence of certain trigger keywords, along with the context and the role of the user (please see references). The model uses custom features to predict whether a SPL is risky using text classification. The model takes as input the command text, user and search type and outputs a risk score between [0,1]. A high score indicates higher likelihood of a command being risky. This model is on-prem only.'

how_to_implement: This detection depends on the MLTK app which can be found here - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/ and the Splunk Audit datamodel which can be found here - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/. Additionally, you need to be ingesting logs which include Search_Activity.search, Search_Activity.user, Search_Activity.search_type from your endpoints. The risk score threshold should be adjusted based on the environment. The detection uses a custom MLTK model hence we need a few more steps for deployment, as outlined here - https://gist.github.com/ksharad-splunk/be2a62227966049047f5e5c4f2adcabb.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if suspicious behavior is observed, as determined by frequent usage of risky keywords.
