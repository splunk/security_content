description: 'The following analytic looks for one or more policy evaluation events in which multiple client values (IP, User Agent, etc.) change associated to the same Device Token for a specific user. A detection opportunity arises when an adversary attempts to reuse a stolen web session cookie. /

  * Retrieves policy evaluation events from successful authentication events. /

  * Aggregates/Groups by Device Token and User, providing the first policy evaluation event in the search window. / 

  * Evaluates whether there is more than one IP and whether there is more than one OS or browser for each combination of User/Device Token.'

how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta:im2 logs to be ingested.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on organization size and configuration of Okta.
