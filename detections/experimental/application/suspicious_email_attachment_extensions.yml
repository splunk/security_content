description: This search looks for emails that have attachments with suspicious file
  extensions.
how_to_implement: "You need to ingest data from emails. Specifically, the sender's\
  \ address and the file names of any attachments must be mapped to the Email data\
  \ model. \\\n **Splunk Phantom Playbook Integration**\\\nIf Splunk Phantom is also\
  \ configured in your environment, a Playbook called \"Suspicious Email Attachment\
  \ Investigate and Delete\" can be configured to run when any results are found by\
  \ this detection search. To use this integration, install the Phantom App for Splunk\
  \ `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/`, and add the correct hostname to the\
  \ \"Phantom Instance\" field in the Adaptive Response Actions when configuring this\
  \ detection search. The notable event will be sent to Phantom and the playbook will\
  \ gather further information about the file attachment and its network behaviors.\
  \ If Phantom finds malicious behavior and an analyst approves of the results, the\
  \ email will be deleted from the user's inbox."
