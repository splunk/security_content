description: Detect Okta user lockout events
search: '`okta` displayMessage="Max sign in attempts exceeded" | rename client.geographicalContext.country
  as country, client.geographicalContext.state as state, client.geographicalContext.city
  as city | table _time, user, country, state, city, src_ip | `okta_account_lockout_events_filter` '
how_to_implement: This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being
  ingested in your Splunk deployment.
known_false_positives: None. Account lockouts should be followed up on to determine
  if the actual user was the one who caused the lockout, or if it was an unauthorized
  actor.
