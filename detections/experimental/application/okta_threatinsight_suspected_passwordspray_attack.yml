description: The following analytic utilizes Okta's ThreatInsight to identify "PasswordSpray" and any included secondary outcome reasons. This event will trigger when a brute force attempt occurs with unknown usernames attempted.
search: '`okta` eventType="security.threat.detected" AND outcome.reason="Password Spray"
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(displayMessage) by eventType client.userAgent.rawUserAgent client.userAgent.browser outcome.reason
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `okta_threatinsight_suspected_passwordspray_attack_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be
  ingested in your Splunk deployment.
known_false_positives: Fidelity of this is high as it is Okta ThreatInsight. Filter and modify as needed.
