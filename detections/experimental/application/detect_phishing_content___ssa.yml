description: Malicious mails can conduct phishing that induces readers to open attachment,
  click links or trigger third party service. This detect uses Natural Language Processing
  (NLP) approach to analyze an email message's content (Sender, Subject and Body)
  and judge whether it is a phishing email. The detection adopts a deep learning (neural
  network) model that employs character level embeddings plus LSTM layers to perform
  classification. The model is pre-trained and then published as ONNX format. Current
  sample model is trained using the dataset published at https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/tree/master/datasets/T1566_Phishing_Email/splunk_train.json
  User are expected to re-train the model by combining with their own training data
  for better accuracy using the provided model file (SMLE notebook). DSP pipeline
  then processes the email message and passes it as an event to Apply ML Models function,
  which returns the probability of a phishing email. Current implementation assumes
  the email is fed to DSP in JSON format contains at least email's sender, subject
  and its message body, including reply content, if any.

how_to_implement: Events are fed to DSP contains at least email's sender, subject
  and its message body.
known_false_positives: Because of imbalance of anomaly data in training, the model
  will less likely report false positive. Instead, the model is more prone to false
  negative. Current best recall score is ~85%
