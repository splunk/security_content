description: Attackers often use spaces as a means to obfuscate an attachment's file
  extension. This search looks for messages with email attachments that have many
  spaces within the file names.
how_to_implement: "You need to ingest data from emails. Specifically, the sender's\
  \ address and the file names of any attachments must be mapped to the Email data\
  \ model. The threshold ratio is set to 10%, but this value can be configured to\
  \ suit each environment. \\\n **Splunk Phantom Playbook Integration**\\\nIf Splunk\
  \ Phantom is also configured in your environment, a playbook called \"Suspicious\
  \ Email Attachment Investigate and Delete\" can be configured to run when any results\
  \ are found by this detection search. To use this integration, install the Phantom\
  \ App for Splunk `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/` and add the correct hostname\
  \ to the \"Phantom Instance\" field in the Adaptive Response Actions when configuring\
  \ this detection search. The notable event will be sent to Phantom and the playbook\
  \ will gather further information about the file attachment and its network behaviors.\
  \ If Phantom finds malicious behavior and an analyst approves of the results, the\
  \ email will be deleted from the user's inbox."
