- Updates
description: This search looks for Windows endpoints that have not generated an event
  indicating a successful Windows update in the last 60 days. Windows updates are
  typically released monthly and applied shortly thereafter. An endpoint that has
  not successfully applied an update in this time frame indicates the endpoint is
  not regularly being patched for some reason.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Updates
  where Updates.status=Installed Updates.vendor_product="Microsoft Windows" by Updates.dest
  Updates.status Updates.vendor_product | rename Updates.dest as Host | rename Updates.status
  as "Update Status" | rename Updates.vendor_product as Product | eval isOutlier=if(lastTime
  <= relative_time(now(), "-60d@d"), 1, 0)  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`  |
  search isOutlier=1 | rename lastTime as "Last Update Time", | table Host, "Update
  Status", Product, "Last Update Time" | `no_windows_updates_in_a_time_frame_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, it requires that the 'Update'
  data model is being populated. This can be accomplished by ingesting Windows events
  or the Windows Update log via a universal forwarder on the Windows endpoints you
  wish to monitor. The Windows add-on should be also be installed and configured to
  properly parse Windows events in Splunk. There may be other data sources which can
  populate this data model, including vulnerability management systems.
