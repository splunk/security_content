description: The search looks at the change-analysis data model and detects email
  files created outside the normal Outlook directory.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Filesystem.file_path)
  as file_path min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records the file-system activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint.Filesystem
  data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black, or by other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report file-system
  reads and writes.
known_false_positives: Administrators and users sometimes prefer backing up their
  email data by moving the email files into a different folder. These attempts will
  be detected by the search.
