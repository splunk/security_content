description: This search looks for suspicious Java classes that are often used to
  exploit remote command execution in common Java frameworks, such as Apache Struts.
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from your web-traffic appliances that serve or sit in the path of your Struts application
  servers. This can be accomplished by indexing data from a web proxy, or by using
  network traffic-analysis tools, such as Splunk Stream or Bro.
