description: This search looks for suspicious Java classes that are often used to
  exploit remote command execution in common Java frameworks, such as Apache Struts.
search: '`stream_http` http_method=POST http_content_length>1 | regex form_data="(?i)java\.lang\.(?:runtime|processbuilder)"
  | rename src_ip as src | stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime, latest(_time)
  as lastTime, values(url) as uri, values(status) as status, values(http_user_agent)
  as http_user_agent by src, dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_java_classes_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from your web-traffic appliances that serve or sit in the path of your Struts application
  servers. This can be accomplished by indexing data from a web proxy, or by using
  network traffic-analysis tools, such as Splunk Stream or Bro.
known_false_positives: There are no known false positives.
