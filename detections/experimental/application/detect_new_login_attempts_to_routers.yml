type: TTP
datamodel:
- Authentication
description: The search queries the authentication logs for assets that are categorized
  as routers in the ES Assets and Identity Framework, to identify connections that
  have not been seen before in the last 30 days.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count earliest(_time) as earliest
  latest(_time) as latest from datamodel=Authentication where Authentication.dest_category=router
  by Authentication.dest Authentication.user| eval isOutlier=if(earliest >= relative_time(now(),
  "-30d@d"), 1, 0) | where isOutlier=1| `security_content_ctime(earliest)`| `security_content_ctime(latest)`
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Authentication")` | `detect_new_login_attempts_to_routers_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ensure the network
  router devices are categorized as "router" in the Assets and identity table. You
  must also populate the Authentication data model with logs related to users authenticating
  to routing infrastructure.
known_false_positives: Legitimate router connections may appear as new connections
