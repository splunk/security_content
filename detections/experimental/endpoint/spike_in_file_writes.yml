description: The search looks for a sharp increase in the number of files written
  to a particular host
how_to_implement: In order to implement this search, you must populate the Endpoint
  file-system data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection
  and response products, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads
  and writes to the file system.

known_false_positives: It is important to understand that if you happen to install
  any new applications on your hosts or are copying a large number of files, you can
  expect to see a large increase of file modifications.
