how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You should run
  the baseline search `Previously Seen Zoom Child Processes - Initial` to build the
  initial table of child processes and hostnames for this search to work. You should
  also schedule at the same interval as this search the second baseline search `Previously
  Seen Zoom Child Processes - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out
  old child processes. Please update the `previously_seen_zoom_child_processes_window`
  macro to adjust the time window.
known_false_positives: A new child process of zoom isn't malicious by that fact alone.
  Further investigation of the actions of the child process is needed to verify any
  malicious behavior is taken.
