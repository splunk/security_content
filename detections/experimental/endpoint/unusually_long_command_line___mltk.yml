description: Command lines that are extremely long may be indicative of malicious
  activity on your hosts. This search leverages the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK)
  to help identify command lines with lengths that are unusual for a given user.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes by Processes.user Processes.dest Processes.process_name
  Processes.process | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| eval processlen=len(process) | search user!=unknown
  | apply cmdline_pdfmodel threshold=0.01 | rename "IsOutlier(processlen)" as isOutlier
  | search isOutlier > 0 | table firstTime lastTime user dest process_name process
  processlen count | `unusually_long_command_line___mltk_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that monitors command lines
  and populates the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments
  are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data model. In addition, MLTK
  version >= 4.2 must be installed on your search heads, along with any required dependencies.
  Finally, the support search "Baseline of Command Line Length - MLTK" must be executed
  before this detection search, as it builds an ML model over the historical data
  used by this search. It is important that this search is run in the same app context
  as the associated support search, so that the model created by the support search
  is available for use. You should periodically re-run the support search to rebuild
  the model with the latest data available in your environment.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications use long command lines for installs
  or updates. You should review identified command lines for legitimacy. You may modify
  the first part of the search to omit legitimate command lines from consideration.
  If you are seeing more results than desired, you may consider changing the value
  of threshold in the search to a smaller value. You should also periodically re-run
  the support search to re-build the ML model on the latest data. You may get unexpected
  results if the user identified in the results is not present in the data used to
  build the associated model.
