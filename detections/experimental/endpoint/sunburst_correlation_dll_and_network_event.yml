description: The malware sunburst will load the malicious dll by SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe.
  After a period of 12-14 days, the malware will attempt to resolve a subdomain of
  avsvmcloud.com. This detections will correlate both events.
how_to_implement: This detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 7, Driver
  loaded. Please tune your sysmon config that you DriverLoad event for SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll
  is captured by Sysmon. Additionally, you need sysmon logs for Event ID 22, DNS Query.
  We suggest to run this detection at least once a day over the last 14 days.
