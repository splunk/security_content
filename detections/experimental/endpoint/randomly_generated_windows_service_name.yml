description: The following hunting analytic leverages Event ID 7045, `A new service
  was installed in the system`, to identify the installation of a Windows Service
  with a suspicious, high entropy, Service Name. To achieve this, this analytic also
  leverages the `ut_shannon` function from the URL ToolBox Splunk application. Red
  teams and adversaries alike may abuse the Service Control Manager to create and
  start a remote Windows Service and obtain remote code execution. To achieve this
  goal, some tools like Metasploit, Cobalt Strike and Impacket, typically create a
  Windows Service with a random service name on the victim host. This hunting analytic
  may help defenders identify Windows Services installed as part of a lateral movement
  attack. The entropy threshold `ut_shannon > 3` should be customized by users. The
  Service_File_Name field can be used to determine if the Windows Service has malicious
  intent or not.
search: ' `wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 | lookup ut_shannon_lookup word as Service_Name
  | where ut_shannon > 3 | table EventCode ComputerName Service_Name ut_shannon Service_Start_Type
  Service_Type Service_File_Name | `randomly_generated_windows_service_name_filter` '
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type
  from your endpoints. The Windows TA as well as the URL ToolBox application are also
  required.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may use random Windows Service names.
