- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies the use of a curl contacting suspicious
  remote domains to checkin to command and control servers or download further implants.
  In the context of Silver Sparrow, curl is identified contacting s3.amazonaws.com.
  This particular behavior is common with MacOS adware-malicious software.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=curl
  Processes.process=s3.amazonaws.com by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_curl_network_connection_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Filter as needed.
