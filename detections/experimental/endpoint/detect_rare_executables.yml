description: This search will return a table of rare processes, the names of the systems
  running them, and the users who initiated each process.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.dest) as
  dest values(Processes.user) as user min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes by Processes.process_name  | rename Processes.process_name
  as process | rex field=user "(?<user_domain>.*)\\\\(?<user_name>.*)" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| search [| tstats count from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  by Processes.process_name | rare Processes.process_name limit=30 | rename Processes.process_name
  as process| `filter_rare_process_allow_list`| table process ] | `detect_rare_executables_filter` '
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts and populating the endpoint data model
  with the resultant dataset. The macro `filter_rare_process_allow_list` searches
  two lookup files for allowed processes.  These consist of `rare_process_allow_list_default.csv`
  and `rare_process_allow_list_local.csv`. To add your own processes to the allow
  list, add them to `rare_process_allow_list_local.csv`. If you wish to remove an
  entry from the default lookup file, you will have to modify the macro itself to
  set the allow_list value for that process to false. You can modify the limit parameter
  and search scheduling to better suit your environment.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate processes may be only rarely executed in your
  environment. As these are identified, update `rare_process_allow_list_local.csv`
  to filter them out of your search results.
