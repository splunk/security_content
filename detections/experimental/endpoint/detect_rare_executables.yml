description: This search will return a table of processes in the a given window, remove process names which are in the allowed list and list out the top 30 rare processes discovered on different hosts.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts and populating the `Endpoint` data model
  with the resultant dataset. The macro `filter_rare_process_allow_list` searches
  two lookup files for allowed processes.  These consist of `rare_process_allow_list_default.csv`
  and `rare_process_allow_list_local.csv`. To add your own processes to the allow
  list, add them to `rare_process_allow_list_local.csv`. If you wish to remove an
  entry from the default lookup file, you will have to modify the macro itself to
  set the allow_list value for that process to false. You can modify the limit parameter
  and search scheduling to better suit your environment.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate processes may be only rarely executed in your
  environment. As these are identified, update `rare_process_allow_list_local.csv`
  to filter them out of your search results.
