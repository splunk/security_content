description: This search looks for processes in an MacOS system that is tapping keyboard
  events in MacOS, and essentially monitoring all keystrokes made by a user. This
  is a common technique used by RATs to log keystrokes from a victim, although it
  can also be used by legitimate processes like Siri to react on human input
search: '| from datamodel Alerts.Alerts | search app=osquery:results name=pack_osx-attacks_Keyboard_Event_Taps
  | rename columns.cmdline as cmd, columns.name as process_name, columns.pid as process_id|
  dedup host,process_name | table host,process_name, cmd, process_id | `processes_tapping_keyboard_events_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from your osquery deployed agents with the [osx-attacks.conf](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/blob/experimental/packs/osx-attacks.conf#L599)
  pack enabled. Also the [TA-OSquery](https://github.com/d1vious/TA-osquery) must
  be deployed across your indexers and universal forwarders in order to have the osquery
  data populate the Alerts data model.
known_false_positives: There might be some false positives as keyboard event taps
  are used by processes like Siri and Zoom video chat, for some good examples of processes
  to exclude please see [this](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/pull/5345#issuecomment-454639161)
