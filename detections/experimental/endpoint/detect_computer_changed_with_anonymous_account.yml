description: This search looks for Event Code 4742 (Computer Change) or EventCode
  4624 (An account was successfully logged on) with an anonymous account.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4742 TargetUserName="ANONYMOUS
  LOGON" LogonType=3 | stats count values(host) as host, values(TargetDomainName)
  as Domain, values(user) as user | `detect_computer_changed_with_anonymous_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requires audit computer account management to be enabled
  on the system in order to generate Event ID 4742. We strongly recommend that you
  specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.)
  for Windows Event Logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations for your
  Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter
  out known false positives.
known_false_positives: None thus far found
