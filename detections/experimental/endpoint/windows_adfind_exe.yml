description: 'This search looks for the execution of `adfind.exe` with command-line
  arguments that it uses by default. Specifically the filter or search functions.
  It also considers the arguments necessary like objectcategory, see readme for more
  details: https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/usage.htm. This has been
  seen used before by Wizard Spider, FIN6 and actors whom also launched SUNBURST.
  AdFind.exe is usually used a recon tool to enumare a domain controller.'
search: ' | tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process=*-f*
  OR Processes.process=*-b*) AND (Processes.process=*objectcategory* OR Processes.process=*-gcb*
  OR Processes.process=*-sc*) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_name
  Processes.process  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_adfind_exe_filter` '
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If
  you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: administrators rarely use adfind, usually not used for legitimate
  reasons
