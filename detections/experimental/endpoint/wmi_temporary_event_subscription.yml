description: This search looks for the creation of WMI temporary event subscriptions.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting the
  Windows WMI activity logs. This can be done by adding a stanza to inputs.conf on
  the system generating logs with a title of [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational].
id: 38cbd42c-1098-41bb-99cf-9d6d2b296d83
known_false_positives: Some software may create WMI temporary event subscriptions
  for various purposes. The included search contains an exception for two of these
  that occur by default on Windows 10 systems. You may need to modify the search to
  create exceptions for other legitimate events.
