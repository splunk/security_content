description: This search looks for the creation of WMI temporary event subscriptions.
search: '`wmi` EventCode=5860 Temporary | rex field=Message "NotificationQuery =\s+(?<query>[^;|^$]+)"
  | search query!="SELECT * FROM Win32_ProcessStartTrace WHERE ProcessName = ''wsmprovhost.exe''"
  AND query!="SELECT * FROM __InstanceOperationEvent WHERE TargetInstance ISA ''AntiVirusProduct''
  OR TargetInstance ISA ''FirewallProduct'' OR TargetInstance ISA ''AntiSpywareProduct''"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName, query  |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wmi_temporary_event_subscription_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting the
  Windows WMI activity logs. This can be done by adding a stanza to inputs.conf on
  the system generating logs with a title of [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational].
known_false_positives: Some software may create WMI temporary event subscriptions
  for various purposes. The included search contains an exception for two of these
  that occur by default on Windows 10 systems. You may need to modify the search to
  create exceptions for other legitimate events.
