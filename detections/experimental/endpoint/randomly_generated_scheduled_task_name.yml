datamodel: []
description: The following hunting analytic leverages Event ID 4698, `A scheduled
  task was created`, to identify the creation of a Scheduled Task with a suspicious,
  high entropy, Task Name. To achieve this, this analytic also leverages the `ut_shannon`
  function from the URL ToolBox Splunk application. Red teams and adversaries alike
  may abuse the Task Scheduler to create and start a remote Scheduled Task and obtain
  remote code execution. To achieve this goal, tools like Impacket or Crapmapexec,
  typically create a Scheduled Task with a random task name on the victim host. This
  hunting analytic may help defenders identify Scheduled Tasks created as part of
  a lateral movement attack. The entropy threshold `ut_shannon > 3` should be customized
  by users. The Command field can be used to determine if the task has malicious intent
  or not.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698 | xmlkv Message | lookup ut_shannon_lookup
  word as Task_Name | where ut_shannon > 3 | table  _time, dest, Task_Name, ut_shannon,
  Command, Author, Enabled, Hidden | `randomly_generated_scheduled_task_name_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA as well
  as the URL ToolBox application are also required.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may use random Scheduled Task names.
