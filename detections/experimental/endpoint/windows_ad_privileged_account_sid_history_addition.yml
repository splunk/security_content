description: This detection identifies when the SID of a privileged user is added to
 the SID History attribute of another user. Useful for tracking SID history abuse 
 across multiple domains. This detection leverages the Asset and Identities 
 framework. See the implementation section for further details on configuration.

how_to_implement: Ensure you have objectSid and the Down Level Logon Name `DOMAIN\sAMACountName`
 added to the identity field of your Asset and Identities lookup, along with the 
 category of privileged for the applicable users. Ensure you are 
 ingesting eventcodes 4742 and 4738. Two advanced audit policies 
 `Audit User Account Management` and `Audit Computer Account Management` under 
 `Account Management` are required to generate these event codes. 
known_false_positives: Migration of privileged accounts.
