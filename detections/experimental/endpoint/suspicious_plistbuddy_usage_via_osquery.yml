description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of a native MacOS utility, PlistBuddy, creating or modifying a properly list (.plist) file. In the instance of Silver Sparrow,
  the following commands were executed:\
   
  - PlistBuddy -c "Add :Label string init_verx" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist \

  - PlistBuddy -c "Add :RunAtLoad bool true" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist \

  - PlistBuddy -c "Add :StartInterval integer 3600" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist \

  - PlistBuddy -c "Add :ProgramArguments array" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist \

  - PlistBuddy -c "Add :ProgramArguments:0 string /bin/sh" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist \
  
  - PlistBuddy -c "Add :ProgramArguments:1 string -c" ~/Library/Launchagents/init_verx.plist \
  
  Upon triage, capture the property list file being written to disk and review for further indicators. Contain the endpoint and triage further.'
how_to_implement: OSQuery must be installed and configured to pick up process events (info
  at https://osquery.io) as well as using the Splunk OSQuery Add-on https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4402. Modify the macro and validate fields are correct.

known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications may use PlistBuddy to create or modify property lists and possibly generate false positives. Review the property list being modified or created to confirm.
