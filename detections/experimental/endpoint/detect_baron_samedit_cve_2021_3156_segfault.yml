description: This search detects the heap-based buffer overflow of sudoedit
how_to_implement: Splunk Universal Forwarder running on Linux systems (tested on Centos
  and Ubuntu), where segfaults are being logged.  This also captures instances where
  the exploit has been compiled into a binary. The detection looks for greater than
  5 instances of sudoedit combined with segfault over your search time period on a
  single host
id: 10f2bae0-bbe6-4984-808c-37dc1c67980d
known_false_positives: If sudoedit is throwing segfaults for other reasons this will
  pick those up too.
