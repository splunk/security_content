description: The following analytic identifies suspicious processes spawning from
  WinRM (wsmprovhost.exe). This analytic is related to potential exploitation of CVE-2021-31166.
  which is a kernel-mode device driver http.sys vulnerability. Current proof of concept
  code will blue-screen the operating system. However, http.sys used by many different
  Windows processes, including WinRM. In this case, identifying suspicious process
  create (child processes) from `wsmprovhost.exe` is what this analytic is identifying.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=wsmprovhost.exe
  Processes.process_name IN ("cmd.exe","sh.exe","bash.exe","powershell.exe","pwsh.exe","schtasks.exe","certutil.exe","whoami.exe","bitsadmin.exe","scp.exe")
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `winrm_spawning_a_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Add new processes or filter as needed. It is possible
  system management software may spawn processes from `wsmprovhost.exe`.
