description: 'The following hunting analytic leverages Event ID 4624, `An account
  was successfully logged on`, to identify an unusual number of remote authentication
  attempts coming from one source. An endpoint authenticating to a large number of
  remote endpoints could represent malicious behavior like lateral movement, malware
  staging, reconnaissance, etc.\

  The detection calculates the standard deviation for each host and leverages the
  3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual high number of authentication events.
  To customize this analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket`
  span time,  the calculation of the `upperBound` field as well as the Outlier calculation.
  This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting
  exercises.\'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers aas well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: An single endpoint authenticating to a large number of hosts
  is not common behavior. Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited
  to vulnerability scanners, jump servers and missconfigured systems.
