description: This search looks for cleartext protocols at risk of leaking credentials.
  Currently, this consists of legacy protocols such as telnet, POP3, IMAP, and non-anonymous
  FTP sessions. While some of these protocols can be used over SSL, they typically
  run on different assigned ports in those cases.
how_to_implement: This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic, and
  populating the Network_Traffic data model.

  this is rare.
