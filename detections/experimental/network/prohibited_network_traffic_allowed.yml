description: This search looks for network traffic defined by port and transport layer
  protocol in the Enterprise Security lookup table "lookup_interesting_ports", that
  is marked as prohibited, and has an associated 'allow' action in the Network_Traffic
  data model. This could be indicative of a misconfigured network device.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.action = allowed by
  All_Traffic.src_ip All_Traffic.dest_ip All_Traffic.dest_port All_Traffic.action
  | lookup update=true interesting_ports_lookup dest_port as All_Traffic.dest_port
  OUTPUT app is_prohibited note transport | search is_prohibited=true | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")` | `prohibited_network_traffic_allowed_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from firewalls or other network control devices that mediate the traffic allowed
  into an environment. This is necessary so that the search can identify an 'action'
  taken on the traffic of interest. The search requires the Network_Traffic data model
  be populated.
