  your email server.

how_to_implement: This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and
  populating the Network_Traffic data model.  Your email servers must be categorized
  as "email_server" for the search to work, as well. You may need to adjust the deviation_threshold
  and minimum_data_samples values based on the network traffic in your environment.
  The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation
  you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number
  of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.
known_false_positives: The false-positive rate will vary based on how you set the
  deviation_threshold and data_samples values. Our recommendation is to adjust these
  values based on your network traffic to and from your email servers.
