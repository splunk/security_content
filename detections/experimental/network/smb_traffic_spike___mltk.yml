  in the number of Server Message Block (SMB) connections.

how_to_implement: 'To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure
  that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. In addition, the
  Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version 4.2 or greater must be installed on your
  search heads, along with any required dependencies. Finally, the support search
  "Baseline of SMB Traffic - MLTK" must be executed before this detection search,
  because it builds a machine-learning (ML) model over the historical data used by
  this search. It is important that this search is run in the same app context as
  the associated support search, so that the model created by the support search is
  available for use. You should periodically re-run the support search to rebuild
  the model with the latest data available in your environment.\

  This search produces a field (Number of events,count) that are not yet supported
  by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised.
  This field contributes additional context to the notable. To see the additional
  metadata, add the following field, if not already present, to Incident Review -
  Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add
  New Entry): \

  1. **Label:** Number of events, **Field:** count\

  Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review is found
  here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`'
known_false_positives: If you are seeing more results than desired, you may consider
  reducing the value of the threshold in the search. You should also periodically
  re-run the support search to re-build the ML model on the latest data. Please update
  the `smb_traffic_spike_mltk_filter` macro to filter out false positive results
