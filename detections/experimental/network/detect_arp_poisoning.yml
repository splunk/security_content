description: By enabling Dynamic ARP Inspection as a Layer 2 Security measure on the
  organization's network devices, we will be able to detect ARP Poisoning attacks
  in the Infrastructure.
search: '`cisco_networks` facility="PM" mnemonic="ERR_DISABLE" disable_cause="arp-inspection"
  | eval src_interface=src_int_prefix_long+src_int_suffix | stats min(_time) AS firstTime
  max(_time) AS lastTime count BY host src_interface | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `detect_arp_poisoning_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must be configured with DHCP Snooping (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-0_2_EX/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg_chapter_01101.html)
  and Dynamic ARP Inspection (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-2_2_e/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg_chapter_01111.html)
  and log with a severity level of minimum "5 - notification". The search also requires
  that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)
  is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.
known_false_positives: This search might be prone to high false positives if DHCP
  Snooping or ARP inspection has been incorrectly configured, or if a device normally
  sends many ARP packets (unlikely).
