description: Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device
  operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. TFTP boot
  (netbooting) is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled
  network device images from a centralized management server. Netbooting is one option
  in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images.

how_to_implement: This search looks for Network Traffic events to TFTP, FTP or SSH/SCP
  ports from network devices. Make sure to tag any network devices as network, router
  or switch in order for this detection to work. If the TFTP traffic doesn't traverse
  a firewall nor packet inspection, these events will not be logged. This is typically
  an issue if the TFTP server is on the same subnet as the network device. There is
  also a chance of the network device loading software using a DHCP assigned IP address
  (netboot) which is not in the Asset inventory.
known_false_positives: This search will also report any legitimate attempts of software
  downloads to network devices as well as outbound SSH sessions from network devices.
