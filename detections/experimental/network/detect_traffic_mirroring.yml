description: Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data
  exfiltration over compromised network infrastructure. Traffic mirroring is a native
  feature for some network devices and used for network analysis and may be configured
  to duplicate traffic and forward to one or more destinations for analysis by a network
  analyzer or other monitoring device.
search: '`cisco_networks` (facility="MIRROR" mnemonic="ETH_SPAN_SESSION_UP") OR (facility="SPAN"
  mnemonic="SESSION_UP") OR (facility="SPAN" mnemonic="PKTCAP_START") OR (mnemonic="CFGLOG_LOGGEDCMD"
  command="monitor session*") | stats min(_time) AS firstTime max(_time) AS lastTime
  count BY host facility mnemonic | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_traffic_mirroring_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network
  devices. The network devices must log with a severity level of minimum "5 - notification".
  The search also requires that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)
  is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices and that the devices have
  been configured according to the documentation of the Cisco Networks Add-on. Also
  note that an attacker may disable logging from the device prior to enabling traffic
  mirroring.
known_false_positives: This search will return false positives for any legitimate
  traffic captures by network administrators.
