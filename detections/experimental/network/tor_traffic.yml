description: This search looks for network traffic identified as The Onion Router
  (TOR), a benign anonymity network which can be abused for a variety of nefarious
  purposes.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.app=tor AND All_Traffic.action=allowed
  by All_Traffic.src_ip All_Traffic.dest_ip All_Traffic.dest_port All_Traffic.action
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Traffic")`
  | `tor_traffic_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from firewalls or other network control devices that mediate the traffic allowed
  into an environment. This is necessary so that the search can identify an 'action'
  taken on the traffic of interest. The search requires the Network_Traffic data model
  be populated.
