name: Zeek x509 Certificate with Punycode

description: The following analytic utilizes the Zeek x509 log. Modify the zeek_x509 macro with your index and sourcetype as needed. You will need to ensure the full x509 is logged as the potentially malicious punycode is nested under subject alternative names.
  In this particular analytic, it will identify punycode within the subject alternative name email and other fields. Note, that OtherFields is meant to be BOOL (true,false), therefore we may never see xn-- in that field. 
  Upon identifying punycode, manually copy and paste, or add CyberChef recipe to query, and decode the punycode manually.
search: '`zeek_x509`
  | rex field=san.email{} "\@(?<domain_detected>xn--.*)"
  | rex field=san.other_fields{} "\@(?<domain_detected>xn--.*)"
  | stats values(domain_detected) by  basic_constraints.ca source host
  | `zeek_x509_certificate_with_punycode_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic requires x509 certificate data to be logged entirely. In particular, for CVE-2022-3602, the punycode will be within the leaf certificate. The analytic may be modified to look for all xn--, or utilize a network IDS/monitoring tool like Zeek or Suricata to drill down into cert captured. Note for Suricata, the certificate is base64 encoded and will need to be decoded to capture the punycode (punycode will need to be decoded after).
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization works with international businesses. Filter as needed.
