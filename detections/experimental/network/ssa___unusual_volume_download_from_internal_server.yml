description: Insider might conduct information collection before data exfiltration, and unusual volume of data
  download from internal server is an indicator of such potential threat. This detection evaluates the total 
  bytes downloaded from internal servers at specific time window per entity level, and then flagged these that 
  are higher than 99.999% percentile as an anamaly. A behavior will be reported as long as the downloaded byte 
  volume is unusual even though that operation is benigh, which causes false positive. It is therefore advised 
  to adjust threshold and time window based on detection performance whenever necessary. It should be noted that 
  seasonality is not modeled in the current approach.

how_to_implement: Ingest PAN traffic logs 
known_false_positives: Benign large volume data download might be flagged as (false) positive.
