description: The search is used to identify attempts to use your DNS Infrastructure
  for DDoS purposes via a DNS amplification attack leveraging ANY queries.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you must ensure that DNS data
  is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
id: 8fa891f7-a533-4b3c-af85-5aa2e7c1f1eb
known_false_positives: Legitimate ANY requests may trigger this search, however it
  is unusual to see a large volume of them under typical circumstances. You may modify
  the threshold in the search to better suit your environment.
