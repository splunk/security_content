author: Bhavin Patel, Splunk
type: Anomaly
datamodel:
- Network_Resolution
description: The search is used to identify attempts to use your DNS Infrastructure
  for DDoS purposes via a DNS amplification attack leveraging ANY queries.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Resolution
  where nodename=DNS "DNS.message_type"="QUERY" "DNS.record_type"="ANY" by "DNS.dest"
  | `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")` | where count>200 | `large_volume_of_dns_any_queries_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you must ensure that DNS data
  is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
known_false_positives: Legitimate ANY requests may trigger this search, however it
  is unusual to see a large volume of them under typical circumstances. You may modify
  the threshold in the search to better suit your environment.
