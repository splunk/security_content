  Legitimate DNS servers should be identified in the Enterprise Security Assets and
  Identity Framework.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you will need to ensure that
  DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. It also requires that
  your DNS servers are identified correctly in the Assets and Identity table of Enterprise
  Security.
