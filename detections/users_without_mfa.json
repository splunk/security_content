We then filter out all the known AWS service accounts since service accounts typically do not have MFA enabled. The search then creates a table of the first and last time a user without MFA was detected, the values and count of the API calls made, the type of user identity, ARN and the name of the user.",

These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):<br></br><ul><li><b>Label:</b> AWS Event Name, <b>Field:</b> eventName</li><li><b>Label:</b> AWS User ARN, <b>Field:</b> userIdentity.arn</li><li><b>Label:</b> AWS User Type, <b>Field:</b> userIdentity.type</li></ul><br></br>Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`",

Please ignore the service accounts, if triggered and instead add them to the aws_service_accounts.csv file to fine tune the detection.
