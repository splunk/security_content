description: This search detects remote code exploit attempts on F5 BIG-IP, BIG-IQ, and Traffix SDC devices
how_to_implement: 'To consistently detect exploit attempts on F5 devices using the vulnerabilities
contained within CVE-2020-5902 it is recommended to ingest logs via syslog.  As many BIG-IP devices will
have SSL enabled on their management interfaces, detections via wire data may not pick anything up unless
you are decrypting SSL traffic in order to inspect it.  I am using a regex string from a Cloudflare
mitigation technique to try and always catch the offending string (..;), along with the other exploit of using
(hsqldb;).'
