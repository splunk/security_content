description: This search allows you to identify DNS requests and compute the standard
  deviation on the length of the names being resolved, then filter on two times the
  standard deviation to show you those queries that are unusually large for your environment.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that
  DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
