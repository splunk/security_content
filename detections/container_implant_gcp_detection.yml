eli5: In this search we can detect if a new container has been uploaded to Google Container Registry,
   operator can monitor users uploading containers, object paths of new uploaded containers.

how_to_implement: You must install the GCP App for Splunk (version 2.0.0 or later), then configure stackdriver and set a Pub/Sub subscription to be imported to Splunk. You must also install Cloud Infrastructure data model.Customize the macro container_implant_gcp_detection_filter to filter out FPs.

known_false_positives: Uploading container is a normal behavior from developers or users with access to container registry. GCP GCR registers container upload as a Storage event, this search must be considered under the context of CONTAINER upload creation which automatically generates a bucket entry for destination path.
