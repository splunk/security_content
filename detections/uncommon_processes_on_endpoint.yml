description: This search looks for applications on the endpoint that you have marked
  as uncommon.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model. This search uses a lookup file `uncommon_processes_default.csv` to track
  various features of process names that are usually uncommon in most environments.
  Please consider updating `uncommon_processes_local.csv` to hunt for processes that
  are uncommon in your environment.
