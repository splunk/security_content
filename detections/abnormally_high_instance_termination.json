Since we want to detect a high number of instances terminated within a short period, we create event buckets for 10-minute windows. We then calculate the total number of instances terminated by a particular user, as well as the average- and standard-deviation values. Assign a <code>threshold_value</code> in the search. Try starting with 3 (but it will likely need to be tweaked for your environment). The <code>eval</code> function will set the outlier to 1 if the number of instances is greater than the average number of instances terminated, added to the multiplied value of threshold and standard deviation. We then filter out outliers with a value of 1 and show only those instance-termination events that happened within the previous 10 minutes.",
