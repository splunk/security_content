description: This search looks for suspicious processes on all systems labeled as
  web servers.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model. In addition, web servers will need to be identified in the Assets and Identity
  Framework of Enterprise Security.
