description: This search looks for child processes of spoolsv.exe. This activity is
  associated with a POC privilege-escalation exploit associated with CVE-2018-8440.
  Spoolsv.exe is the process associated with the Print Spooler service in Windows
  and typically runs as SYSTEM.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model. Update the `children_of_spoolsv_filter` macro
  to filter out legitimate child processes spawned by spoolsv.exe.
