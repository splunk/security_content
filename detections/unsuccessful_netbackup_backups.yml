description: This search gives you the hosts where a backup was attempted and then
  failed.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to obtain data from
  your backup solution, either from the backup logs on your endpoints or from a central
  server responsible for performing the backups. If you do not use Netbackup, you
  can modify this search for your specific backup solution.
