description: This search detects new API calls that have either never been seen before
  or that have not been seen in the previous hour, where the identity type is `AssumedRole`.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously seen API call per user
  roles in CloudTrail" support search once to create a history of previously seen
  user roles.

known_false_positives: It is possible that there are legitimate user roles making
  new or infrequently used API calls in your infrastructure, causing the search to
  trigger.
