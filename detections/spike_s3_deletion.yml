eli5: 'This search and its corresponding subsearch run through the following series
  of steps: \

  1. Retrieve all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls
  specifically for deletion of S3 buckets.\

  1. Kick off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out and converts
  the ARN into a more friendly format.\

  1. Count the number of API calls per ARN.\

  1. Load the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the
  latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\

  1. Drop the count from the latest hour, since it is unnecessary, and merge the rest
  of the data with the results of the `stats` command. \

  1. Rename `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\

  1. Calculate the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting
  the past more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation&#151;weighting
  the past more heavily than the current.\

  1. Update the cache file with the latest results.\

  1. Set the minimum threshold for the number of data points and the number of standard
  deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\

  1. Make a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by
  checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and if the count
  is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\

  1. Filter out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of
  ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of the deleted
  S3 buckets, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for
  each of these src_user ARNs.'

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit
  your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data
  points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine.
  The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from
  the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best
  when you run the "Baseline of S3 Bucket deletion activity by ARN" support search
  once to create a baseline of previously seen S3 bucket-deletion activity.
