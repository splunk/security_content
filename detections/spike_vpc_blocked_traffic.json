  "eli5": "This search retrieves all the VPC Flow log entries that have recorded a blocked outbound network connection originating from your AWS environment. Then it kicks off a subsearch, which looks at the same data and performs the following series of steps: \\n1. Counts the number of blocked outbound connections by each source IP\\n1. Loads the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the average blocked connections, and the standard deviation for each source IP.\\n1. Drops the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merges the rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \\n1. Renames `numberOfBlockedConnections` as `latestCount`.\\n1. Calculates the new average value for each source IP with the latest count, weighting the past much more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation, weighting the past more heavily than the current.\\n1. Updates the cache file with the latest results.\\n1. Sets the minimum threshold for the number of data points and sets the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\\n1. Makes a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\\n1. Filters out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of source IPs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the list of all destination IPs for which the traffic was blocked, the network interface ID, the number of unique destination IP, and the total number of blocked connections for each of these source IP addresses. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.",

  "how_to_implement": "You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your VPC Flow logs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the number of data points required to meet the definition of \"spike.\" The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best when you run the \"Baseline of Blocked Outbound Connection\" support search once to create a history of previously seen blocked outbound connections.",
