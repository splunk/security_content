description: This searches show information on uploaded containers including source
  user, image id, source IP user type, http user agent, region, first time, last time
  of operation (PutImage). These searches are based on Cloud Infrastructure Data Model.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. You must also install Cloud Infrastructure data model. Please also customize
  the `container_implant_aws_detection_filter` macro to filter out the false positives.
