eli5: The files system, security, sam and ntds.dit containing sensitive credentials. Normally, the files can't be easily copied.
  But it is possible by creating first a shadowcopy and then create a symlink to the shadowcopy. This search will detect this attack of
  credential dumping.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
