You must also populate the <code>identity_lookup_expanded</code> lookup shipped with the Asset and Identity framework to be able to look up users in your identity table in Enterprise Security (ES). Leverage the support search called \"Create a list of approved AWS service accounts\": run it once every 30 days to create and validate a list of service accounts.",

These fields contribute additional context to the notable.
