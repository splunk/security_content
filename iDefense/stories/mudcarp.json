    "narrative": "This story was created as a joint effort between iDefense and Splunk.<br></br>iDefense analysts have recently discovered a Windows executable file that, upon execution, spoofs a decryption tool and then drops a file that appears to be the custom-built javascript backdoor, \"Orz,\" which is associated with the threat actors known as MUDCARP (as well as \"temp.Periscope\" and \"Leviathan\"). The file is executed using Wscript.<br></br>The MUDCARP techniques include the use of the compressed-folders module from Microsoft, zipfldr.dll, with RouteTheCall export to run the malicious process or command. After a successful reboot, the malware is made persistent by a manipulating <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run]'help'='c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\rundll32.exe c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall c:\\\\programdata\\\\winapp.exe'</code>. Though this technique is not exclusive to MUDCARP, it has been spotted in the group's arsenal of advanced techniques seen in the wild.<br></br>This Analytic Story searches for evidence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that allow for the use of a endpoint detection-and-response (EDR) bypass technique to mask the true parent of a malicious process. It can also be set as a registry key for further sandbox evasion and to allow the malware to launch only after reboot.<br></br>If behavioral searches included in this story yield positive hits, iDefense recommends conducting IOC searches for the following:<br></br><ul><li>www.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>chemscalere[.]com</li><li>about.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>autoconfig.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>autodiscover.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>catalog.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>cpanel.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>db.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>ftp.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>mail.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>news.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>update.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>webmail.chemscalere[.]com</li><li>www.candlelightparty[.]org</li><li>candlelightparty[.]org</li><li>newapp.freshasianews[.]com</li></ul>In addition, iDefense also recommends that organizations review their environments for activity related to the following hashes:<br></br><ul><li>cd195ee448a3657b5c2c2d13e9c7a2e2</li><li>b43ad826fe6928245d3c02b648296b43</li><li>889a9b52566448231f112a5ce9b5dfaf</li><li>b8ec65dab97cdef3cd256cc4753f0c54</li><li>04d83cd3813698de28cfbba326d7647c</li></ul>",
