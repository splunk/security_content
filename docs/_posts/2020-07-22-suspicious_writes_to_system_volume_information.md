#### Search 

```
(`sysmon` OR tag=process) EventCode=11 process_id!=4 file_path=*System\ Volume\ Information* 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, Image, file_path 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `suspicious_writes_to_system_volume_information_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **suspicious_writes_to_system_volume_information_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time


#### How To Implement
You need to be ingesting logs with both the process name and command-line from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.

#### Known False Positives
It is possible that other utilities or system processes may legitimately write to this folder. Investigate and modify the search to include exceptions as appropriate.

> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
