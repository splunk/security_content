```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [previously_seen_cloud_api_calls_per_user_role](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cloud_api_calls_per_user_role.yml) with [data]()

#### Required field
* _time
* All_Changes.user
* All_Changes.user_type
* All_Changes.status
* All_Changes.command
* All_Changes.object


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud provider.  You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud API Calls Per User Role - Initial` to build the initial table of user roles, commands, and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud API Calls Per User Role - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can adjust the time window for this search by updating the `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_activity_window` macro. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_filter`

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 36.0 | 60 | 60 | User $user$ of type AssumedRole attempting to execute new API calls $command$ that have not been seen before |
