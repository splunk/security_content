| ID             | Technique        |  Tactic             |
| -------------- | ---------------- |-------------------- |
| [T1210](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210/) | Exploitation of Remote Services | Lateral Movement |

#### Search

```
`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4742 TargetUserName="ANONYMOUS LOGON" LogonType=3 
| stats count values(host) as host, values(TargetDomainName) as Domain, values(user) as user 
| `detect_computer_changed_with_anonymous_account_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

Note that `detect_computer_changed_with_anonymous_account_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* EventCode
* TargetUserName
* LogonType
* TargetDomainName
* user


#### How To Implement
This search requires audit computer account management to be enabled on the system in order to generate Event ID 4742. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Event Logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.

#### Known False Positives
None thus far found
