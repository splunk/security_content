###  WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL object
We have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this object. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

This search looks for commands that the SNICat tool uses in the TLS SNI field.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [zeek_ssl](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/zeek_ssl.yml)

Note that `detect_snicat_sni_exfiltration_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* server_name
* src_ip
* dest_ip


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting Zeek SSL data into Splunk. Zeek data should also be getting ingested in JSON format.  We are detecting when any of the predefined SNICat commands are found within the server_name (SNI) field. These commands are LIST, LS, SIZE, LD, CB, EX, ALIVE, EXIT, WHERE, and finito.  You can go further once this has been detected, and run other searches to decode the SNI data to prove or disprove if any data exfiltration has taken place.

#### Known False Positives
Unknown

#### Associated Analytic story

#### Kill Chain Phase

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |

| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | tbd |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
