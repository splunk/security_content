#### Description

This search returns a list of hosts that have not successfully completed a backup in over a week. Deprecated because it's a infrastructure monitoring.

- **Type**: [Hunting](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: 
- **Last Updated**: 2017-09-12

#### Search

```
`netbackup` MESSAGE="Disk/Partition backup completed successfully." 
| stats latest(_time) as latestTime by COMPUTERNAME 
| `security_content_ctime(latestTime)` 
| rename COMPUTERNAME as dest 
| eval isOutlier=if(latestTime <= relative_time(now(), "-7d@d"), 1, 0) 
| search isOutlier=1 
| table latestTime, dest 
| `extended_period_without_successful_netbackup_backups_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [netbackup](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/netbackup.yml)

Note that `extended_period_without_successful_netbackup_backups_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* MESSAGE
* COMPUTERNAME


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to first obtain data from your backup solution, either from the backup logs on your hosts, or from a central server responsible for performing the backups. If you do not use Netbackup, you can modify this search for your backup solution. Depending on how often you backup your systems, you may want to modify how far in the past to look for a successful backup, other than the default of seven days.

#### Known False Positives
