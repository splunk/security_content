#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)
* [ec2_modification_api_calls](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/ec2_modification_api_calls.yml)

> :information_source:
> **ec2_instance_modified_with_previously_unseen_user_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [previously_seen_ec2_modifications_by_user](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_ec2_modifications_by_user.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/previously_seen_ec2_modifications_by_user.csv)
* [previously_seen_ec2_modifications_by_user](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_ec2_modifications_by_user.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/previously_seen_ec2_modifications_by_user.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* errorCode
* userIdentity.arn


#### How To Implement
You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen EC2 Launches By User" support search once to create a history of previously seen ARNs. To add or remove APIs that modify an EC2 instance, edit the macro `ec2_modification_api_calls`.

#### Known False Positives
It's possible that a new user will start to modify EC2 instances when they haven't before for any number of reasons. Verify with the user that is modifying instances that this is the intended behavior.
