#### Description

This search looks for command-line arguments that use a `/c` parameter to execute a command that has not previously been seen.

- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Endpoint](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Endpoint)

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `first_time_seen_command_line_argument_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.csv)
* [previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.dest


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must be ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints. The complete process name with command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data model. Please make sure you run the support search "Previously seen command line arguments,"&#151;which creates a lookup file called `previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.csv`&#151;a historical baseline of all command-line arguments. You must also validate this list. For the search to do accurate calculation, ensure the search scheduling is the same value as the `relative_time` evaluation function.

#### Known False Positives
Legitimate programs can also use command-line arguments to execute. Please verify the command-line arguments to check what command/program is being executed. We recommend customizing the `first_time_seen_cmd_line_filter` macro to exclude legitimate parent_process_name
