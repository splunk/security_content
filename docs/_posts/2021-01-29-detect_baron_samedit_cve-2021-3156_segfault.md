#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Baron Samedit CVE-2021-3156](/stories/baron_samedit_cve-2021-3156)


#### How To Implement
Splunk Universal Forwarder running on Linux systems (tested on Centos and Ubuntu), where segfaults are being logged.  This also captures instances where the exploit has been compiled into a binary. The detection looks for greater than 5 instances of sudoedit combined with segfault over your search time period on a single host

#### Required field
* _time
* host


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
If sudoedit is throwing segfaults for other reasons this will pick those up too.
