#### Description

The following analtyic identifies renamed instances of `WinRAR.exe`. In most cases, it is not common for WinRAR to be used renamed, however it is common to be installed by a third party application and executed from a non-standard path. In this instance, we are using `OriginalFileName` from Sysmon to determine if the process is WinRAR. During triage, validate additional metadata from the binary that this is `WinRAR`. Review parallel processes and file modifications.

#### Search

```

| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, User, parent_process_name, process_name, OriginalFileName, process_path, CommandLine Product

#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Modify query for specific EDR products as needed.

#### Required field
* _time
* dest
* User
* parent_process_name
* process_name
* OriginalFileName
* process_path
* CommandLine
* Product


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation
* Exfiltration


#### Known False Positives
Unknown. It is possible third party applications use renamed instances of WinRAR.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 27.0 | 30 | 90 | The following $process_name$ has been identified as renamed, spawning from $parent_process_name$ on $dest$ by $user$. |
