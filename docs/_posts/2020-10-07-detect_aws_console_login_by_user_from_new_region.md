#### Description

This search looks for AWS CloudTrail events wherein a console login event by a user was recorded within the last hour, then compares the event to a lookup file of previously seen users (by ARN values) who have logged into the console. The alert is fired if the user has logged into the console for the first time within the last hour

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Suspicious AWS Login Activities](/stories/suspicious_aws_login_activities)
* [Suspicious Cloud Authentication Activities](/stories/suspicious_cloud_authentication_activities)


#### How To Implement
You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 5.1.0 or later) and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Run the `Previously Seen Users in AWS CloudTrail - Initial` support search only once to create a baseline of previously seen IAM users within the last 30 days. Run `Previously Seen Users in AWS CloudTrail - Update` hourly (or more frequently depending on how often you run the detection searches) to refresh the baselines. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `detect_aws_console_login_by_user_from_new_region_filter` macro.

#### Required field
* _time
* Authentication.signature
* Authentication.user
* Authentication.src


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Actions on Objectives


#### Known False Positives
When a legitimate new user logins for the first time, this activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the user activity is legitimate.


#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 36.0 | 60 | 60 | User $user$ is logging into the AWS console from Region $Region$ for the first time |
