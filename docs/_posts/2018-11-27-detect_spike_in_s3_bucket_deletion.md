### ⚠️ WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
We have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.


[Try in Splunk Security Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/cyber-security.html){: .btn .btn--success}

#### Description

This search detects users creating spikes in API activity related to deletion of S3 buckets in your AWS environment. It will also update the cache file that factors in the latest data.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)

Note that `detect_spike_in_s3_bucket_deletion_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [s3_deletion_baseline](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/s3_deletion_baseline.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/s3_deletion_baseline.csv)
* [s3_deletion_baseline](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/s3_deletion_baseline.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/s3_deletion_baseline.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* eventName
* userIdentity.arn


#### How To Implement
You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine. The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best when you run the &#34;Baseline of S3 Bucket deletion activity by ARN&#34; support search once to create a baseline of previously seen S3 bucket-deletion activity.

#### Known False Positives
Based on the values of`dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold`, the false positive rate may vary. Please modify this according the your environment.
