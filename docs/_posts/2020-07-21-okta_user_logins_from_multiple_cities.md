#### Description

This search detects logins from the same user from different cities in a 24 hour period.

#### Search

```
`okta` displayMessage="User login to Okta" client.geographicalContext.city!=null 
| stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime dc(client.geographicalContext.city) as locations values(client.geographicalContext.city) as cities values(client.geographicalContext.state) as states by user

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `okta_user_logins_from_multiple_cities_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* displayMessage
* client.geographicalContext.city
* client.geographicalContext.state
* user


#### How To Implement
This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being ingested in your Splunk deployment.

#### Known False Positives
Users in your enviornment may legitmately be travelling and loggin in from different locations. This search is useful for those users that should *not* be travelling for some reason, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The search also relies on the geographical information being populated in the Okta logs. It is also possible that a connection from another region may be attributed to a login from a remote VPN endpoint.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | tbd |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
