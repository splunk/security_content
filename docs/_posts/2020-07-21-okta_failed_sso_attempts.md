### ⚠️ WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
We have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

Detect failed Okta SSO events

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: 
- **Last Updated**: 2020-07-21

| ID             | Technique        |  Tactic             |
| -------------- | ---------------- |-------------------- |
| [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/) | Valid Accounts | Defense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access |

#### Search

```
`okta` displayMessage="User attempted unauthorized access to app" 
| stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(app) as Apps count by user, result ,displayMessage, src_ip 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `okta_failed_sso_attempts_filter` 
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `okta_failed_sso_attempts_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* displayMessage
* app
* user
* result
* src_ip


#### How To Implement
This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being ingested in your Splunk deployment.

#### Known False Positives
There may be a faulty config preventing legitmate users from accessing apps they should have access to.

#### Associated Analytic story
* [Suspicious Okta Activity](/stories/suspicious_okta_activity)


#### Kill Chain Phase




Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`



#### Reference


#### Test Dataset
Replay any dataset to Splunk Enterprise by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui).
Alternatively you can replay a dataset into a [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#replay-dumps-into-attack-range-splunk-server)
