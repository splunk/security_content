#### Description

This analytic identifies a process making a DNS query to Discord, a well known instant messaging and digital distribution platform. Discord can be abused by adversaries, as seen in the WhisperGate campaign, to host and download malicious. external files. A process resolving a Discord DNS name could be an indicator of malware trying to download files from Discord for further execution.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*discord*") process_path != "*\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\*" AND process_path != "*\\Program Files*" AND process_name != "discord.exe" 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName QueryStatus process_name QueryResults Computer process_path

| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `suspicious_process_with_discord_dns_query_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

Note that `suspicious_process_with_discord_dns_query_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* Image
* QueryName
* QueryStatus
* process_name
* QueryResults
* Computer
* process_path


#### How To Implement
his detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 22, DNS Query.

#### Known False Positives
Noise and false positive can be seen if the following instant messaging is allowed to use within corporate network. In this case, a filter is needed.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | suspicious process $process_name$ has a dns query in $QueryName$ on $Computer$ |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
