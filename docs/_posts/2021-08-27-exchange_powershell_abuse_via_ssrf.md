### :warning: WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL analytic
We have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this object. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.


[Try in Splunk Security Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/cyber-security.html){: .btn .btn--success}

#### Description

This analytic identifies suspicious behavior related to ProxyShell against on-premise Microsoft Exchange servers. \
Modification of this analytic is requried to ensure fields are mapped accordingly. \
A suspicious event will have `PowerShell`, the method `POST` and `autodiscover.json`. This is indicative of accessing PowerShell on the back end of Exchange with SSRF. \
An event will look similar to `POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.json a=dsxvu@fnsso.flq/powershell/?X-Rps-CAT=VgEAVAdXaW5kb3d...` (abbreviated) \
Review the source attempting to perform this activity against your environment. In addition, review PowerShell logs and access recently granted to Exchange roles.

#### Search 

```

| `exchange` c_uri="*//autodiscover.json*" cs_uri_query="*PowerShell*" cs_method="POST" 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, cs_uri_query, cs_method, c_uri 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `exchange_powershell_abuse_via_ssrf_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [exchange](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/exchange.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **exchange_powershell_abuse_via_ssrf_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* dest
* cs_uri_query
* cs_method
* c_uri


#### How To Implement
The following analytic requires on-premise Exchange to be logging to Splunk using the TA - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3225. Ensure logs are parsed correctly, or tune the analytic for your environment.

#### Known False Positives
Limited false positives, however, tune as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 80.0 | 80 | 100 | Activity related to ProxyShell has been identified on $dest$. Review events and take action accordingly. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
