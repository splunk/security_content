#### Description

The search looks for modifications to the hosts file on all Windows endpoints across your environment.

- **Type**: [TTP](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: 
- **Last Updated**: 2018-11-02
- **Author**: Rico Valdez, Splunk
- **ID**: 06a6fc63-a72d-41dc-8736-7e3dd9612116

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem  by Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.file_path Filesystem.dest 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| search Filesystem.file_name=hosts AND Filesystem.file_path=*Windows\\System32\\* 
| `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` 
| `windows_hosts_file_modification_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `windows_hosts_file_modification_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records the file-system activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint.Filesystem data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black, or by other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report file-system reads and writes.

#### Known False Positives
There may be legitimate reasons for system administrators to add entries to this file.
