### ⚠️ WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
We have not been able to test, simulate or build datasets for it, use at your own risk!

#### Description

This search looks for suspicious Java classes that are often used to exploit remote command execution in common Java frameworks, such as Apache Struts.

- **Type**: Anomaly
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: 
- **Last Updated**: 2018-12-06
- **Author**: Jose Hernandez, Splunk
- **ID**: if1fea6da-3c86-4c1d-b255-fc3b2781a491



#### Search

```
`stream_http` http_method=POST http_content_length>1 
| regex form_data="(?i)java\.lang\.(?:runtime
|processbuilder)" 
| rename src_ip as src 
| stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime, latest(_time) as lastTime, values(url) as uri, values(status) as status, values(http_user_agent) as http_user_agent by src, dest

```

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Apache Struts Vulnerability](/stories/apache_struts_vulnerability)


#### How To Implement
In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data from your web-traffic appliances that serve or sit in the path of your Struts application servers. This can be accomplished by indexing data from a web proxy, or by using network traffic-analysis tools, such as Splunk Stream or Bro.

#### Required field
* _time
* http_method
* http_content_length
* src_ip
* url
* status
* http_user_agent
* src
* dest


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
There are no known false positives.




#### Reference


#### Test Dataset
Replay any dataset to Splunk Enterprise by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui).
Alternatively you can replay a dataset into a [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#replay-dumps-into-attack-range-splunk-server)
