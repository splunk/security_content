#### Description

The following analytic identifies Windows Service Control, `sc.exe`, attempting to delete a service. This is typically identified in parallel with other instances of service enumeration of attempts to stop a service and then delete it. Adversaries utilize this technique to terminate security services or other related services to continue there objective and evade detections.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

Note that `attempt_to_delete_services_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* dest_device_id
* process_name
* parent_process_name
* process_path
* dest_user_id
* process
* cmd_line


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.

#### Known False Positives
It is possible administrative scripts may start/stop/delete services. Filter as needed.
