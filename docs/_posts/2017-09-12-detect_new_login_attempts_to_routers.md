### ⚠️ WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
We have not been able to test, simulate or build datasets for it, use at your own risk!

#### Description

The search queries the authentication logs for assets that are categorized as routers in the ES Assets and Identity Framework, to identify connections that have not been seen before in the last 30 days.

- **Type**: TTP
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Authentication](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Authentication)
- **Last Updated**: 2017-09-12

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count earliest(_time) as earliest latest(_time) as latest from datamodel=Authentication where Authentication.dest_category=router by Authentication.dest Authentication.user
| eval isOutlier=if(earliest >= relative_time(now(), "-30d@d"), 1, 0) 
| where isOutlier=1
| `security_content_ctime(earliest)`
| `security_content_ctime(latest)` 
| `drop_dm_object_name("Authentication")` 
| `detect_new_login_attempts_to_routers_filter`
```

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Router and Infrastructure Security](/stories/router_and_infrastructure_security)


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must ensure the network router devices are categorized as &#34;router&#34; in the Assets and identity table. You must also populate the Authentication data model with logs related to users authenticating to routing infrastructure.

#### Required field
* _time
* Authentication.dest_category
* Authentication.dest
* Authentication.user


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Actions on Objectives


#### Known False Positives
Legitimate router connections may appear as new connections
