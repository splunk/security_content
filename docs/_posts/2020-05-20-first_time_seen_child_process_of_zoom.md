###  WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL object
We have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this object. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

This search looks for child processes spawned by zoom.exe or zoom.us that has not previously been seen.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Endpoint](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Endpoint)
- **Last Updated**: 2020-05-20
- **Author**: David Dorsey, Splunk
- **ID**: e91bd102-d630-4e76-ab73-7e3ba22c5961

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [previously_seen_zoom_child_processes_window](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/previously_seen_zoom_child_processes_window.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `first_time_seen_child_process_of_zoom_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [zoom_first_time_child_process](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/zoom_first_time_child_process.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/zoom_first_time_child_process.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process_id
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.dest


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Zoom Child Processes - Initial` to build the initial table of child processes and hostnames for this search to work. You should also schedule at the same interval as this search the second baseline search `Previously Seen Zoom Child Processes - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old child processes. Please update the `previously_seen_zoom_child_processes_window` macro to adjust the time window.

#### Known False Positives
A new child process of zoom isn't malicious by that fact alone. Further investigation of the actions of the child process is needed to verify any malicious behavior is taken.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | Child process $process_name$ with $process_id$ spawned by zoom.exe or zoom.us which has not been previously on host $dest$ |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
