### ⚠️ WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
We have not been able to test, simulate or build datasets for it, use at your own risk!

#### Description

By enabling Dynamic ARP Inspection as a Layer 2 Security measure on the organization&#39;s network devices, we will be able to detect ARP Poisoning attacks in the Infrastructure.

- **Type**: TTP
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: 
- **Last Updated**: 2020-08-11

#### ATT&CK

| ID          | Technique   | Tactic       |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|
| [T1200](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1200/) | Hardware Additions | Initial Access |
| [T1498](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/) | Network Denial of Service | Impact |
| [T1557.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002/) | ARP Cache Poisoning | Credential Access, Collection |


#### Search

#### Associated Analytic Story

#### How To Implement
This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network devices. The network devices must be configured with DHCP Snooping (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-0_2_EX/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg_chapter_01101.html) and Dynamic ARP Inspection (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-2_2_e/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg_chapter_01111.html) and log with a severity level of minimum &#34;5 - notification&#34;. The search also requires that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467) is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.

#### Required field
* _time
* facility
* mnemonic
* disable_cause
* src_int_prefix_long
* src_int_suffix
* host
* src_interface


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Reconnaissance
* Delivery
* Actions on Objectives


#### Known False Positives
This search might be prone to high false positives if DHCP Snooping or ARP inspection has been incorrectly configured, or if a device normally sends many ARP packets (unlikely).




#### Reference


#### Test Dataset
Replay any dataset to Splunk Enterprise by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui).
Alternatively you can replay a dataset into a [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#replay-dumps-into-attack-range-splunk-server)
