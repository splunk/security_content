### ⚠️ WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
We have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

By enabling Dynamic ARP Inspection as a Layer 2 Security measure on the organization&#39;s network devices, we will be able to detect ARP Poisoning attacks in the Infrastructure.

- **Type**: [TTP](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)

#### Search

```
`cisco_networks` facility="PM" mnemonic="ERR_DISABLE" disable_cause="arp-inspection" 
| eval src_interface=src_int_prefix_long+src_int_suffix 
| stats min(_time) AS firstTime max(_time) AS lastTime count BY host src_interface 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
| `detect_arp_poisoning_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cisco_networks](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cisco_networks.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `detect_arp_poisoning_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* facility
* mnemonic
* disable_cause
* src_int_prefix_long
* src_int_suffix
* host
* src_interface


#### How To Implement
This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network devices. The network devices must be configured with DHCP Snooping (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-0_2_EX/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg_chapter_01101.html) and Dynamic ARP Inspection (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-2_2_e/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg_chapter_01111.html) and log with a severity level of minimum &#34;5 - notification&#34;. The search also requires that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467) is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.

#### Known False Positives
This search might be prone to high false positives if DHCP Snooping or ARP inspection has been incorrectly configured, or if a device normally sends many ARP packets (unlikely).
