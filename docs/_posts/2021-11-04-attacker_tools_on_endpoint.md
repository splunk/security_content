#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `attacker_tools_on_endpoint_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [attacker_tools](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/attacker_tools.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/attacker_tools.csv)

#### Required field
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.parent_process


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model in the processes node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is usually generated via logs that report process tracking in your Windows audit settings.

#### Known False Positives
Some administrator activity can be potentially triggered, please add those users to the filter macro.

* [Unusual Processes](/stories/unusual_processes)


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Installation
* Command and Control
* Actions on Objectives
