#### Description

This detection is to identify a suspicious process that tries to delete the process file path related to its process. This technique is known to be defense evasion once a certain condition of malware is satisfied or not. Clop ransomware use this technique where it will try to delete its process file path using a .bat command if the keyboard layout is not the layout it tries to infect.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=1 CommandLine = "* /c *" CommandLine = "* del*" Image = "*\\cmd.exe" 
| eval result = if(like(process,"%".parent_process."%"), "Found", "Not Found") 
| stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by Computer user ParentImage ParentCommandLine Image CommandLine EventCode ProcessID result

| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `process_deleting_its_process_file_path_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

Note that `process_deleting_its_process_file_path_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* EventCode
* Computer
* user
* ParentImage
* ParentCommandLine
* Image
* cmdline
* ProcessID
* result
* _time


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints. The command-line arguments are mapped to the &#34;process&#34; field in the Endpoint data model.

#### Known False Positives

#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation



#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 60.0 | 60 | 100 | A process $Image$ tries to delete its process path in commandline $cmdline$ as part of defense evasion in host $Computer$ |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
