#### [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)

| ID             | Technique        |  Tactic             |
| -------------- | ---------------- |-------------------- |
| [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) | Exploit Public-Facing Application | Initial Access |

#### Search

```
`f5_bigip_rogue` 
| regex _raw="(hsqldb;
|.*\\.\\.;.*)" 
| search `detect_f5_tmui_rce_cve_2020_5902_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [f5_bigip_rogue](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/f5_bigip_rogue.yml)

Note that `detect_f5_tmui_rce_cve-2020-5902_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time


#### How To Implement
To consistently detect exploit attempts on F5 devices using the vulnerabilities contained within CVE-2020-5902 it is recommended to ingest logs via syslog.  As many BIG-IP devices will have SSL enabled on their management interfaces, detections via wire data may not pick anything up unless you are decrypting SSL traffic in order to inspect it.  I am using a regex string from a Cloudflare mitigation technique to try and always catch the offending string (..;), along with the other exploit of using (hsqldb;).
