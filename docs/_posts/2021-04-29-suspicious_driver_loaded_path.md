#### Description

This analytic will detect suspicious driver loaded paths. This technique is commonly used by malicious software like coin miners (xmrig) to register its malicious driver from notable directories where executable or drivers do not commonly exist. During triage, validate this driver is for legitimate business use. Review the metadata and certificate information. Unsigned drivers from non-standard paths is not normal, but occurs. In addition, review driver loads into `ntoskrnl.exe` for possible other drivers of interest. Long tail analyze drivers by path (outside of default, and in default) for further review.

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [XMRig](/stories/xmrig)


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the driver loaded and Signature from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.

#### Required field
* _time
* Computer
* ImageLoaded
* Hashes
* IMPHASH
* Signature
* Signed


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
Limited false positives will be present. Some applications do load drivers
