#### Description

This analytic will identify suspicious system event of services that was modified from start to disabled. This technique is seen where the adversary attempts to disable security app services, other malware services to evade the defense systems on the compromised host

#### Search 

```
`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7040  Message = "*service was changed from demand start to disabled." 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName EventCode Message User Sid service service_name 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_event_for_service_disabled_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_system](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_system.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_event_for_service_disabled_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* ComputerName
* EventCode
* Message
* User
* Sid


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type from your endpoints.

#### Known False Positives
Windows service update may cause this event. In that scenario, filtering is needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 36.0 | 60 | 60 | Service was disabled on $Computer$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
