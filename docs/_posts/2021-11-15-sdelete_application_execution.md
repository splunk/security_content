#### Description

This analytic will detect the execution of sdelete.exe attempting to delete potentially important files that may related to adversary or insider threats to destroy evidence or information sabotage. Sdelete is a SysInternals utility meant to securely delete files on disk. This tool is commonly used to clear tracks and artifact on the targeted host.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

Note that `sdelete_application_execution_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* dest
* user
* parent_process_name
* parent_process
* process_name
* process
* process_id
* process_path
* cmd_line


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.

#### Known False Positives
False positives should be limited, filter as needed.
