#### Description

This search detects new API calls that have either never been seen before or that have not been seen in the previous hour, where the identity type is `AssumedRole`.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `detect_new_api_calls_from_user_roles_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [previously_seen_api_calls_from_user_roles](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_api_calls_from_user_roles.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/previously_seen_api_calls_from_user_roles.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* eventType
* errorCode
* userIdentity.type
* userName
* eventName


#### How To Implement
You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously seen API call per user roles in AWS CloudTrail" support search once to create a history of previously seen user roles.

#### Known False Positives
It is possible that there are legitimate user roles making new or infrequently used API calls in your infrastructure, causing the search to trigger.
