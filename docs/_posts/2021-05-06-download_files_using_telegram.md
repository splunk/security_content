#### Description

The following analytic will identify a suspicious download by the Telegram application on a Windows system. This behavior was identified on a honeypot where the adversary gained access, installed Telegram and followed through with downloading different network scanners (port, bruteforcer, masscan) to the system and later used to mapped the whole network and further move laterally.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode= 15 process_name = "telegram.exe" TargetFilename = "*:Zone.Identifier" 
|stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode Image process_id TargetFilename Hash 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `download_files_using_telegram_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

Note that `download_files_using_telegram_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* Computer
* EventCode
* Image
* process_id
* TargetFilename
* Hash


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name and TargetFilename from your endpoints or Events that monitor filestream events which is happened when process download something. (EventCode 15) If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.

#### Known False Positives
normal download of file in telegram app. (if it was a common app in network)
