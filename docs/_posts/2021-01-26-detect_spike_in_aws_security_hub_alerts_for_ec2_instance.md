#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [aws_securityhub_finding](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/aws_securityhub_finding.yml)

Note that `detect_spike_in_aws_security_hub_alerts_for_ec2_instance_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* Resources{}.Type
* Title
* Types{}
* vendor_account
* vendor_region
* severity
* dest


#### How To Implement
You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your Security Hub inputs. The threshold_value should be tuned to your environment and schedule these searches according to the bucket span interval.

#### Known False Positives

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 15.0 | 30 | 50 | Spike in AWS security Hub alerts with title $Title$ for EC2 instance $dest$ |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
