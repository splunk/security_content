#### Description

This search gives you the hosts where a backup was attempted and then failed.

- **Type**: [Hunting](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: 
- **Last Updated**: 2017-09-12
- **Author**: David Dorsey, Splunk
- **ID**: a34aae96-ccf8-4aaa-952c-3ea21444444f

#### Search

```
`netbackup` 
| stats latest(_time) as latestTime by COMPUTERNAME, MESSAGE 
| search MESSAGE="An error occurred, failed to backup." 
| `security_content_ctime(latestTime)` 
| rename COMPUTERNAME as dest, MESSAGE as signature 
| table latestTime, dest, signature 
| `unsuccessful_netbackup_backups_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [netbackup](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/netbackup.yml)

Note that `unsuccessful_netbackup_backups_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to obtain data from your backup solution, either from the backup logs on your endpoints or from a central server responsible for performing the backups. If you do not use Netbackup, you can modify this search for your specific backup solution.

#### Known False Positives
None identified
