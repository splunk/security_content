#### Search 

```
`netbackup` 
| stats latest(_time) as latestTime by COMPUTERNAME, MESSAGE 
| search MESSAGE="An error occurred, failed to backup." 
| `security_content_ctime(latestTime)` 
| rename COMPUTERNAME as dest, MESSAGE as signature 
| table latestTime, dest, signature 
| `unsuccessful_netbackup_backups_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [netbackup](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/netbackup.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **unsuccessful_netbackup_backups_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to obtain data from your backup solution, either from the backup logs on your endpoints or from a central server responsible for performing the backups. If you do not use Netbackup, you can modify this search for your specific backup solution.

#### Known False Positives
None identified

#### Associated Analytic story

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | tbd |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
