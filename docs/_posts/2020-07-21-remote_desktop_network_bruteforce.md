### ⚠️ WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
We have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.


[Try in Splunk Security Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/cyber-security.html){: .btn .btn--success}

#### Description

This search looks for RDP application network traffic and filters any source/destination pair generating more than twice the standard deviation of the average traffic.

- **Type**: [TTP](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Network_Traffic](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/NetworkTraffic)
- **Last Updated**: 2020-07-21
- **Author**: Jose Hernandez, Splunk
- **ID**: a98727cc-286b-4ff2-b898-41df64695923

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.app=rdp by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest All_Traffic.dest_port 
| eventstats stdev(count) AS stdev avg(count) AS avg p50(count) AS p50

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `remote_desktop_network_bruteforce_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* All_Traffic.app
* All_Traffic.src
* All_Traffic.dest
* All_Traffic.dest_port


#### How To Implement
You must ensure that your network traffic data is populating the Network_Traffic data model.

#### Known False Positives
RDP gateways may have unusually high amounts of traffic from all other hosts&#39; RDP applications in the network.

#### Associated Analytic story
* [SamSam Ransomware](/stories/samsam_ransomware)
* [Ryuk Ransomware](/stories/ryuk_ransomware)


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Reconnaissance
* Delivery




Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`



#### Reference


#### Test Dataset
Replay any dataset to Splunk Enterprise by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui).
Alternatively you can replay a dataset into a [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#replay-dumps-into-attack-range-splunk-server)
