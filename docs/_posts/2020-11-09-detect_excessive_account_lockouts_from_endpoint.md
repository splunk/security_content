#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Account Monitoring and Controls](/stories/account_monitoring_and_controls)


#### How To Implement
You must ingest your Windows security event logs in the `Change` datamodel under the nodename is `Account_Management`, for this search to execute successfully. Please consider updating the cron schedule and the count of lockouts you want to monitor, according to your environment. \
 **Splunk&gt;Phantom Playbook Integration**\
If Splunk&gt;Phantom is also configured in your environment, a Playbook called &#34;Excessive Account Lockouts Enrichment and Response&#34; can be configured to run when any results are found by this detection search. The Playbook executes the Contextual and Investigative searches in this Story, conducts additional information gathering on Windows endpoints, and takes a response action to shut down the affected endpoint. To use this integration, install the Phantom App for Splunk `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/`, add the correct hostname to the &#34;Phantom Instance&#34; field in the Adaptive Response Actions when configuring this detection search, and set the corresponding Playbook to active. \

#### Required field
* _time
* All_Changes.user
* nodename
* All_Changes.result
* All_Changes.dest


#### Kill Chain Phase


#### Known False Positives
It&#39;s possible that a widely used system, such as a kiosk, could cause a large number of account lockouts.



#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 36.0 | 60 | 60 | Multiple accounts have been locked out. Review $dest$ and results related to $user$. |
