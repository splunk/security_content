#### Description

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `cloud_instance_modified_by_previously_unseen_user_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [previously_seen_cloud_instance_modifications_by_user](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cloud_instance_modifications_by_user.yml) with [data]()

#### Required field
* _time
* All_Changes.object_id
* All_Changes.command
* All_Changes.action
* All_Changes.change_type
* All_Changes.status
* All_Changes.user


#### How To Implement
This search has a dependency on other searches to create and update a baseline of users observed to be associated with this activity. The search &#34;Previously Seen Cloud Instance Modifications By User - Update&#34; should be enabled for this detection to properly work.

#### Known False Positives
It&#39;s possible that a new user will start to modify EC2 instances when they haven&#39;t before for any number of reasons. Verify with the user that is modifying instances that this is the intended behavior.

#### Kill Chain Phase



#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 42.0 | 70 | 60 | User $user$ is modifying an instance $dest$ for the first time. |
