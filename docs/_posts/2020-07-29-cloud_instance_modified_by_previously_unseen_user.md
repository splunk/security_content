#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Suspicious Cloud Instance Activities](/stories/suspicious_cloud_instance_activities)


#### How To Implement
This search has a dependency on other searches to create and update a baseline of users observed to be associated with this activity. The search &#34;Previously Seen Cloud Instance Modifications By User - Update&#34; should be enabled for this detection to properly work.

#### Required field
* _time
* All_Changes.object_id
* All_Changes.command
* All_Changes.action
* All_Changes.change_type
* All_Changes.status
* All_Changes.user


#### Kill Chain Phase


#### Known False Positives
It&#39;s possible that a new user will start to modify EC2 instances when they haven&#39;t before for any number of reasons. Verify with the user that is modifying instances that this is the intended behavior.



#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 42.0 | 70 | 60 | User $user$ is modifying an instance $dest$ for the first time. |
