#### Description

This search allows you to identify the endpoints that have connected to more than five DNS servers and made DNS Queries over the time frame of the search.

- **Type**: [TTP](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Network_Resolution](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/NetworkResolution)
- **Last Updated**: 2020-07-21
- **Author**: David Dorsey, Splunk
- **ID**: 74ec6f18-604b-4202-a567-86b2066be3ce

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count, values(DNS.dest) AS dest dc(DNS.dest) as dest_count from datamodel=Network_Resolution where DNS.message_type=QUERY by DNS.src 
| `drop_dm_object_name("Network_Resolution")` 
|where dest_count > 5 
| `clients_connecting_to_multiple_dns_servers_filter` 
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `clients_connecting_to_multiple_dns_servers_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* DNS.dest
* DNS.message_type
* DNS.src


#### How To Implement
This search requires that DNS data is being ingested and populating the `Network_Resolution` data model. This data can come from DNS logs or from solutions that parse network traffic for this data, such as Splunk Stream or Bro.\
This search produces fields (`dest_count`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** Distinct DNS Connections, **Field:** dest_count\
Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`

#### Known False Positives
It's possible that an enterprise has more than five DNS servers that are configured in a round-robin rotation. Please customize the search, as appropriate.
