#### Description

This analytic detects a suspicious process making a DNS query via known, abused text-paste web services, VoIP, instant messaging, and digital distribution platforms used to download external files. This technique is abused by adversaries, malware actors, and red teams to download a malicious file on the target host. This is a good TTP indicator for possible initial access techniques. A user will experience false positives if the following instant messaging is allowed or common applications like telegram or discord are allowed in the corporate network.

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Remcos](/stories/remcos)


#### How To Implement
This detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 22, DNS Query. We suggest you run this detection at least once a day over the last 14 days.

#### Required field
* _time
* Image
* QueryName
* QueryStatus
* process_name
* QueryResults
* Computer


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
Noise and false positive can be seen if the following instant messaging is allowed to use within corporate network. In this case, a filter is needed.


#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | suspicious process $process_name$ has a dns query in $QueryName$ on $Computer$ |
