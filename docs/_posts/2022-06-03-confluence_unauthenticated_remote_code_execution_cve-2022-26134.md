#### Description

The following analytic assists with identifying CVE-2022-26134 based exploitation utilizing the Web datamodel to cover network and CIM compliant web logs. The parameters were captured from live scanning and the POC provided by Rapid7. This analytic is written against multiple proof of concept codes released and seen in the wild (scanning). During triage, review any endpoint based logs for further activity including writing a jsp file to disk and commands/processes spawning running as root from the Confluence process.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **confluence_unauthenticated_remote_code_execution_cve-2022-26134_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* Web.http_method
* Web.url
* Web.url_length
* Web.src
* Web.dest
* Web.http_user_agent


#### How To Implement
This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a supported Technology Add-On like Splunk for Apache or Splunk for Nginx. In addition, network based logs or event data like PAN Threat.

#### Known False Positives
Tune based on assets if possible, or restrict to known Confluence servers. Remove the ${ for a more broad query. To identify more exec, remove everything up to the last parameter (Runtime().exec) for a broad query.
