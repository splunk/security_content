#### Description

Credential extraction is often an illegal recovery of credential material from secured authentication resources and repositories. This process may also involve decryption or other transformations of the stored credential material. Native Microsoft debuggers, such as kd, ntkd, livekd and windbg, can be leveraged to read credential material directly from memory and process dumps.

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Credential Dumping](/stories/credential_dumping)
* [Unusual Processes](/stories/unusual_processes)


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting Windows Security logs from devices of interest, including the event ID 4688 with enabled command line logging.

#### Required field
* process_name
* _time
* dest_device_id
* dest_user_id
* process


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Actions on Objectives


#### Known False Positives
Although unlikely, using debuggers this way may be indicative of developers analyzing crash dumps of their code. Note, even for developers this is an unusual way of working on code - debuggers are mostly used to step through code, not analyze its crash dumps.



#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 63.0 | 70 | 90 | Malicious actor is extracting/decoding encoded credentials via Microsoft&#39;s native debugging tools. Operation is performed at the device $dest_device_id$, by the account $dest_user_id$ via command $cmd_line$ |
