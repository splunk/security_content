#### Description

This search detects Okta login failures due to bad credentials for multiple users originating from the same ip address.

- **Type**: [TTP](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**:

#### Search

```
`okta` outcome.reason=INVALID_CREDENTIALS 
| rename client.geographicalContext.country as country, client.geographicalContext.state as state, client.geographicalContext.city as city 
| stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime dc(user) as distinct_users values(user) as users by src_ip, displayMessage, outcome.reason, country, state, city  
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
|  search distinct_users > 5
| `multiple_okta_users_with_invalid_credentials_from_the_same_ip_filter` 
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `multiple_okta_users_with_invalid_credentials_from_the_same_ip_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* outcome.reason
* client.geographicalContext.country
* client.geographicalContext.state
* client.geographicalContext.city
* user
* src_ip
* displayMessage


#### How To Implement
This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being ingested in your Splunk deployment.

#### Known False Positives
A single public IP address servicing multiple legitmate users may trigger this search. In addition, the threshold of 5 distinct users may be too low for your needs. You may modify the included filter macro `multiple_okta_users_with_invalid_credentials_from_the_same_ip_filter` to raise the threshold or except specific IP adresses from triggering this search.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | tbd |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
