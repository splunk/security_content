#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the Image, TargetObject registry key, registry Details from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.

#### Required field
* _time
* EventCode
* Image
* TargetObject
* Details
* Computer
* process_guid
* process_id
* user_id


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
3rd party tool may used to changed the wallpaper of the machine
