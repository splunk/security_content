### ⚠️ WARNING THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
We have not been able to test, simulate or build datasets for it, use at your own risk!


[Try in Splunk Security Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/cyber-security.html){: .btn .btn--success}

#### Description

This search looks for specific command-line arguments that may indicate the execution of tools made by Nirsoft, which are legitimate, but may be abused by attackers.

- **Type**: TTP
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Endpoint](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Endpoint)
- **Last Updated**: 2020-07-21
- **Author**: Bhavin Patel, Splunk
- **ID**: 1297fb80-f42a-4q4a-9c8b-78c061417cf6

#### Associated Analytic Story

#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity, including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the &#34;process&#34; field in the Endpoint data model.

#### Required field
* _time
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.user


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Installation
* Actions on Objectives


#### Known False Positives
While legitimate, these NirSoft tools are prone to abuse. You should verfiy that the tool was used for a legitimate purpose.




#### Reference


#### Test Dataset
Replay any dataset to Splunk Enterprise by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui).
Alternatively you can replay a dataset into a [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#replay-dumps-into-attack-range-splunk-server)
