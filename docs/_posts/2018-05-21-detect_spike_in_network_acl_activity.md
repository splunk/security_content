#### Description

This search will detect users creating spikes in API activity related to network access-control lists (ACLs)in your AWS environment. This search is deprecated and have been translated to use the latest Change Datamodel.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)
* [network_acl_events](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/network_acl_events.yml)

Note that `detect_spike_in_network_acl_activity_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [network_acl_activity_baseline](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/network_acl_activity_baseline.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/network_acl_activity_baseline.csv)
* [network_acl_activity_baseline](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/network_acl_activity_baseline.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/network_acl_activity_baseline.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* userIdentity.arn


#### How To Implement
You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine. The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best when you run the "Baseline of Network ACL Activity by ARN" support search once to create a lookup file of previously seen Network ACL Activity. To add or remove API event names related to network ACLs, edit the macro `network_acl_events`.

#### Known False Positives
The false-positive rate may vary based on the values of`dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold`. Please modify this according the your environment.
