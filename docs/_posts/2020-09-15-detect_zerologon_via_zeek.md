#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Detect Zerologon Attack](/stories/detect_zerologon_attack)


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting Zeek DCE-RPC data into Splunk. Zeek data should also be getting ingested in JSON format.  We are detecting when all three RPC operations (NetrServerReqChallenge, NetrServerAuthenticate3, NetrServerPasswordSet2) are splunk_security_essentials_app via bro:rpc:json.  These three operations are then correlated on the Zeek UID field.

#### Required field
* _time
* operation


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
unknown
