```
`cloudtrail` eventSource=s3.amazonaws.com eventName=PutBucketAcl 
| rex field=_raw "(?<json_field>{.+})" 
| spath input=json_field output=grantees path=requestParameters.AccessControlPolicy.AccessControlList.Grant{}

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `detect_new_open_s3_buckets_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* eventSource
* eventName
* requestParameters.bucketName
* user_arn
* userIdentity.principalId
* userAgent
* uri
* permission


#### How To Implement
You must install the AWS App for Splunk.

#### Known False Positives
While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose. That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to the "All Users" group.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 48.0 | 60 | 80 | User $user_arn$ has created an open/public bucket $bucketName$ with the following permissions $permission$ |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
