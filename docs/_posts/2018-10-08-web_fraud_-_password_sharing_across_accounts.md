#### Description

This search is used to identify user accounts that share a common password.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: 
- **Last Updated**: 2018-10-08
- **Author**: Jim Apger, Splunk
- **ID**: 31337a1a-53b9-4e05-96e9-55c934cb71d3

#### Search

```
`stream_http` http_content_type=text* uri=/magento2/customer/account/loginPost*  
| rex field=form_data "login\[username\]=(?<Username>[^&
|^$]+)" 
| rex field=form_data "login\[password\]=(?<Password>[^&
|^$]+)" 
| stats dc(Username) as UniqueUsernames values(Username) as user list(src_ip) as src_ip by Password
|where UniqueUsernames>5 
| `web_fraud___password_sharing_across_accounts_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [stream_http](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/stream_http.yml)

Note that `web_fraud_-_password_sharing_across_accounts_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* http_content_type
* uri


#### How To Implement
We need to start with a dataset that allows us to see the values of usernames and passwords that users are submitting to the website hosting the Magento2 e-commerce platform (commonly found in the HTTP form_data field). A tokenized or hashed value of a password is acceptable and certainly preferable to a clear-text password. Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs, customized IIS, and Splunk Stream.

#### Known False Positives
As is common with many fraud-related searches, we are usually looking to attribute risk or synthesize relevant context with loosely written detections that simply detect anamoluous behavior.
