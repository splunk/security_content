#### Description

This search looks for processes launching netsh.exe. Netsh is a command-line scripting utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify the network configuration of a computer that is currently running. Netsh can be used as a persistence proxy technique to execute a helper DLL when netsh.exe is executed. In this search, we are looking for processes spawned by netsh.exe and executing commands via the command line.

#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model

#### Required field
* _time
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.user
* Processes.dest


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Actions on Objectives


#### Known False Positives
Some VPN applications are known to launch netsh.exe. Outside of these instances, it is unusual for an executable to launch netsh.exe and run commands.



#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
