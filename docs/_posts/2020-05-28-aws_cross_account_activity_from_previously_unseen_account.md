#### Description

This search looks for AssumeRole events where an IAM role in a different account is requested for the first time.

```

| tstats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Authentication where Authentication.signature=AssumeRole by Authentication.vendor_account Authentication.user Authentication.src Authentication.user_role 
| `drop_dm_object_name(Authentication)`

|  where status = "New Cross Account Activity" 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
| `aws_cross_account_activity_from_previously_unseen_account_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `aws_cross_account_activity_from_previously_unseen_account_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [previously_seen_aws_cross_account_activity](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_aws_cross_account_activity.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_aws_cross_account_activity.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* Authentication.signature
* Authentication.vendor_account
* Authentication.user
* Authentication.user_role
* Authentication.src


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen AWS Cross Account Activity - Initial` to build the initial table of source IP address, geographic locations, and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen AWS Cross Account Activity - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `aws_cross_account_activity_from_previously_unseen_account_filter` macro.

#### Known False Positives
Using multiple AWS accounts and roles is perfectly valid behavior. It&#39;s suspicious when an account requests privileges of an account it hasn&#39;t before. You should validate with the account owner that this is a legitimate request.
