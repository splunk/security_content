#### Description

The following hunting analytic identifies all processes requesting access into Lsass.exe. his behavior may be related to credential dumping or applications requiring access to credentials. Triaging this event will require understanding the GrantedAccess from the SourceImage. In addition, whether the account is privileged or not. Review the process requesting permissions and review parallel processes.

| ID             | Technique        |  Tactic             |
| -------------- | ---------------- |-------------------- |
| [T1003.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/) | LSASS Memory | Credential Access |

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, TargetImage, GrantedAccess, SourceImage, SourceProcessId, SourceUser, TargetUser 
| rename Computer as dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_hunting_system_account_targeting_lsass_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

Note that `windows_hunting_system_account_targeting_lsass_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* Computer
* TargetImage
* GrantedAccess
* SourceImage
* SourceProcessId
* SourceUser
* TargetUser


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Enabling EventCode 10 TargetProcess lsass.exe is required.

#### Known False Positives
False positives will occur based on GrantedAccess and SourceUser, filter based on source image as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | A process, $SourceImage$, has loaded $ImageLoaded$ that are typically related to credential dumping on $dest$. Review for further details. |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
