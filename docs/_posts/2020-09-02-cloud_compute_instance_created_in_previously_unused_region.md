#### Description

This search looks at cloud-infrastructure events where an instance is created in any region within the last hour and then compares it to a lookup file of previously seen regions where instances have been created.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `cloud_compute_instance_created_in_previously_unused_region_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [previously_seen_cloud_regions](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cloud_regions.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cloud_regions.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* All_Changes.object_id
* All_Changes.action
* All_Changes.vendor_region
* All_Changes.user


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Initial` to build the initial table of images observed and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_in_previously_unused_region_filter` macro.

#### Known False Positives
It's possible that a user has unknowingly started an instance in a new region. Please verify that this activity is legitimate.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 42.0 | 70 | 60 | User $user$ is creating an instance $dest$ in a new region for the first time |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
