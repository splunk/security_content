#### Description

This search looks for an increase of data transfers from your email server to your clients. This could be indicative of a malicious actor collecting data using your email server.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Network_Traffic](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/NetworkTraffic)
- **Last Updated**: 2020-07-21
- **Author**: Bhavin Patel, Splunk

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `email_servers_sending_high_volume_traffic_to_hosts_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* All_Traffic.bytes_out
* All_Traffic.src_category
* All_Traffic.dest_ip


#### How To Implement
This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.  Your email servers must be categorized as "email_server" for the search to work, as well. You may need to adjust the deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples values based on the network traffic in your environment. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.

#### Known False Positives
The false-positive rate will vary based on how you set the deviation_threshold and data_samples values. Our recommendation is to adjust these values based on your network traffic to and from your email servers.
