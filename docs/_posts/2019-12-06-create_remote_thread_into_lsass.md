| -------------- | ---------------- |-------------------- |
| [T1003.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/) | LSASS Memory | Credential Access |

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventID=8 TargetImage=*lsass.exe 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, EventCode, TargetImage, TargetProcessId 
| rename Computer as dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `create_remote_thread_into_lsass_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

Note that `create_remote_thread_into_lsass_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* EventID
* TargetImage
* Computer
* EventCode
* TargetImage
* TargetProcessId
* dest


#### How To Implement
This search needs Sysmon Logs with a Sysmon configuration, which includes EventCode 8 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.

#### Known False Positives
Other tools can access LSASS for legitimate reasons and generate an event. In these cases, tweaking the search may help eliminate noise.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 81.0 | 90 | 90 | A process has created a remote thread into $TargetImage$ on $dest$. This behavior is indicative of credential dumping and should be investigated. |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`

#### Test Dataset
Replay any dataset to Splunk Enterprise by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui).
Alternatively you can replay a dataset into a [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#replay-dumps-into-attack-range-splunk-server)
