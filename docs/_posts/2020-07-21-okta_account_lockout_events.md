- **Type**: Anomaly
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: 
- **Last Updated**: 2020-07-21
- **Author**: Rico Valdez, Splunk
- **ID**: 62b70968-a0a5-4724-8ac4-67871e6f544d


#### ATT&CK

| ID          | Technique   | Tactic       |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|
| [T1078.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001/) | Default Accounts | Defense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access |


#### Search

```
`okta` displayMessage="Max sign in attempts exceeded" 
| rename client.geographicalContext.country as country, client.geographicalContext.state as state, client.geographicalContext.city as city 
| table _time, user, country, state, city, src_ip 
| `okta_account_lockout_events_filter` 
```

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Suspicious Okta Activity](/stories/suspicious_okta_activity)


#### How To Implement
This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being ingested in your Splunk deployment.

#### Required field
* _time
* displayMessage
* client.geographicalContext.country
* client.geographicalContext.state
* client.geographicalContext.city


#### Kill Chain Phase


#### Known False Positives
None. Account lockouts should be followed up on to determine if the actual user was the one who caused the lockout, or if it was an unauthorized actor.




#### Reference


#### Test Dataset
Replay any dataset to Splunk Enterprise by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui).
Alternatively you can replay a dataset into a [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#replay-dumps-into-attack-range-splunk-server)
