#### Description

This search will detect DNS requests resolved by unauthorized DNS servers. Legitimate DNS servers should be identified in the Enterprise Security Assets and Identity Framework.

- **Type**: [TTP](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/object-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Network_Resolution](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/NetworkResolution)
- **Last Updated**: 2020-07-21
- **Author**: Bhavin Patel, Splunk
- **ID**: 1a67f15a-f4ff-4170-84e9-08cf6f75d6f6


#### [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)

| ID             | Technique        |  Tactic             |
| -------------- | ---------------- |-------------------- |
| [T1071.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004/) | DNS | Command And Control |

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Resolution where DNS.dest_category != dns_server AND DNS.src_category != dns_server by DNS.src DNS.dest 
| `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")` 
| `dns_query_requests_resolved_by_unauthorized_dns_servers_filter` 
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

Note that `dns_query_requests_resolved_by_unauthorized_dns_servers_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* DNS.dest_category
* DNS.src_category
* DNS.src
* DNS.dest


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you will need to ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. It also requires that your DNS servers are identified correctly in the Assets and Identity table of Enterprise Security.

#### Known False Positives
Legitimate DNS activity can be detected in this search. Investigate, verify and update the list of authorized DNS servers as appropriate.
