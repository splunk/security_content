#### Search

```
`signals` 
| fillnull 
| stats sum(risk_score) as risk_score values(source) as signals values(user) as user by repository 
| sort - risk_score 
| where risk_score > 80 
| `correlation_by_repository_and_risk_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [signals](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/signals.yml)

Note that `correlation_by_repository_and_risk_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time


#### How To Implement
For Dev Sec Ops POC

#### Known False Positives
unknown

#### Associated Analytic story
* [Dev Sec Ops](/stories/dev_sec_ops)


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Actions on Objectives



#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 70.0 | 70 | 100 | Correlation triggered for user $user$ |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
