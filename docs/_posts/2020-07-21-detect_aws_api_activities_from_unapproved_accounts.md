#### Description

This search looks for successful AWS CloudTrail activity by user accounts that are not listed in the identity table or `aws_service_accounts.csv`. It returns event names and count, as well as the first and last time a specific user or service is detected, grouped by users. Deprecated because managing this list can be quite hard.

#### Search

```
`cloudtrail` errorCode=success 
| rename userName as identity 
| search NOT [
| inputlookup identity_lookup_expanded 
| fields identity] 
| search NOT [
| inputlookup aws_service_accounts 
| fields identity]

| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(eventName) as eventName by user 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `detect_aws_api_activities_from_unapproved_accounts_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `detect_aws_api_activities_from_unapproved_accounts_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [aws_service_accounts](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/aws_service_accounts.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/aws_service_accounts.csv)

#### Required field
* _time
* errorCode
* userName
* eventName
* user


#### How To Implement
You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail inputs. You must also populate the `identity_lookup_expanded` lookup shipped with the Asset and Identity framework to be able to look up users in your identity table in Enterprise Security (ES). Leverage the support search called "Create a list of approved AWS service accounts": run it once every 30 days to create and validate a list of service accounts.\
This search produces fields (`eventName`,`firstTime`,`lastTime`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** AWS Event Name, **Field:** eventName\
1. \
1. **Label:** First Time, **Field:** firstTime\
1. \
1. **Label:** Last Time, **Field:** lastTime\
Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`

#### Known False Positives
It's likely that you'll find activity detected by users/service accounts that are not listed in the `identity_lookup_expanded` or ` aws_service_accounts.csv` file. If the user is a legitimate service account, update the `aws_service_accounts.csv` table with that entry.
