#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [gsuite_drive](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/gsuite_drive.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `gsuite_suspicious_shared_file_name_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* parameters.doc_title
* src_domain
* dest_domain
* email
* parameters.visibility
* parameters.owner
* parameters.doc_type


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc. In order for the search to work for your environment, please edit the query to use your company specific email domain instead of `internal_test_email.com`.

#### Known False Positives
normal user or normal transaction may contain the subject and file type attachment that this detection try to search

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 21.0 | 30 | 70 | suspicious share gdrive from $parameters.owner$ to $email$ namely as $parameters.doc_title$ |


Note that risk score is calculated base on the following formula: `(Impact * Confidence)/100`
