#### Search

```

| from datamodel Identity_Management.All_Identities  
| eval empStatus=case((now()-startDate)<604800, "Accounts created in last week") 
| search empStatus="Accounts created in last week"
| `security_content_ctime(endDate)` 
| `security_content_ctime(startDate)`
| table identity empStatus endDate startDate 
| `identify_new_user_accounts_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

Note that `identify_new_user_accounts_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be populating the Enterprise Security Identity_Management data model in the assets and identity framework.

#### Known False Positives
If the Identity_Management data model is not updated regularly, this search could give you false positive alerts. Please consider this and investigate appropriately.
