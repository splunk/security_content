#### Description

This search detects a suspicioous termination of known services killed by ransomware before encrypting files in a compromised machine. This technique is commonly seen in most of ransomware now a days to avoid exception error while accessing the targetted files it wants to encrypts because of the open handle of those services to the targetted file.

#### Search

```
`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7036 Message IN ("*Volume Shadow Copy*","*VSS*", "*backup*", "*sophos*", "*sql*", "*memtas*", "*mepocs*", "*veeam*", "*svc$*") Message="*service entered the stopped state*" 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Message dest Type 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `known_services_killed_by_ransomware_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [wineventlog_system](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_system.yml)

Note that `known_services_killed_by_ransomware_filter` is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Required field
* _time
* EventCode
* Message
* dest
* Type


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the 7036 EventCode ScManager in System audit Logs from your endpoints.

#### Known False Positives
Admin activities or installing related updates may do a sudden stop to list of services we monitor.
