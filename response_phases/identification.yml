description: Events are occurances of a systems or systems. Incidents are declared
  violations and incidents can occur in countless ways. Detection and analysis phase
  is about identifying an event as an incident and properly categorizing and prioritizing
  incident notification and documentation. It is infeasible to develop step-by-step
  instructions for handling every incident. This generic detection and analysis process
  is a template to ensure the right process is being followed.
