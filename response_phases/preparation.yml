description: Incident response methodologies typically emphasize preparation not only
  for establishing an incident response capability so that the organization is ready
  to respond to incidents, but also preventing incidents by ensuring that systems,
  networks, and applications are sufficiently secure. Incident response teams need
  to know what they have available and what they need to prepare, aquire or configure
  for success within the incident response process.
