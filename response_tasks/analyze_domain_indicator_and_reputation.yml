workflow:
  1. Review 'Analysis of Indicator <indicator> | Threat <threat_level>| Confidence <conf_level>'. This report provides intelligence, Sandbox reputation, and additional information like domain whois.
  2. While reviewing the note data your are confirm and looking for indications of APT, known malware references
    * APT - Looking for references to APT naming (APT29 or such) or codeword like namings
    * Malware - Looking for reference to known malware campaigns or intrusions
    * Suspicious - Would be any whois information that appears suspicious like recently registered domain names
    * Allowed - Authorized business endpoint or Content Delivery Service address
    * Undetermined - Indicator with no information or any data about indicator
  3. Threat Level should be based on known indications.
    * APT - Critical
    * Malware - High
    * Suspicous - Medium
    * Allowed - Low
    * Undetermined - Low
  4. Threat Confidence should be based on the number of confirmed resources you could use to collaborate your assessment
  5. Lastly, provide any commentary on why the level changed from the automate analysis.
