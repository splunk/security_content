description: This search helps an analyst investigate a notable event related to a
  potential Apache Struts exploitation. To investigate, we will want to isolate and
  analyze the "payload" or the commands that were passed to the vulnerable hosts by
  creating a few regular expressions to carve out the commands focusing on common
  keywords from the payload, such as cmd.exe, /bin/bash and whois. The search returns
  these suspicious strings found in the HTTP logs of the system of interest.
how_to_implement: This particular search leverages data extracted from Stream:HTTP.
  You must configure the http stream using the Splunk Stream App on your Splunk Stream
  deployment server to extract the cs_content_type field.
