description: This search hunts for dumped NTLM hashes used for pass the hash.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need be ingesting windows
  security logs. This search uses an input macro named `wineventlog_security`. We
  strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index,
  source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Security logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
