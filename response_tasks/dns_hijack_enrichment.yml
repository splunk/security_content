description: 'This Playbook is part of the Splunk Analytic Story called DNS Hijacking.
  It is made to be run when the Detection Search within that story called "DNS Record
  Changed" is used to identify DNS record changes for cloud and corporate domains
  used in your environment. The detection search is dependent on a support searched
  called "Discover DNS Records" which finds the common DNS responses for the last
  30 days of monitored corporate domains and cloud providers (located in lookups:
  cim_corporate_email_domains.csv, cim_corporate_web_domains.csv, and cloud_domains.csv
  from Splunk CIM App). These responses are stored under the lookup called discovered_dns_records.csv.
  The playbook starts with the changed DNS records and uses MaxMind, whois, Censys,
  Malware Domain List, and PassiveTotal to gather attributes of the DNS records for
  comparison against expected values. The resulting enrichment is displayed in Mission
  Control and posted back to the Notable Event in Splunk ES.'
how_to_implement: 'If Splunk>Phantom is also configured in your environment, a Playbook
  called "DNS Hijack Enrichment" can be configured to run when any results are found
  by this detection search. The playbook takes in the DNS record changed and uses
  Geoip, whois, Censys and PassiveTotal to detect if DNS issuers changed. To use this
  integration, install the Phantom App for Splunk `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/`,
  add the correct hostname to the "Phantom Instance" field in the Adaptive Response
  Actions when configuring this detection search, and set the corresponding Playbook
  to active. \
