workflow: |
  This task is a default accept task and allows the analyst to start the response process and start the timer for mean time to detect (MTTD).  This allows measurement of analyst review and acceptance of the task at hand.  This can be superceded by assign other tasks to individuals (if the owner is coordinating processor).  The event owner can accept the event, and then retask other sub-phase and/or task to other individuals or teams.  This is considered a procedural or policy task.
