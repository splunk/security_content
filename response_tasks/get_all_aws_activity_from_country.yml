id: e763cdb9-00da-41e0-9bda-444debc9501a
version: 1
date: '2018-03-19'
description: This search retrieves all the activity from a specific country and will
  create a table containing the time, country, ARN, username, the type of user, the
  source IP address, the AWS region the activity was in, the API called, and whether
  or not the API call was successful.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
