workflow: Make sure that the response actions have been performed during an internal exercise by your Incident Response Team.
  You need to make sure that when an Incident happens, the team understands the how and this is not the first time they have seen the tasks. This is best done by being able to execute the actual steps in **your environment**, i.e. blocking an IP address or a domain name.
