description: This Playbook is part of the Splunk Analytic Story called Account Monitoring
  and Controls. It is made to be run when the Detection Search within that story called
  "Detect Excessive Account Lockouts From Endpoint" is used to identify a potential
  attack in which multiple Active Directory user accounts are locked out from logging
  in because an adversary attempted incorrect credentials repeatedly against many
  user accounts. This Playbook runs the Context-gathering and Investigative searches
  linked in the Splunk Analytic Story to enrich the event with a broad array of information
  about the users and computers involved. Then the Playbook uses Windows Remote Management
  to login to the source of the lockouts, gather more information, and allow Phantom
  to shutdown the server after prompting an analyst or responder.
