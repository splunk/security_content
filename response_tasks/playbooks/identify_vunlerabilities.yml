workflow: |
  1. Scan host(s) with infection and determine any vulnerabilities that can remediate infection. (e.g. finding a SMB MS17-010 - Windows SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability)
  2. Identify any common vulnerabilities among the hosts infected
  3. Reverse engineer malware for any zero day vulnerabilities.
