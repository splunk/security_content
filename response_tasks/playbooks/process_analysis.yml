description: Use Windows Log Source data for the process.
Use process path or %APPDATA% path and determine parent process compromise of either Root/Admin or user.
- AppData is inherently user access only finding whether browser or outlook was used
- \AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default is for Edge and MSIE for Internet explorer (personal email or drive by download)
- \Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook for Outlook (phishing)

Process Info Detail
 - Parent process id and name either from Splunk or supporting EDR tooling
 - Recommend to use sysmon or sysinterals tools for windows environments
 Splunk Process data

 - Run Splunk search(s) for process data
Network connections from the process
- Manually use netstat -naob to collect connections
 -  Create additional artifacts for domain, ip and urls found associated to the process (if not already there)

Security context for process
 - Use sysinternals process explorer, if you don't a tool set to accomplish this.
 - Search Splunk for process information if collected.
 - Collect User Id or security context to processes found in process tree

Create one note with structured objects for each area above - who, what, where, how and assess why it was called
Outcome
- Determine if malware, standard installer, suspicious, administrative type of activity

workflow: Process analysis is a flow analysis of what started the root cause to end activities.  Not all the time will you find everything you need. The order of volitility will remove some artifacts for you and you will have to look at more data to make a forensically acccurate decision.  However, not every investigation can be deeply and throughly executed.  We must triage (assign degrees of urgency to) our investigations and identify the worst and act quickly and to the best of our abiliites.
Order of volitility
- Cache, registers
- ARP cache, routing table, memory, kernel statistics, process table
- Temporary files
- Disk
- Monitoring data and remote logging pertaining to the computer in question
- Physical configurations, network topology
- Archival media
When possible you want to capture forensically valuable data as soon as the event occurs.  Items like memory, hibernation states, network pcaps and some disk files will help you review content after you may have dispositioned the system.
