description: |
  Depending on the sized of the incident, reimaging systems maybe a viable eradication and recovery process combined. Once restored to gold image (standardized corporate image) with immediate patching and updating of all known vulnerabilities. Create a service request for the Help Desk to re-image the host. Server or network equipment should be baselined and restored by the owning team.

requirements:
workflow: |
  1. Create a request for re-imaging system for eradication and recovery. Re-imaging will not be possible in a mass incident.
  2. For mass incidents, provide immediate patching and reporting of non-compliant patching or antivirus removal tools.  Thorough forensic and reverse malware engineering will provide the necessary details to minimize complete recovery processes.
  3. Do not restore localized customer files (/home/user, or /User/<username>), but only on a case by case basis and thorough review of the files being restored.
  4. If the eradication process isn't reducing the number of infected hosts, eradication is missing a persistence mechanism or containment has failed.
