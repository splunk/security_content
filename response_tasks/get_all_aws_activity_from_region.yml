id: 5b794bef-1743-4f6f-804a-43915a2702ff
version: 1
date: '2018-03-19'
description: This search retrieves all the activity from a specific geographic region
  and will create a table containing the time, geographic region, ARN, username, the
  type of user, the source IP address, the AWS region the activity was in, the API
  called, and whether or not the API call was successful.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
