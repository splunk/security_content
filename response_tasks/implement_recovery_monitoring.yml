description: |
  Newly recovered systems should have additional monitoring for any anomalies or newly created incidents.  Adding single host to a previously infected list for a specified period will allow the incident responder to quickly assess a re-infection or subsequent new infection. At this stage in recovery, you should be unquarantining devices and removing any host blocks.

  1. Monitor restored systems for any new anomalies and ensure that operations have been returned to normal
  2. Begin to remove emergency blocks to permanent block and remediation alerts for infected systems returning the network (e.g. laptops that were unreachable during the incident)
