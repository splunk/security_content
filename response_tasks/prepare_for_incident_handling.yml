workflow: |
    ## Incident Handler Communications and Facilities:
    * Contact information for team members and others within and outside the organization (primary and backup contacts), such as law enforcement and other incident response teams; information may include phone numbers, email addresses, public encryption keys (in accordance with the encryption software described below), and instructions for verifying the contacts identity
    * On-call information for other teams within the organization, including escalation information
    * Incident reporting mechanisms, such as phone numbers, email addresses, online forms, and secure instant messaging systems that users can use to report suspected incidents; at least one mechanism should permit people to report incidents anonymously
    * Issue tracking system for tracking incident information, status, etc.
    * Smartphones to be carried by team members for off-hour support and onsite communications
    * Encryption software to be used for communications among team members, within the organization and with external parties; for Federal agencies, software must use a FIPS-validated encryption algorithm20
    * War room for central communication and coordination; if a permanent war room is not necessary or practical, the team should create a procedure for procuring a temporary war room when needed
    * Secure storage facility for securing evidence and other sensitive materials
    ## Incident Analysis Hardware and Software
    * Digital forensic workstations21 and/or backup devices to create disk images, preserve log files, and save other relevant incident data
    * Laptops for activities such as analyzing data, sniffing packets, and writing reports
    * Spare workstations, servers, and networking equipment, or the virtualized equivalents, which may be used for many purposes, such as restoring backups and trying out malware
    * Blank removable media
    * Portable printer to print copies of log files and other evidence from non-networked systems
    * Packet sniffers and protocol analyzers to capture and analyze network traffic
    * Digital forensic software to analyze disk images
    * Removable media with trusted versions of programs to be used to gather evidence from systems
    * Evidence gathering accessories, including hard-bound notebooks, digital cameras, audio recorders, chain of custody forms, evidence storage bags and tags, and evidence tape, to preserve evidence for possible legal actions
    ## Incident Analysis Resources:
    * Port lists, including commonly used ports and Trojan horse ports
    * Documentation for OSs, applications, protocols, and intrusion detection and antivirus products Network diagrams and lists of critical assets, such as database servers
    * Current baselines of expected network, system, and application activity
    * Cryptographic hashes of critical files22 to speed incident analysis, verification, and eradication
    ## Incident Mitigation Software:
    * Access to images of clean OS and application installations for restoration and recovery purposes
