description: While investigating, an analyst will want to know what process and parent_process
  is responsible for generating suspicious DNS traffic. Use the following search and
  enter the value of `dest` in the search to get specific details on the process responsible
  for creating the DNS traffic.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that associates processes with
  network events into the Endpoint datamodel. This can come from endpoint protection
  products such as carbon black, or endpoint data sources such as Sysmon.
