description: This search helps an analyst investigate a notable event to find out
  more about a specific web session. The search looks for a specific web session ID
  in the HTTP web traffic and outputs the URL and user agents, grouped by source IP
  address and HTTP status code.
how_to_implement: This search leverages data extracted from Stream:HTTP. You must
  configure the HTTP stream using the Splunk Stream App on your Splunk Stream deployment
  server.
