description: 'This search calculates the ratio of DNS traffic originating and coming
  from a host to a list of DNS servers over the last 24 hours. A high value of this
  ratio could be very useful to quickly understand if a src_ip (host) is sending a
  high volume of data out via port 53, could be an indicator of data exfiltration
  via DNS.  '
