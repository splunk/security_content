id: 0abeeb40-1255-4b68-91d1-7a7eb410c4b8
version: 1
date: '2018-03-19'
description: This search retrieves all the activity from a specific city and will
  create a table containing the time, city, ARN, username, the type of user, the source
  IP address, the AWS region the activity was in, the API called, and whether or not
  the API call was successful.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
