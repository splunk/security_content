description: This search queries the notable index to retrieve detailed information
  captured within the notable. Every notable has a unique ID associated with it, which
  is used to point us directly to the notable event under investigation.
how_to_implement: If you are using Enterprise Security you are likely already creating
  notable events with your correlation rules. No additional configuration is necessary.
