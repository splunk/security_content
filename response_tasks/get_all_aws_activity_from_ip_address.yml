version: 1
date: '2018-03-19'
description: This search retrieves all the activity from a specific IP address and
  will create a table containing the time, ARN, username, the type of user, the IP
  address, the AWS region the activity was in, the API called, and whether or not
  the API call was successful.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
