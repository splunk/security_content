description: This search provides investigation data about requests via user agent,
  authentication request URI, resource path and cluster name data against Kubernetes
  cluster from a specific IP address
how_to_implement: You must install the GCP App for Splunk (version 2.0.0 or later),
  then configure stackdriver and set a Pub/Sub subscription to be imported to Splunk.
  You must also install Cloud Infrastructure data model.Customize the macro kubernetes_gcp_scan_fingerprint_attack_detection
  to filter out FPs.
