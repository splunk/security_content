description: Investigate an email with a suspicious file attachment detected by Splunk
  Enterprise Security. Detonate the file attachment in a sandbox, gather network behavior
  from the sandbox results, and pivot on those network indicators with both external
  reputation queries and internal Splunk Common Information Model searches. After
  confirming the results with an analyst prompt, delete the email from the user's
  inbox, hopefully before they have opened it.
how_to_implement: Synchronize the community playbook repository in Phantom, then open
  the playbook and follow the deployment notes to configure it for your environment.
