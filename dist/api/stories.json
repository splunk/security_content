Employing numerous tactics and techniques, these attacks continue to escalate in complexity. \\\nThere is a wide range of motivations for these state-sponsored hacks, including stealing valuable corporate, military, or diplomatic data&#1151;all of which could confer advantages in various arenas. They may also target critical infrastructure. \\\nOne joint Technical Alert (TA) issued by the Department of Homeland and the FBI in mid-March of 2018 attributed some cyber activity targeting utility infrastructure to operatives sponsored by the Russian government. The hackers executed spearfishing attacks, installed malware, employed watering-hole domains, and more. While they caused no physical damage, the attacks provoked fears that a nation-state could turn off water, redirect power, or compromise a nuclear power plant.\\\nSuspicious activities--spikes in SMB traffic, processes that launch netsh (to modify the network configuration), suspicious registry modifications, and many more--may all be events you may wish to investigate further. While the use of these technique may be an indication that a nation-state actor is attempting to compromise your environment, it is important to note that these techniques are often employed by other groups, as well.", "references": ["https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A"], "tags": {"analytic_story": "DHS Report TA18-074A", "category": ["Malware"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_id": ["T1059.001", "T1136", "T1547.001", "T1071", "T1053", "T1204", "T1543.003", "T1136.001", "T1059", "T1569.002", "T1071.002", "T1204.002", "T1562.004", "T1112", "T1021", "T1543", "T1562", "T1021.002", "T1547", "T1053.005", "T1569"], "mitre_attack_technique": ["Scheduled Task/Job", "PowerShell", "Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder", "Remote Services", "User Execution", "SMB/Windows Admin Shares", "Scheduled Task", "Windows Service", "Create Account", "Impair Defenses", "Malicious File", "Disable or Modify System Firewall", "Create or Modify System Process", "Application Layer Protocol", "System Services", "File Transfer Protocols", "Command and Scripting Interpreter", "Local Account", "Service Execution", "Modify Registry", "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution"], "mitre_attack_tactics": ["Privilege Escalation", "Lateral Movement", "Command And Control", "Defense Evasion", "Persistence", "Execution"], "mitre_attack_groups": ["APT38", "Gorgon Group", "Magic Hound", "Turla", "CopyKittens", "FIN6", "The White Company", "Carbanak", "Deep Panda", "RTM", "Frankenstein", "Kimsuky", "DarkHydrus", "OilRig", "Whitefly", "APT41", "Gallmaker", "BlackTech", "APT37", "Threat Group-3390", "Soft Cell", "FIN8", "Gamaredon Group", "Mofang", "Darkhotel", "Lazarus Group", "APT32", "menuPass", "Machete", "Honeybee", "FIN7", "APT18", "DarkVishnya", "Blue Mockingbird", "Sharpshooter", "Rancor", "Poseidon Group", "Orangeworm", "APT29", "admin@338", "Elderwood", "Putter Panda", "Leviathan", "MuddyWater", "APT-C-36", "Naikon", "APT3", "Rocke", "Inception", "Wizard Spider", "Silence", "BRONZE BUTLER", "SilverTerrier", "TA505", "FIN4", "Dark Caracal", "APT28", "Ke3chang", "APT33", "TA459", "APT12", "Thrip", "APT19", "Leafminer", "Sandworm Team", "Dragonfly 2.0", "Tropic Trooper", "TEMP.Veles", "Cobalt Group", "Patchwork", "WIRTE", "APT39", "no", "FIN5", "FIN10", "Molerats", "PLATINUM", "Windshift", "Threat Group-1314", "Stealth Falcon"]}, "type": "", "detections": [{"name": "SMB Traffic Spike", "id": "7f5fb3e1-4209-4914-90db-0ec21b936378", "version": 3, "date": "2020-07-22", "author": "David Dorsey, Splunk", "type": "Anomaly", "datamodel": ["Network_Traffic"], "description": "This search looks for spikes in the number of Server Message Block (SMB) traffic connections.", "search": "| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.dest_port=139 OR All_Traffic.dest_port=445 OR All_Traffic.app=smb by _time span=1h, All_Traffic.src | `drop_dm_object_name(\"All_Traffic\")` | eventstats max(_time) as maxtime | stats count as num_data_samples max(eval(if(_time >= relative_time(maxtime, \"-70m@m\"), count, null))) as count avg(eval(if(_time<relative_time(maxtime, \"-70m@m\"), count, null))) as avg stdev(eval(if(_time<relative_time(maxtime, \"-70m@m\"), count, null))) as stdev by src | eval upperBound=(avg+stdev*2), isOutlier=if(count > upperBound AND num_data_samples >=50, 1, 0) | where isOutlier=1 | table src count | `smb_traffic_spike_filter` ", "how_to_implement": "This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic logs and populating the `Network_Traffic` data model.", "known_false_positives": "A file server may experience high-demand loads that could cause this analytic to trigger.", "references": [], "tags": {"analytic_story": ["Emotet Malware  DHS Report TA18-201A ", "Hidden Cobra Malware", "Ransomware", "DHS Report TA18-074A"], "asset_type": "Endpoint", "cis20": ["CIS 8"], "kill_chain_phases": ["Actions on Objectives"], "mitre_attack_id": ["T1021.002", "T1021"], "nist": ["DE.CM"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "required_fields": ["_time", "All_Traffic.dest_port", "All_Traffic.app", "All_Traffic.src"], "security_domain": "network", "mitre_attack_technique": ["SMB/Windows Admin Shares", "Remote Services"], "mitre_attack_tactics": ["Lateral Movement", "Lateral Movement"], "mitre_attack_groups": ["Blue Mockingbird", "APT39", "APT32", "Orangeworm", "FIN8", "APT3", "Lazarus Group", "Threat Group-1314", "Turla", "Deep Panda", "Ke3chang", "no"]}, "macros": [{"definition": "summariesonly=false allow_old_summaries=true", "description": "search data model's summaries only", "name": "security_content_summariesonly"}, {"definition": "search *", "description": "Update this macro to limit the output results to filter out false positives.

MSHTML is a software component used to render web pages on Windows. Although it\u2019s most commonly associated with Internet Explorer, it is also used in other software.  CVE-2021-40444 received a CVSS score of 8.8 out of 10. MSHTML is the beating heart of Internet Explorer, the vulnerability also exists in that browser. Although given its limited use, there is little risk of infection by that vector. Microsoft Office applications use the MSHTML component to display web content in Office documents. The attack depends on MSHTML loading a specially crafted ActiveX control when the target opens a malicious Office document. The loaded ActiveX control can then run arbitrary code to infect the system with more malware. \\ At the moment all supported Windows versions are vulnerable. Since there is no patch available yet, Microsoft proposes a few methods to block these attacks. \\\n1. Disable the installation of all ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer via the registry. Previously-installed ActiveX controls will still run, but no new ones will be added, including malicious ones. \\\n1. Open documents from the Internet in Protected View or Application Guard for Office, both of which prevent the current attack.

It can be as specific as an IP address or a city, or as broad as a region (think state) or an entire country. By determining how precise you want your geographical locations to be and monitoring for new locations that haven't previously accessed your environment, you can detect adversaries as they begin to probe your environment.

However, according to a joint technical alert (TA) issued by three government agencies (https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A), Emotet has evolved far beyond those beginnings to become what a ThreatPost article called a threat-delivery service(see https://threatpost.com/emotet-malware-evolves-beyond-banking-to-threat-delivery-service/134342/).  For example, in early 2018, Emotet was found to be using its loader function to spread the Quakbot and Ransomware variants. \\\nAccording to the TA, the the malware continues to be among the most costly and destructive malware affecting the private and public sectors. Researchers have linked it to the threat group Mealybug, which has also been on the security communitys radar since 2014.\\\nThe searches in this Analytic Story will help you find executables that are rarely used in your environment, specific registry paths that malware often uses to ensure survivability and persistence, instances where cmd.exe is used to launch script interpreters, and other indicators that Emotet or other malware has compromised your environment.

The file is executed using Wscript.\\\nThe MUDCARP techniques include the use of the compressed-folders module from Microsoft, zipfldr.dll, with RouteTheCall export to run the malicious process or command. After a successful reboot, the malware is made persistent by a manipulating `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run]'help'='c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\rundll32.exe c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall c:\\\\programdata\\\\winapp.exe'`. Though this technique is not exclusive to MUDCARP, it has been spotted in the group's arsenal of advanced techniques seen in the wild.\\\nThis Analytic Story searches for evidence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that allow for the use of a endpoint detection-and-response (EDR) bypass technique to mask the true parent of a malicious process. It can also be set as a registry key for further sandbox evasion and to allow the malware to launch only after reboot.\\\nIf behavioral searches included in this story yield positive hits, iDefense recommends conducting IOC searches for the following:\\\n\\\n1. www.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. about.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. autoconfig.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. autodiscover.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. catalog.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. cpanel.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. db.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. ftp.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. mail.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. news.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. update.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. webmail.chemscalere[.]com\\\n1. www.candlelightparty[.]org\\\n1. candlelightparty[.]org\\\n1. newapp.freshasianews[.]comIn addition, iDefense also recommends that organizations review their environments for activity related to the following hashes:\\\n\\\n1. cd195ee448a3657b5c2c2d13e9c7a2e2\\\n1. b43ad826fe6928245d3c02b648296b43\\\n1. 889a9b52566448231f112a5ce9b5dfaf\\\n1. b8ec65dab97cdef3cd256cc4753f0c54\\\n1. 04d83cd3813698de28cfbba326d7647c", "references": ["https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/scope-of-mudcarp-attacks-highlight-1/", "http://blog.amossys.fr/badflick-is-not-so-bad.html"], "tags": {"analytic_story": "Possible Backdoor Activity Associated With MUDCARP Espionage Campaigns", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_id": ["T1059.001", "T1059", "T1547.001", "T1547"], "mitre_attack_technique": ["PowerShell", "Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder", "Command and Scripting Interpreter", "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution"], "mitre_attack_tactics": ["Persistence", "Execution", "Privilege Escalation"], "mitre_attack_groups": ["APT41", "APT33", "Ke3chang", "Gallmaker", "TA459", "APT29", "Gorgon Group", "Magic Hound", "Turla", "Thrip", "APT19", "Putter Panda", "Leviathan", "APT37", "Threat Group-3390", "MuddyWater", "Soft Cell", "FIN8", "CopyKittens", "APT3", "Gamaredon Group", "Darkhotel", "Dragonfly 2.0", "Lazarus Group", "Rocke", "APT32", "FIN6", "menuPass", "Inception", "Wizard Spider", "Deep Panda", "Tropic Trooper", "TEMP.Veles", "RTM", "Machete", "Silence", "Frankenstein", "Kimsuky", "Cobalt Group", "BRONZE BUTLER", "Honeybee", "WIRTE", "Patchwork", "DarkHydrus", "FIN7", "APT18", "APT39", "DarkVishnya", "no", "TA505", "Dark Caracal", "FIN5", "Blue Mockingbird", "Sharpshooter", "APT28", "FIN10", "Molerats", "Poseidon Group", "OilRig", "Stealth Falcon", "Whitefly"]}, "type": "", "detections": [{"name": "Unusually Long Command Line - MLTK", "id": "57edaefa-a73b-45e5-bbae-f39c1473f941", "version": 1, "date": "2019-05-08", "author": "Rico Valdez, Splunk", "type": "Anomaly", "datamodel": [], "description": "Command lines that are extremely long may be indicative of malicious activity on your hosts.

Writing analytics against all systems when those behaviors are limited to identifiable subsets of those systems is suboptimal. Consider the case ProxyShell vulnerability on Microsoft Exchange Servers. With asset information, a hunter can limit their analytics to systems that have been identified as Exchange servers. A hunter may start with the theory that the exchange server is communicating with new systems that it has not previously.

Some of the malicious behaviors involved may include inserting spaces before file extensions or prepending the file extension with a different one, among other techniques.", "narrative": "Attackers use a variety of techniques to entice users to run malicious code or to persist on an endpoint. One way to accomplish these goals is to leverage file extensions and the mechanism Windows uses to associate files with specific applications. \\\n Since its earliest days, Windows has used extensions to identify file types. Users have become familiar with these extensions and their application associations. For example, if users see that a file ends in `.doc` or `.docx`, they will assume that it is a Microsoft Word document and expect that double-clicking will open it using `winword.exe`. The user will typically also presume that the `.docx` file is safe. \\\n Attackers take advantage of this expectation by obfuscating the true file extension. They can accomplish this in a couple of ways. One technique involves inserting multiple spaces in the file name before the extension to hide the extension from the GUI, obscuring the true nature of the file. Another approach involves prepending the real extension with a different one. This is especially effective when Windows is configured to \"hide extensions for known file types.\" In this case, the real extension is not displayed, but the prepended one is, leading end users to believe the file is a different type than it actually is.\\\nChanging the association between a file extension and an application can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The technique typically involves changing the association for an often-launched file type to associate instead with a malicious program the attacker has dropped on the endpoint. When the end user launches a file that has been manipulated in this way, it will execute the attacker's malware. It will also execute the application the end user expected to run, cleverly obscuring the fact that something suspicious has occurred.\\\nRun the searches in this story to detect and investigate suspicious behavior that may indicate abuse or manipulation of Windows file extensions and/or associations.", "references": ["https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2013/12/file-extensions-2/", "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1042"], "tags": {"analytic_story": "Windows File Extension and Association Abuse", "category": ["Malware"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_id": ["T1036.003", "T1036"], "mitre_attack_technique": ["Rename System Utilities", "Masquerading"], "mitre_attack_tactics": ["Defense Evasion"], "mitre_attack_groups": ["APT32", "menuPass", "Soft Cell", "Dragonfly 2.0", "PLATINUM", "Windshift", "BRONZE BUTLER"]}, "type": "", "detections": [{"name": "Execution of File with Multiple Extensions", "id": "b06a555e-dce0-417d-a2eb-28a5d8d66ef7", "version": 3, "date": "2020-11-18", "author": "Rico Valdez, Splunk", "type": "TTP", "datamodel": ["Endpoint"], "description": "This search looks for processes launched from files that have double extensions in the file name.

It is helpful to understand how often the notable events generated by this story occur, as well as the commonalities between some of these events. These factors may provide clues about whether this is a common occurrence of minimal concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation. Likewise, it is important to determine whether the issue is restricted to a single user/system or is broader in scope. \\\nThe following factors may assist you in determining whether the event is malicious: \\\n1. Country of origin \\\n1. Responsible party \\\n1. Fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address \\\n1. Registration of fully qualified domain names associated with external IP address \\\nDetermining whether it is a dynamic domain frequently visited by others and/or how third parties categorize it can also help you answer some questions surrounding the attacker and details related to the external system. In addition, there are various sources--such as VirusTotal&#151; that can provide some reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist in determining whether the event is malicious. Finally, determining whether there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect data points or show other events that should be brought into scope. \\\nGathering data on the system of interest can sometimes help you quickly determine whether something suspicious is happening. Some of these items include finding out who else may have recently logged into the system, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted. \\\nOften, a simple inspection of the process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if `svchost.exe` is found running from a location other than `C:\\Windows\\System32`, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when cursorily reviewing process names. Similarly, if the process itself seems legitimate, but the parent process is running from the temporary browser cache, that could be indicative of activity initiated via a compromised website a user visited. \\\nIt can also be very helpful to examine various behaviors of the process of interest or the parent of the process of interest. For example, if it turns out the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see if the parent to that process spawned other processes that might be worth further scrutiny. If a process is suspect, a review of the network connections made in and around the time of the event and/or whether the process spawned any child processes could be helpful, as well. \\\nIn the event a system is suspected of having been compromised via a malicious website, we suggest reviewing the browsing activity from that system around the time of the event. If categories are given for the URLs visited, that can help you zero in on possible malicious sites. \\\nMost recently we have added new content related to PowerShell Script Block logging, Windows EventCode 4104. Script block logging presents the deobfuscated and raw script executed on an endpoint. The analytics produced were tested against commonly used attack frameworks - PowerShell-Empire, Cobalt Strike and Covenant. In addition, we sampled publicly available samples that utilize PowerShell and validated coverage. The analytics are here to identify suspicious usage, cmdlets, or script values. 4104 events are enabled via the Windows registry and may generate a large volume of data if enabled globally. Enabling on critical systems or a limited set may be best. During triage of 4104 events, review parallel processes for other processes and command executed. Identify any file modifications and network communication and review accordingly.

IAM provides the ability to create and manage AWS users, groups, and roles-each with their own unique set of privileges and defined access to specific resources (such as EC2 instances, the AWS Management Console, API, or the command-line interface). Unlike conventional (human) users, IAM roles are assumable by anyone in the organization. They provide users with dynamically created temporary security credentials that expire within a set time period.\\\nHerein lies the rub. In between the time between when the temporary credentials are issued and when they expire is a period of opportunity, where a user could leverage the temporary credentials to wreak havoc-spin up or remove instances, create new users, elevate privileges, and other malicious activities-throughout the environment.\\\nThis Analytic Story includes searches that will help you monitor your AWS CloudTrail logs for evidence of suspicious cross-account activity.

Three additional vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065) were also identified as part of this activity.

Samas or SamsamCrypt) was launched in 2015 by a group of Iranian threat actors. The malicious software has affected and continues to affect thousands of victims and has raised almost $6M in ransom.\\\nAlthough categorized under the heading of ransomware, SamSam campaigns have some importance distinguishing characteristics. Most notable is the fact that conventional ransomware is a numbers game. Perpetrators use a \"spray-and-pray\" approach with phishing campaigns or other mechanisms, charging a small ransom (typically under $1,000). The goal is to find a large number of victims willing to pay these mini-ransoms, adding up to a lucrative payday. They use relatively simple methods for infecting systems.\\\nSamSam attacks are different beasts. They have become progressively more targeted and skillful than typical ransomware attacks. First, malicious actors break into a victim's network, surveil it, then run the malware manually. The attacks are tailored to cause maximum damage and the threat actors usually demand amounts in the tens of thousands of dollars.\\\nIn a typical attack on one large healthcare organization in 2018, the company ended up paying a ransom of four Bitcoins, then worth $56,707. Reports showed that access to the company's files was restored within two hours of paying the sum.\\\nAccording to Sophos, SamSam previously leveraged  RDP to gain access to targeted networks via brute force. SamSam is not spread automatically, like other malware. It requires skill because it forces the attacker to adapt their tactics to the individual environment. Next, the actors escalate their privileges to admin level. They scan the networks for worthy targets, using conventional tools, such as PsExec or PaExec, to deploy/execute, quickly encrypting files.\\\nThis Analytic Story includes searches designed to help detect and investigate signs of the SamSam ransomware, such as the creation of fileswrites to system32, writes with tell-tale extensions, batch files written to system32, and evidence of brute-force attacks via RDP.", "references": ["https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/an-in-depth-analysis-of-samsam-ransomware-and-boss-spider/", "https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/07/31/samsam-the-almost-6-million-ransomware/", "https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/samsam-ransomware-attacks.html"], "tags": {"analytic_story": "SamSam Ransomware", "category": ["Malware"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_id": ["T1490", "T1021.001", "T1082", "T1036", "T1003", "T1204.002", "T1204", "T1021", "T1036.005", "T1486", "T1021.002", "T1569", "T1485", "T1569.002", "T1595"], "mitre_attack_technique": ["User Execution", "Masquerading", "Malicious File", "Data Destruction", "SMB/Windows Admin Shares", "Remote Desktop Protocol", "System Services", "Service Execution", "OS Credential Dumping", "Match Legitimate Name or Location", "Data Encrypted for Impact", "Inhibit System Recovery", "Remote Services", "System Information Discovery"], "mitre_attack_tactics": ["Lateral Movement", "Defense Evasion", "Impact", "Credential Access", "Execution", "Discovery"], "mitre_attack_groups": ["Ke3chang", "APT41", "APT33", "Gallmaker", "TA459", "APT38", "APT12", "APT29", "Gorgon Group", "Magic Hound", "Turla", "Suckfly", "admin@338", "BlackTech", "APT19", "Elderwood", "Leviathan", "APT37", "Stolen Pencil", "Sandworm Team", "MuddyWater", "APT-C-36", "Sowbug", "FIN8", "Naikon", "APT1", "APT3", "Gamaredon Group", "Darkhotel", "Dragonfly 2.0", "Mofang", "Lazarus Group", "Rocke", "APT32", "FIN6", "The White Company", "menuPass", "Carbanak", "Inception", "Wizard Spider", "Deep Panda", "Axiom", "Tropic Trooper", "TEMP.Veles", "RTM", "Machete", "Frankenstein", "Honeybee", "Kimsuky", "Silence", "Cobalt Group", "BRONZE BUTLER", "Patchwork", "DarkHydrus", "FIN7", "APT18", "APT39", "no", "TA505", "FIN4", "Dark Caracal", "Blue Mockingbird", "Sharpshooter", "Rancor", "FIN10", "APT28", "Molerats", "PLATINUM", "Poseidon Group", "Windshift", "Orangeworm", "OilRig", "Threat Group-1314", "Stealth Falcon", "Whitefly"]}, "type": "", "detections": [{"name": "Detect malicious requests to exploit JBoss servers", "id": "c8bff7a4-11ea-4416-a27d-c5bca472913d", "version": 1, "date": "2017-09-23", "author": "Bhavin Patel, Splunk", "type": "TTP", "datamodel": ["Web"], "description": "This search is used to detect malicious HTTP requests crafted to exploit jmx-console in JBoss servers.

Attackers will often spend quite a bit of time and effort moving laterally. Because lateral movement renders an attacker the most vulnerable to detection, it's an excellent focus for detection and investigation.\\\nIndications of lateral movement can include the abuse of system utilities (such as `psexec.exe`), unauthorized use of remote desktop services, `file/admin$` shares, WMI, PowerShell, pass-the-hash, or the abuse of scheduled tasks. Organizations must be extra vigilant in detecting lateral movement techniques and look for suspicious activity in and around high-value strategic network assets, such as Active Directory, which are often considered the primary target or \"crown jewels\" to a persistent threat actor.\\\nAn adversary can use lateral movement for multiple purposes, including remote execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, obtaining access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, exfiltrating data, or delivering a secondary effect. Adversaries may use legitimate credentials alongside inherent network and operating-system functionality to remotely connect to other systems and remain under the radar of network defenders.\\\nIf there is evidence of lateral movement, it is imperative for analysts to collect evidence of the associated offending hosts. For example, an attacker might leverage host A to gain access to host B. From there, the attacker may try to move laterally to host C. In this example, the analyst should gather as much information as possible from all three hosts. \\\n It is also important to collect authentication logs for each host, to ensure that the offending accounts are well-documented.

Its complexity was designed into the process to ensure that the number of blocks mined each day would remain steady. So, it's par for the course that ambitious, but unscrupulous, miners make amassing the computing power of large enterprises--a practice known as cryptojacking--a top priority. \\\nCryptojacking has attracted an increasing amount of media attention since its explosion in popularity in the fall of 2017. The attacks have moved from in-browser exploits and mobile phones to enterprise cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Azure. It's difficult to determine exactly how widespread the practice has become, since bad actors continually evolve their ability to escape detection, including employing unlisted endpoints, moderating their CPU usage, and hiding the mining pool's IP address behind a free CDN. \\\nWhen malicious miners appropriate a cloud instance, often spinning up hundreds of new instances, the costs can become astronomical for the account holder. So it is critically important to monitor your systems for suspicious activities that could indicate that your network has been infiltrated. \\\nThis Analytic Story is focused on detecting suspicious new instances in your cloud environment to help prevent cryptominers from gaining a foothold. It contains detection searches that will detect when a previously unused instance type or AMI is used.

These servers establish a command and control channel that is used to proxy data between the compromised endpoint and the attacker. These channels relay commands from the attacker to the compromised endpoint and the output of those commands back to the attacker.\\\nBecause this communication is so critical for an adversary, they often use techniques designed to hide the true nature of the communications. There are many different techniques used to establish and communicate over these channels. This Analytic Story provides searches that look for a variety of the techniques used for these channels, as well as indications that these channels are active, by examining logs associated with border control devices and network-access control lists.", "references": ["https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Command_and_Control", "https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Command-and-control-servers-The-puppet-masters-that-govern-malware"], "tags": {"analytic_story": "Command and Control", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Security Monitoring", "mitre_attack_id": ["T1048", "T1071", "T1189", "T1095", "T1071.004", "T1048.003", "T1071.001"], "mitre_attack_technique": ["Non-Application Layer Protocol", "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol", "Web Protocols", "Drive-by Compromise", "Application Layer Protocol", "DNS", "Exfiltration Over Unencrypted/Obfuscated Non-C2 Protocol"], "mitre_attack_tactics": ["Command And Control", "Exfiltration", "Initial Access"], "mitre_attack_groups": ["Ke3chang", "APT41", "APT33", "APT38", "APT29", "Magic Hound", "Turla", "Thrip", "APT19", "Leafminer", "Elderwood", "APT37", "Sandworm Team", "Threat Group-3390", "MuddyWater", "FIN8", "APT3", "Gamaredon Group", "Darkhotel", "Dragonfly 2.0", "Lazarus Group", "Rocke", "APT32", "Inception", "Wizard Spider", "Tropic Trooper", "RTM", "Machete", "Cobalt Group", "BRONZE BUTLER", "WIRTE", "Patchwork", "FIN7", "APT18", "APT39", "SilverTerrier", "no", "TA505", "FIN4", "Dark Caracal", "Rancor", "APT28", "PLATINUM", "Windshift", "Orangeworm", "OilRig", "Stealth Falcon", "Night Dragon"]}, "type": "", "detections": [{"name": "DNS Query Length Outliers - MLTK", "id": "85fbcfe8-9718-4911-adf6-7000d077a3a9", "version": 2, "date": "2020-01-22", "author": "Rico Valdez, Splunk", "type": "Anomaly", "datamodel": ["Network_Resolution"], "description": "This search allows you to identify DNS requests that are unusually large for the record type being requested in your environment.", "search": "| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as start_time max(_time) as end_time values(DNS.src) as src values(DNS.dest) as dest from datamodel=Network_Resolution by DNS.query DNS.record_type | search DNS.record_type=* |  `drop_dm_object_name(DNS)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | eval query_length = len(query) | apply dns_query_pdfmodel threshold=0.01 | rename \"IsOutlier(query_length)\" as isOutlier | search isOutlier > 0 | sort -query_length | table start_time end_time query record_type count src dest query_length | `dns_query_length_outliers___mltk_filter` ", "how_to_implement": "To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model.

Many additional variables are provided for in memory operation of the beacon implant. On the network, depending on the malleable C2 profile used, it is near infinite in the amount of ways to conceal the C2 traffic with Cobalt Strike. Not every query may be specific to Cobalt Strike the tool, but the methodologies and techniques used by it.\\\nSplunk Threat Research reviewed all publicly available instances of Malleabe C2 Profiles and generated a list of the most commonly used spawnto and pipenames.\\\n`Spawnto_x86` and `spawnto_x64` is the process that Cobalt Strike will spawn and injects shellcode into.\\\nPipename sets the named pipe name used in Cobalt Strikes Beacon SMB C2 traffic.\\\nWith that, new detections were generated focused on these spawnto processes spawning without command line arguments. Similar, the named pipes most commonly used by Cobalt Strike added as a detection. In generating content for Cobalt Strike, the following is considered:\\\n- Is it normal for spawnto_ value to have no command line arguments? No command line arguments and a network connection?\\\n- What is the default, or normal, process lineage for spawnto_ value?\\\n- Does the spawnto_ value make network connections?\\\n- Is it normal for spawnto_ value to load jscript, vbscript, Amsi.dll, and clr.dll?\\\nWhile investigating a detection related to this Analytic Story, keep in mind the parent process, process path, and any file modifications that may occur.

It has been proven to work very well for its intended function. However if DNS is misconfigured, servers can be abused by attackers to levy amplification or redirection attacks against victims. Because DNS responses to `ANY` queries are so much larger than the queries themselves--and can be made with a UDP packet, which does not require a handshake--attackers can spoof the source address of the packet and cause much more data to be sent to the victim than if they sent the traffic themselves. The `ANY` requests are will be larger than normal DNS server requests, due to the fact that the server provides significant details, such as MX records and associated IP addresses. A large volume of this traffic can result in a DOS on the victim's machine. This misconfiguration leads to two possible victims, the first being the DNS servers participating in an attack and the other being the hosts that are the targets of the DOS attack.\\\nThe search in this story can help you to detect if attackers are abusing your company's DNS infrastructure to launch DNS amplification attacks causing Denial of Service to other victims.", "references": ["https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A", "https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/dns-amplification/"], "tags": {"analytic_story": "DNS Amplification Attacks", "category": ["Abuse"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Security Monitoring", "mitre_attack_id": ["T1498", "T1498.002"], "mitre_attack_technique": ["Network Denial of Service", "Reflection Amplification"], "mitre_attack_tactics": ["Impact"], "mitre_attack_groups": ["no"]}, "type": "", "detections": [{"name": "Large Volume of DNS ANY Queries", "id": "8fa891f7-a533-4b3c-af85-5aa2e7c1f1eb", "version": 1, "date": "2017-09-20", "author": "Bhavin Patel, Splunk", "type": "Anomaly", "datamodel": ["Network_Resolution"], "description": "The search is used to identify attempts to use your DNS Infrastructure for DDoS purposes via a DNS amplification attack leveraging ANY queries.", "search": "| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Resolution where nodename=DNS \"DNS.message_type\"=\"QUERY\" \"DNS.record_type\"=\"ANY\" by \"DNS.dest\" | `drop_dm_object_name(\"DNS\")` | where count>200 | `large_volume_of_dns_any_queries_filter`", "how_to_implement": "To successfully implement this search you must ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model.", "known_false_positives": "Legitimate ANY requests may trigger this search, however it is unusual to see a large volume of them under typical circumstances.

Unlike a Brute Force attack that targets a specific user or small group of users with a large number of passwords, password spraying follows the opposite aproach and increases the chances of obtaining valid credentials while avoiding account lockouts. This allows adversaries to remain undetected if the target organization does not have the proper monitoring and detection controls in place.\\\nPassword Spraying can be leveraged by adversaries across different stages in an attack. It can be used to obtain an iniial access to an environment but can also be used to escalate privileges when access has been already achieved. In some scenarios, this technique capitalizes on a security policy most organizations implement, password rotation. As enterprise users change their passwords, it is possible some pick predictable, seasonal passwords such as `$CompanyNameWinter`, `Summer2021`, etc.\\\nSpecifically, this Analytic Story is focused on detecting possible Password Spraying attacks against Active Directory environments leveraging Windows Event Logs in the `Account Logon` and `Logon/Logoff` Advanced Audit Policy categories. It presents 9 detection analytics which can aid defenders in identifyng instances where one source user, source host or source process attempts to authenticate against a target or targets using a high, unsual, number of unique users. A user, host or process attempting to authenticate with multiple users is not common behavior for legitimate systems and should be monitored by security teams.

In fact, research shows that as many as [91% of all successful attacks](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/91-percent-cyber-attacks-start-phishing-email-heres-how-protect-against-phishing) are initiated via a phishing email. \\\nAs most people know, these emails use fraudulent domains, [email scraping](https://www.cyberscoop.com/emotet-trojan-phishing-scraping-templates-cofense-geodo/), familiar contact names inserted as senders, and other tactics to lure targets into clicking a malicious link, opening an attachment with a [nefarious payload](https://www.cyberscoop.com/emotet-trojan-phishing-scraping-templates-cofense-geodo/), or entering sensitive personal information that perpetrators may intercept. This attack technique requires a relatively low level of skill and allows adversaries to easily cast a wide net. Worse, because its success relies on the gullibility of humans, it's impossible to completely \"automate\" it out of your environment. However, you can use ES and ESCU to detect and investigate potentially malicious payloads injected into your environment subsequent to a phishing attack. \\\nWhile any kind of file may contain a malicious payload, some are more likely to be perceived as benign (and thus more often escape notice) by the average victim&#151;especially when the attacker sends an email that seems to be from one of their contacts. An example is Microsoft Office files. Most corporate users are familiar with documents with the following suffixes: .doc/.docx (MS Word), .xls/.xlsx (MS Excel), and .ppt/.pptx (MS PowerPoint), so they may click without a second thought, slashing a hole in their organizations' security. \\\nFollowing is a typical series of events, according to an [article by Trend Micro](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/rising-trend-attackers-using-lnk-files-download-malware/):\\\n1. Attacker sends a phishing email. Recipient downloads the attached file, which is typically a .docx or .zip file with an embedded .lnk file\\\n1. The .lnk file executes a PowerShell script\\\n1. Powershell executes a reverse shell, rendering the exploit successful </ol>As a side note, adversaries are likely to use a tool like Empire to craft and obfuscate payloads and their post-injection activities, such as [exfiltration, lateral movement, and persistence](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire).\\\nThis Analytic Story focuses on detecting signs that a malicious payload has been injected into your environment. For example, one search detects outlook.exe writing a .zip file.

Before writing the payload to disk, it inserts a randomly generated string into the middle of the decrypted payload in an attempt to evade hash-based detections.\\\nAwareness of the Orangeworm group first surfaced in January, 2015. It has conducted targeted attacks against related industries, as well, such as pharmaceuticals and healthcare IT solution providers.\\\nHealthcare may be a promising target, because it is notoriously behind in technology, often using older operating systems and neglecting to patch computers. Even so, the group was able to evade detection for a full three years.

These searches help detect evidence of these attacks, such as network connections to external resources or web services spawning atypical child processes, among others.", "narrative": "This Analytic Story looks for probing and exploitation attempts targeting JBoss application servers. While the vulnerabilities associated with this story are rather dated, they were leveraged in a spring 2016 campaign in connection with the Samsam ransomware variant. Incidents involving this ransomware are unique, in that they begin with attacks against vulnerable services, rather than the phishing or drive-by attacks more common with ransomware. In this case, vulnerable JBoss applications appear to be the target of choice.\\\nIt is helpful to understand how often a notable event generated by this story occurs, as well as the commonalities between some of these events, both of which may provide clues about whether this is a common occurrence of minimal concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation. It may also help to understand whether the issue is restricted to a single user/system or whether it is broader in scope.\\\nWhen looking at the target of the behavior uncovered by the event, you should note the sensitivity of the user and or/system to help determine the potential impact. It is also helpful to identify other recent events involving the target. This can help tie different events together and give further situational awareness regarding the target host.\\\nVarious types of information for external systems should be reviewed and, potentially, collected if the incident is, indeed, judged to be malicious. This data may be useful for generating your own threat intelligence, so you can create future alerts.\\\nThe following factors may assist you in determining whether the event is malicious: \\\n1. Country of origin\\\n1. Responsible party\\\n1. Fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address\\\n1. Registration of fully qualified domain names associated with external IP address Determining whether it is a dynamic domain frequently visited by others and/or how third parties categorize it can also help you qualify and understand the event and possible motivation for the attack. In addition, there are various sources that may provide reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist you in determining whether the event is malicious in nature. Finally, determining whether there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect data points or expose other historic events that might be brought back into scope.\\\nGathering various data on the system of interest can sometimes help quickly determine whether something suspicious is happening. Some of these items include determining who else may have logged into the system recently, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and/or whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted.\\\nhen a specific service or application is targeted, it is often helpful to know the associated version, to help determine whether it is vulnerable to a specific exploit.\\\nIf you suspect an attack targeting a web server, it is helpful to look at some of the behavior of the web service to see if there is evidence that the service has been compromised. Some indications of this might be network connections to external resources, the web service spawning child processes that are not associated with typical behavior, and whether the service wrote any files that might be malicious in nature.\\\nIf a suspicious file is found, we can review more information about it to help determine if it is, in fact, malicious. Identifying the file type, any processes that opened the file, the processes that may have created and/or modified the file, and how many other systems potentially have this file can you determine whether the file is malicious. Also, determining the file hash and checking it against reputation sources, such as VirusTotal, can sometimes help you quickly determine if it is malicious in nature.\\\nOften, a simple inspection of a suspect process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if svchost.exe is found running from a location other than `C:\\Windows\\System32`, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when simply reviewing process names. \\\nIt can also be helpful to examine various behaviors of and the parent of the process of interest. For example, if it turns out the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see whether the parent process spawned other processes that might also warrant further scrutiny.

As a result, the group's activity, which the US government refers to as \"Hidden Cobra,\" has surreptitiously crept onto the collective radar as a preeminent global threat.\\\nThese state-sponsored actors are thought to be responsible for everything from a hack on a South Korean nuclear plant to an attack on Sony in anticipation of its release of the movie \"The Interview\" at the end of 2014. They're also notorious for cyberespionage. In recent years, the group seems to be focused on financial crimes, such as cryptojacking.\\\nIn June of 2018, The Department of Homeland Security, together with the FBI and other U.S. government partners, issued Technical Alert (TA-18-149A) to advise the public about two variants of North Korean malware. One variant, dubbed \"Joanap,\" is a multi-stage peer-to-peer botnet that allows North Korean state actors to exfiltrate data, download and execute secondary payloads, and initialize proxy communications. The other variant, \"Brambul,\" is a Windows32 SMB worm that is dropped into a victim network. When executed, the malware attempts to spread laterally within a victim's local subnet, connecting via the SMB protocol and initiating brute-force password attacks.

About two months later, hackers exploited the flaw to carry out the world's <a href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/09/07/nations-biggest-hacks-and-data-breaches-millions/644311001/> 5th largest data breach</a>. The target, credit giant Equifax, <a href=https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/16/technology/equifax-breach-security-hole/index.html>told investigators</a> that it had become aware of the vulnerability two months before the attack. \\\nThe exploit involved manipulating the `Content-Type HTTP` header to execute commands embedded in the header.\\\nThis Analytic Story contains two different searches that help to identify activity that may be related to this issue. The first search looks for characteristics of the `Content-Type` header consistent with attempts to exploit the vulnerability. This should be a relatively pertinent indicator, as the `Content-Type` header is generally consistent and does not have a large degree of variation.\\\nThe second search looks for the execution of various commands typically entered on the command shell when an attacker first lands on a system. These commands are not generally executed on web servers during the course of day-to-day operation, but they may be used when the system is undergoing maintenance or troubleshooting.\\\nFirst, it is helpful is to understand how often the notable event is generated, as well as the commonalities in some of these events. This may help determine whether this is a common occurrence that is of a lesser concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation. It can also help to understand whether the issue is restricted to a single user or system or is broader in scope.\\\nWhen looking at the target of the behavior illustrated by the event, you should note the sensitivity of the user and or/system to help determine the potential impact. It is also helpful to see what other events involving the target have occurred in the recent past. This can help tie different events together and give further situational awareness regarding the target.\\\nVarious types of information for external systems should be reviewed and (potentially) collected if the incident is, indeed, judged to be malicious. Information like this can be useful in generating your own threat intelligence to create alerts in the future.\\\nLooking at the country, responsible party, and fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address--as well as the registration information associated with those domain names, if they are frequently visited by others--can help you answer the question of \"who,\" in regard to the external system. Answering that can help qualify the event and may serve useful for tracking. In addition, there are various sources that can provide some reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist in determining if the event is malicious in nature. Finally, determining whether or not there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect some dots or show other events that should be brought into scope.\\\nGathering various data elements on the system of interest can sometimes help quickly determine that something suspicious may be happening. Some of these items include determining who else may have recently logged into the system, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted.\\\nhen a specific service or application is targeted, it is often helpful to know the associated version to help determine whether or not it is vulnerable to a specific exploit.\\\nhen it is suspected there is an attack targeting a web server, it is helpful to look at some of the behavior of the web service to see if there is evidence that the service has been compromised. Some indications of this might be network connections to external resources, the web service spawning child processes that are not associated with typical behavior, and whether the service wrote any files that might be malicious in nature.\\\nIn the event that a suspicious file is found, we can review more information about it to help determine if it is, in fact, malicious. Identifying the file type, any processes that have the file open, what processes created and/or modified the file, and the number of systems that may have this file can help to determine if the file is malicious. Also, determining the file hash and checking it against reputation sources, such as VirusTotal, can sometimes quickly help determine whether it is malicious in nature.\\\nOften, a simple inspection of a suspect process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if `svchost.exe` is found running from a location other than `C:\\Windows\\System32`, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when simply reviewing process names. Similarly, if the process itself seems legitimate, but the parent process is running from the temporary browser cache, there may be activity initiated via a compromised website the user visited.\\\nIt can also be very helpful to examine various behaviors of the process of interest or the parent of the process that is of interest. For example, if it turns out that the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see if the parent to that process spawned other processes that might also be worth further scrutiny. If a process is suspect, reviewing the network connections made around the time of the event and/or if the process spawned any child processes could be helpful in determining whether it is malicious or executing a malicious script.", "references": ["https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/v3.2/dev/rules/REQUEST-944-APPLICATION-ATTACK-JAVA.conf"], "tags": {"analytic_story": "Apache Struts Vulnerability", "category": ["Vulnerability"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_id": ["T1082"], "mitre_attack_technique": ["System Information Discovery"], "mitre_attack_tactics": ["Discovery"], "mitre_attack_groups": ["Ke3chang", "Magic Hound", "Turla", "admin@338", "APT19", "APT37", "Sandworm Team", "MuddyWater", "Sowbug", "APT3", "Gamaredon Group", "Darkhotel", "Lazarus Group", "Rocke", "APT32", "Inception", "Tropic Trooper", "Frankenstein", "Honeybee", "Kimsuky", "Patchwork", "APT18", "Blue Mockingbird", "OilRig", "Stealth Falcon"]}, "type": "", "detections": [{"name": "Unusually Long Content-Type Length", "id": "57a0a2bf-353f-40c1-84dc-29293f3c35b7", "version": 1, "date": "2017-10-13", "author": "Bhavin Patel, Splunk", "type": "Anomaly", "datamodel": [], "description": "This search looks for unusually long strings in the Content-Type http header that the client sends the server.", "search": "`stream_http` | eval cs_content_type_length = len(cs_content_type) | where cs_content_type_length > 100 | table endtime src_ip dest_ip cs_content_type_length cs_content_type url | `unusually_long_content_type_length_filter`", "how_to_implement": "This particular search leverages data extracted from Stream:HTTP.

One reason is its distributed nature. It relies on unstructured connections between millions of clients and servers over inherently insecure protocols.\\\nThe gravity and extent of the importance of securing DNS from attacks is undeniable. The fallout of compromised DNS can be disastrous. Not only can hackers bring down an entire business, they can intercept confidential information, emails, and login credentials, as well. \\\nOn January 22, 2019, the US Department of Homeland Security 2019's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) raised awareness of some high-profile DNS hijacking attacks against infrastructure, both in the United States and abroad. It issued Emergency Directive 19-01 (see https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/19-01/), which summarized the activity and required government agencies to take the following four actions, all within 10 days: \\\n1. For all .gov or other agency-managed domains, audit public DNS records on all authoritative and secondary DNS servers, verify that they resolve to the intended location or report them to CISA.\\\n1. Update the passwords for all accounts on systems that can make changes to each agency 2019's DNS records.\\\n1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts on systems that can make changes to each agency's 2019 DNS records or, if impossible, provide CISA with the names of systems, the reasons why MFA cannot be enabled within the required timeline, and an ETA for when it can be enabled.\\\n1. CISA will begin regular delivery of newly added certificates to Certificate Transparency (CT) logs for agency domains via the Cyber Hygiene service. Upon receipt, agencies must immediately begin monitoring CT log data for certificates issued that they did not request. If an agency confirms that a certificate was unauthorized, it must report the certificate to the issuing certificate authority and to CISA. Of course, it makes sense to put equivalent actions in place within your environment, as well. \\\nIn DNS hijacking, the attacker assumes control over an account or makes use of a DNS service exploit to make changes to DNS records. Once they gain access, attackers can substitute their own MX records, name-server records, and addresses, redirecting emails and traffic through their infrastructure, where they can read, copy, or modify information seen. They can also generate valid encryption certificates to help them avoid browser-certificate checks.

While that point is debatable, it is true that attacks against MacOS systems are much less common. However, this fact does not mean that Macs are impervious to breaches.

According to AV-test, in 2018, there were 86,865 new MacOS malware variants, up from 27,338 the year before&#151;a 31% increase. In contrast, the independent research firm found that new Windows malware had increased from 65.17M to 76.86M during that same period, less than half the rate of growth. The bottom line is that while the numbers look a lot smaller than Windows, it's definitely time to take Mac security more seriously.\\\nThis Analytic Story addresses the ColdRoot remote access trojan (RAT), which was uploaded to Github in 2016, but was still escaping detection by the first quarter of 2018, when a new, more feature-rich variant was discovered masquerading as an Apple audio driver. Among other capabilities, the Pascal-based ColdRoot can heist passwords from users' keychains and remotely control infected machines without detection. In the initial report of his findings, Patrick Wardle, Chief Research Officer for Digita Security, explained that the new ColdRoot RAT could start and kill processes on the breached system, spawn new remote-desktop sessions, take screen captures and assemble them into a live stream of the victim's desktop, and more.\\\nSearches in this Analytic Story leverage the capabilities of OSquery to address ColdRoot detection from several different angles, such as looking for the existence of associated files and processes, and monitoring for signs of an installed keylogger.", "references": ["https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/osxcoldroot-and-the-rat-invasion/", "https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x2A.html", "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coldroot-rat-still-undetectable-despite-being-uploaded-on-github-two-years-ago/"], "tags": {"analytic_story": "ColdRoot MacOS RAT", "category": ["Malware"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_id": [], "mitre_attack_technique": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "mitre_attack_groups": []}, "type": "", "detections": [{"name": "Processes Tapping Keyboard Events", "id": "2a371608-331d-4034-ae2c-21dda8f1d0ec", "version": 1, "date": "2019-01-25", "author": "Jose Hernandez, Splunk", "type": "TTP", "datamodel": [], "description": "This search looks for processes in an MacOS system that is tapping keyboard events in MacOS, and essentially monitoring all keystrokes made by a user.
