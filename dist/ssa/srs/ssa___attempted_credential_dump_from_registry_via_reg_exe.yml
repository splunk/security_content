status: production
description: The following analytic identifies the use of `reg.exe` attempting to
  export Windows registry keys that contain hashed credentials. Adversaries will utilize
  this technique to capture and perform offline password cracking.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
