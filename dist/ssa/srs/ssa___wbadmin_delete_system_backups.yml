  Tool) that delete backup files. This is typically used by ransomware to prevent
  recovery.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint_Processess` datamodel.
