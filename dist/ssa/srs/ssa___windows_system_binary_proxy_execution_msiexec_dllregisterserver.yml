description: The following analytic identifies the usage of msiexec.exe using the
  /y switch parameter, which grants the ability for msiexec to load DLLRegisterServer.
  Upon triage, review parent process and capture any artifacts for further review.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: This analytic will need to be tuned for your environment based
  on legitimate usage of msiexec.exe. Filter as needed.
