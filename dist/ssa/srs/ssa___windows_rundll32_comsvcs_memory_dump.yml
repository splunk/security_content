description: The following analytic identifies memory dumping using comsvcs.dll with
  the minidump function with `rundll32.exe`. This technique is common with adversaries
  who would like to dump the memory of lsass.exe.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including Windows command line logging. You can see how we test this with [Event
  Code 4688](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4688a)
  on the [attack_range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range/blob/develop/ansible/roles/windows_common/tasks/windows-enable-4688-cmd-line-audit.yml).
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, filter as needed.
