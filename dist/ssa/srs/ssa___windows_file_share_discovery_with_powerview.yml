version: 1
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies the use of the Invoke-ShareFinder PowerShell
  commandlet part of PowerView. This module obtains the list of all active domain
  computers and lists the active shares on each computer. Network file shares in Active
  Directory environments may contain sensitive information like backups, scripts,
  credentials, etc. Adversaries who have obtained a foothold in an AD network may
  leverage PowerView to identify secrets and leverage them for Privilege Escalation
  or Lateral Movement.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
