description: this search is to detect execution of `cipher.exe` to clear the unallocated
  sectors of a specific disk. This technique was seen in some ransomware to make it
  impossible to forensically recover deleted files.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
