name: Windows COM Hijacking InprocServer32 Modification

version: 1
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies the use of reg.exe performing an add
  to the InProcServer32, which may be related to COM hijacking. Adversaries can use
  the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate
  software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.
  Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference
  to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when
  executed. When that system component is executed through normal system operation
  the adversary's code will be executed instead.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and some filtering may be required.
