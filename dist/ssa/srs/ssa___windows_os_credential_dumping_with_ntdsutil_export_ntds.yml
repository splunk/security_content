description: 'Monitor for signs that Ntdsutil is being used to Extract Active Directory
  database - NTDS.dit, typically used for offline password cracking. It may be used
  in normal circumstances with no command line arguments or shorthand variations of
  more common arguments. Ntdsutil.exe is typically seen run on a Windows Server. Typical
  command used to dump ntds.dit

  ntdsutil "ac i ntds" "ifm" "create full C:\Temp" q q

  This technique uses "Install from Media" (IFM), which will extract a copy of the
  Active Directory database. A successful export of the Active Directory database
  will yield a file modification named ntds.dit to the destination.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Highly possible Server Administrators will troubleshoot with
  ntdsutil.exe, generating false positives.
