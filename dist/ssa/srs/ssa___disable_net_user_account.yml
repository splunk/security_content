description: This analytic will identify a suspicious command-line that disables a
  user account using the native `net.exe` or `net1.exe` utility to Windows. This technique
  may used by the adversaries to interrupt availability of accounts and continue the
  impact against the organization.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe/net1.exe may be
  used.
known_false_positives: System administrators or automated scripts may disable an account
  but not a common practice. Filter as needed.
