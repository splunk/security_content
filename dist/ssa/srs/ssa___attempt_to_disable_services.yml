description: The following analytic identifies Windows Service Control, `sc.exe`,
  attempting to disable a service. This is typically identified in parallel with other
  instances of service enumeration of attempts to stop a service and then disable
  it. Adversaries utilize this technique to terminate security services or other related
  services to continue there objective and evade detections.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: It is possible administrative scripts may start/stop/delete
  services. Filter as needed.
