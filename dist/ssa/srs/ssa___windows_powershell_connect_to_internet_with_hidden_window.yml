detection_type: STREAMING
description: The following hunting analytic identifies PowerShell commands utilizing
  the WindowStyle parameter to hide the window on the compromised endpoint. This combination
  of command-line options is suspicious because it is overriding the default PowerShell
  execution policy, attempts to hide its activity from the user, and connects to the
  Internet. Removed in this version of the query is New-Object. The analytic identifies
  all variations of WindowStyle, as PowerShell allows the ability to shorten the parameter.
  For example w, win, windowsty and so forth. In addition, through our research it
  was identified that PowerShell will interpret different command switch types beyond
  the hyphen. We have added endash, emdash, horizontal bar, and forward slash.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
known_false_positives: Legitimate process can have this combination of command-line
  options, but it's not common.
