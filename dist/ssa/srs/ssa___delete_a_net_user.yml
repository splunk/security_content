description: This analytic will detect a suspicious net.exe/net1.exe command-line
  to delete a user on a system. This technique may be use by an administrator for
  legitimate purposes, however this behavior has been used in the wild to impair some
  user or deleting adversaries tracks created during its lateral movement additional
  systems. During triage, review parallel processes for additional behavior. Identify
  any other user accounts created before or after.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe may be used.

known_false_positives: System administrators or scripts may delete user accounts via
  this technique. Filter as needed.
