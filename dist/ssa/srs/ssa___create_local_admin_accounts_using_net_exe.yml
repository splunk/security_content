description: The following analytic detects the creation of local administrator accounts
  using the net.exe command to mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access
  and prevent further damage to the environment by responding to potential threats
  earlier and taking appropriate actions to protect the organization's systems and
  data. This detection is made by a Splunk query to search for processes with the
  name net.exe or net1.exe that include the "/add" parameter and have specific keywords
  related to administrator accounts in their process name. This detection is important
  because the creation of unauthorized local administrator accounts might indicate
  that an attacker has successfully created a new administrator account and is trying
  to gain persistent access to a system or escalate their privileges for data theft,
  or other malicious activities. False positives might occur since there might be
  legitimate uses of the net.exe command and the creation of administrator accounts
  in certain circumstances. You must consider the context of the activity and other
  indicators of compromise before taking any action. For next steps, review the details
  of the identified process, including the user, parent process, and parent process
  name. Examine any relevant on-disk artifacts and look for concurrent processes to
  determine the source of the attack.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: System administrators or scripts may add user accounts via
  this technique. Filter as needed.
