description: The following analytic identifies Appvlp.exe which is a native living
  off the land binary or script (LOLBAS) within the Windows operating system that
  may be abused by adversaries by moving it to a new directory. The list of binaries
  was derived from the https://lolbas-project.github.io site.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting logs
  with the process name, command-line arguments, and parent processes from your endpoints.
  Collect endpoint data such as Sysmon or Windows Events 4688.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may be required.
  Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application
  in use.
