description: The following analytic identifies child processes spawning from  "mshta.exe".
  The search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments
  were used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, parent process
  "mshta.exe" and its child process.
search: '| from read_ssa_enriched_events() | eval timestamp=parse_long(ucast(map_get(input_event,
  "_time"), "string", null)), cmd_line=lower(ucast(map_get(input_event, "process"),
  "string", null)), process_name=lower(ucast(map_get(input_event, "process_name"),
  "string", null)), process_path=ucast(map_get(input_event, "process_path"), "string",
  null), parent_process_name=ucast(map_get(input_event, "parent_process_name"), "string",

  cmd_line IS NOT NULL AND process_name IS NOT NULL AND parent_process_name IS NOT

  "string", null)), body=create_map(["event_id", event_id, "cmd_line", cmd_line, "process_name",
  process_name, "parent_process_name", parent_process_name, "process_path", process_path])

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
