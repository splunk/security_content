name: Modify ACLs Permission Of Files Or Folders
id: 9ae9a48a-cdbe-11eb-875a-acde48001122
version: 3
description: This analytic identifies suspicious modification of ACL permission to
  a files or folder to make it available to everyone or to a specific user. This technique
  may be used by the adversary to evade ACLs or protected files access. This changes
  is commonly configured by the file or directory owner with appropriate permission.
  This behavior raises suspicion if this command is seen on an endpoint utilized by
  an account with no permission to do so.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed cacls.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: System administrators may use this windows utility. filter
  is needed.
