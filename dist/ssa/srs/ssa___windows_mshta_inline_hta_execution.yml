description: The following analytic identifies "mshta.exe" execution with inline protocol
  handlers. "JavaScript", "VBScript", and "About" are the only supported options when
  invoking HTA content directly on the command-line. The search will return the first
  time and last time these command-line arguments were used for these executions,
  as well as the target system, the user, process "mshta.exe" and its parent process.
search: '| from read_ssa_enriched_events() | eval timestamp=parse_long(ucast(map_get(input_event,
  "_time"), "string", null)), cmd_line=lower(ucast(map_get(input_event, "process"),
  "string", null)), process_name=lower(ucast(map_get(input_event, "process_name"),
  "string", null)), process_path=ucast(map_get(input_event, "process_path"), "string",
  null), parent_process_name=ucast(map_get(input_event, "parent_process_name"), "string",
  null), event_id=ucast(map_get(input_event, "event_id"), "string", null) | where
  cmd_line IS NOT NULL AND process_name IS NOT NULL | where process_name="mshta.exe"
  AND (like (cmd_line, "%vbscript%") OR like (cmd_line, "%javascript%") OR like (cmd_line,
  "%about%")) | eval start_time=timestamp, end_time=timestamp, entities=mvappend(ucast(map_get(input_event,
  "dest_user_id"), "string", null), ucast(map_get(input_event, "dest_device_id"),
  "string", null)), body=create_map(["event_id", event_id, "cmd_line", cmd_line, "process_name",
  process_name, "parent_process_name", parent_process_name, "process_path", process_path])
  | into write_ssa_detected_events();'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
