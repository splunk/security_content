description: This analytic will detect the execution of sdelete.exe attempting to
  delete potentially important files that may related to adversary or insider threats
  to destroy evidence or information sabotage. Sdelete is a SysInternals utility meant
  to securely delete files on disk. This tool is commonly used to clear tracks and
  artifact on the targeted host.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, filter as needed.
