description: The following analytic identifies the use of the findstr command employed
  to search for unsecured credentials Group Policy Preferences (GPP). GPP are tools
  that allow administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. These
  policies allow administrators to set local accounts. These group policies are stored
  in SYSVOL on a domain controller. This means that any domain user can view the SYSVOL
  share and decrypt the password (using the AES key that has been made public). While
  Microsoft released a patch that impedes Administrators to create unsecure credentials,
  existing Group Policy Preferences files with passwords are not removed from SYSVOL.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage findstr to find passwords in GPO
  to validate exposure. Filter as needed.
