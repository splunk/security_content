class GeneratingCommand(SearchCommand):
    """ Generates events based on command arguments.

    Generating commands receive no input and must be the first command on a pipeline. There are three pipelines:
    streams, events, and reports. The streams pipeline generates or processes time-ordered event records on an
    indexer or search head.

    Streaming commands filter, modify, or augment event records and can be applied to subsets of index data in a
    parallel manner. An example of a streaming command from Splunk's built-in command set is rex_ which extracts and
    adds fields to event records at search time. Records that pass through the streams pipeline move on to the events
    pipeline.

    The events pipeline generates or processes records on a search head. Eventing commands typically filter, group,
    order, or augment event records. Examples of eventing commands from Splunk's built-in command set include sort_,
    dedup_, and cluster_. Each execution of an eventing command should produce a set of event records that is
    independently usable by downstream processors. Records that pass through the events pipeline move on to the reports
    pipeline.

    The reports pipeline also runs on a search head, but yields data structures for presentation, not event records.
    Examples of streaming from Splunk's built-in command set include chart_, stats_, and contingency_.

    GeneratingCommand configuration
    ===============================

    Configure your generating command based on the pipeline that it targets. How you configure your command depends on
    the Search Command Protocol (SCP) version.

    +----------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
    | Pipeline | SCP 1                               | SCP 2                                      |
    +==========+=====================================+============================================+
    | streams  | streaming=True[,local=[True|False]] | type='streaming'[,distributed=[true|false] |
    +----------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
    | events   | retainsevents=True, streaming=False | type='events'                              |
    +----------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
    | reports  | streaming=False                     | type='reporting'                           |
    +----------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

    Only streaming commands may be distributed to indexers. By default generating commands are configured to run
    locally in the streams pipeline and will run under either SCP 1 or SCP 2.

    .. code-block:: python

        @Configuration()
        class StreamingGeneratingCommand(GeneratingCommand)
            ...

    How you configure your command to run on a different pipeline or in a distributed fashion depends on what SCP
    protocol versions you wish to support. You must be sure to configure your command consistently for each protocol,
    if you wish to support both protocol versions correctly.
