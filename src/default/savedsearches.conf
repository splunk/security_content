action.escu.eli5 = This search and its corresponding subsearch run through the following series of steps: \
\
1. Retrieve all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls specifically for creating/modifying/replacing network Access Control Lists (ACLs).\
\
1. Kick off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out the ARN into a more friendly format.\
\
1. Count the number of API calls per Amazon Resource Name (ARN).\
\
1. Load the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\
\
1. Drop the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merge the rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \
\
1. Rename `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\
\
1. Calculate the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting the past much more heavily than the current hour. They do the same for the standard deviation--weighting the past more heavily than the current.\
\
1. Update the cache file with the latest results.\
\
1. Set the minimum threshold for the number of data points and set the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\
\
1. Make a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\
\
1. Filter out anything that it determines is not a spike and return the list of ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of all the API calls, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for each of these ARNs. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine. The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best when you run the "Baseline of Network ACL Activity by ARN" support search once to create a lookup file of previously seen Network ACL Activity. To add or remove API event names related to network ACLs, edit the macro `NetworkACLEvents`.

action.escu.confidence = medium
action.escu.eli5 = This search and its corresponding subsearch run through the following series of steps: \
\
1. Retrieve all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls specifically for deletion of S3 buckets.\
\
1. Kick off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out and converts the ARN into a more friendly format.\
\
1. Count the number of API calls per ARN.\
\
1. Load the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\
\
1. Drop the count from the latest hour, since it is unnecessary, and merge the rest of the data with the results of the `stats` command. \
\
1. Rename `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\
\
1. Calculate the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting the past more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation&#151;weighting the past more heavily than the current.\
\
1. Update the cache file with the latest results.\
\
1. Set the minimum threshold for the number of data points and the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\
\
1. Make a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and if the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\
\
1. Filter out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of the deleted S3 buckets, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for each of these user ARNs.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine. The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike.

action.escu.eli5 = This search may look complex, but it's a neat representation of how statistics can help you understand your dataset to bubble up events that are not normal compared to its behavior. The search consists of three parts. The first part of the SPL fetches the data you want to work on. In this search, we calculate the sum of bytes sent and bytes_out from systems categorized as email_server to each host. We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host. Finally, it includes the number of standard deviations away the byte count was from these averages.
action.escu.how_to_implement = This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.

\
1. Retrieves all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls.\
\
1. Kicks off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out the ARN into a more friendly format.\
\
1. Counts the number of API calls per ARN.\
\
1. Loads the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\
\
1. Drops the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merges the rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \
\
1. Renames `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\
\
1. Calculates the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting the past much more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation--weighting the past more heavily than the current.\
\
1. Updates the cache file with the latest results.\
\
1. Sets the minimum threshold for the number of data points and sets the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\
\
1. Makes a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\
\
1. Filters out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of all the API calls, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for each of these ARNs. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.

This will cause the system to no longer trust the software signed with this certificate and disallow it from executing.

Since we want to detect a high number of instances terminated within a short period, we create event buckets for 10-minute windows. We then calculate the total number of instances terminated by a particular user, as well as the average- and standard-deviation values. Assign a `threshold_value` in the search. Try starting with 3 (but it will likely need to be tweaked for your environment). The `eval` function will set the outlier to 1 if the number of instances is greater than the average number of instances terminated, added to the multiplied value of threshold and standard deviation. We then filter out outliers with a value of 1 and show only those instance-termination events that happened within the previous 10 minutes.

Next, it recalculates the `firstTime` and `lastTime` field for each country, region, city, and IP address and outputs this data to the lookup file to update the local cache.

This search will need to be customized to fit your environment&#151;improving its fidelity by counting based on something much more specific, such as a device ID that may be present in your dataset. Consideration for whether the large number of registrations are occuring from a first-time seen domain may also be important.  Extending the search window to look further back in time, or even calculating the average per hour/day for each email domain to look for an anomalous spikes, will improve this search.  You can also use Shannon entropy or Levenshtein Distance (both courtesy of URL Toolbox) to consider the randomness or similarity of the email name or email domain, as the names are often machine-generated.

It appends the historical data to those results in the lookup file. Next, it recalculates the `firstTime` and `lastTime` field for each country, region, city, and IP address and outputs this data to the lookup file to update the local cache. It then calculates the `firstTime` and `lastTime` for each country. It returns only those events from countries that have first been seen in the past hour. This is combined with the main search to return the time, user, IP address, city, event name, and error code from the action.

 This search will fire any time a new country is seen in the **GeoIP** database for any kind of provisioning activity.

If you are located in countries where the free version of **MaxMind GeoIP** that ships by default with Splunk has weak resolution (particularly small countries in less economically powerful regions), this may be much less valuable to you.

action.escu.eli5 = This search retrieves all the VPC Flow log entries that have recorded a blocked outbound network connection originating from your AWS environment. Then it kicks off a subsearch, which looks at the same data and performs the following series of steps: \
\
1. Counts the number of blocked outbound connections by each source IP\
\
1. Loads the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the average blocked connections, and the standard deviation for each source IP.\
\
1. Drops the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merges the rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \
\
1. Renames `numberOfBlockedConnections` as `latestCount`.\
\
1. Calculates the new average value for each source IP with the latest count, weighting the past much more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation, weighting the past more heavily than the current.\
\
1. Updates the cache file with the latest results.\
\
1. Sets the minimum threshold for the number of data points and sets the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\
\
1. Makes a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\
\
1. Filters out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of source IPs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the list of all destination IPs for which the traffic was blocked, the network interface ID, the number of unique destination IP, and the total number of blocked connections for each of these source IP addresses. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your VPC Flow logs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the number of data points required to meet the definition of "spike." The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best when you run the "Baseline of Blocked Outbound Connection" support search once to create a history of previously seen blocked outbound connections.

\
1. Retrieves all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls specifically for security groups.\
\
1. Kicks off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out the ARN into a more friendly format.\
\
1. Counts the number of API calls per ARN.\
\
1. Loads the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\
\
1. Drops the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merges the rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \
\
1. Renames `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\
\
1. Calculates the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting the past much more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation--weighting the past more heavily than the current.\
\
1. Updates the cache file with the latest results.\
\
1. Sets the minimum threshold for the number of data points and sets the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\
\
1. Makes a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\
\
1. Filters out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of all the API calls, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for each of these ARNs. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.

action.escu.eli5 = This search may look complex, but it's a neat representation of how statistics can help you understand your dataset to bubble up events that are not normal compared to its behavior. The search consists of three parts. The first part of the SPL fetches the data you want to work on. In this search, we calculate the sum of bytes sent and bytes_out from systems categorized as email_server to each host. We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host. Finally, it includes the number of standard deviations away the byte count was from these averages.
action.escu.how_to_implement = This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.  Your email servers must be categorized as "email_server" for the search to work, as well. You may need to adjust the deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples values based on the network traffic in your environment. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.
