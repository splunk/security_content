workflow: This workbook provides the initial steps for atomic indicator enrichment.  There is no detonation process here because detonation should be either an internal or paid for service for customers.  Additionally, malware detonation can be a time consuming process (some implemementation put a timing delay on the processing). Not including this will ensure your playbooks are fast and that you can always call it as an additonal process with a separate playbook.
Indicator enrichment is a necessary first process regardless of the inital alarm. In developing our best practices, we see enrichment of atomic indicators is the first step and the easiest to start and build a foundation of automation and orchestration upon.
