name: NIST 800-61r2 Response Plan
id: b974f8bb-2999-4480-94ef-8a90029b8759
description: The NIST incident response process has several phases. This response plan describes the major phases of the incident response process "preparation", "detection and  analysis", "containment, eradication and recovery", and "post-incident" activityâ€”in detail. Customers should use this process to build effective incident response plans.  This particular response template aligns strictly on the four phases of the NIST framework described in NIST 800-61r2 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)

workflow: Organizations should use this response plan as template to define the processes for their security operations teams.
    With this as the template and then customizing the response plan around attack vectors. Organizations can fashion a framework for thier response procedures.
    Response plans and response procedures are different in the setting that procedures should have the actual step-by-step actions vs an response plan that discuses and deomonstrates actions without specifcs and aligns to the policy.
    > Preparation should not be imported into response tools that support ingestion (hive, phantom, xsoar, etc).
