### ESCU DETECTIONS ###


[ESCU - AWS Cloud Provisioning From Previously Unseen City - Rule]
action.escu = 0
action.escu.enabled = 1
description = This search looks for AWS provisioning activities from previously unseen cities.  Provisioning activities are defined broadly as any event that begins with "Run" or "Create." 
action.escu.mappings = {"cis20": ["CIS 1"], "nist": ["ID.AM"]}
action.escu.eli5 = The subsearch returns all events with event names that start with "Run" or "Create," and then does a `GeoIP` lookup on the IP address that initiated the action within the last hour. It appends the historical data to those results in the lookup file. Next, it recalculates the `firstTime` and `lastTime` field for each country, region, city, and IP address and outputs this data to the lookup file to update the local cache. It then calculates the `firstTime` and `lastTime` for each city. It returns only those events from cities that have first been seen in the past hour. This is combined with the main search to return the time, user, IP address, city, event name, and error code from the action.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen AWS Provisioning Activity Sources" support search once to create a history of previously seen locations that have provisioned AWS resources.
action.escu.known_false_positives = This is a strictly behavioral search, so we define "false positive" slightly differently. Every time this fires, it will accurately reflect the first occurrence in the time period you're searching within, plus what is stored in the cache feature. But while there are really no "false positives" in a traditional sense, there is definitely lots of noise.\
 This search will fire any time a new city is seen in the **GeoIP** database for any kind of provisioning activity. If you typically do all provisioning from tools inside of your city, there should be few false positives. If you are located in countries where the free version of **MaxMind GeoIP** that ships by default with Splunk has weak resolution (particularly small countries in less economically powerful regions), this may be much less valuable to you.

1. Retrieves the **AssumeRole** event\
1. Verifies that the log entry contains a value for the account ID of the requesting account\
1. Ensures that the requesting account ID does not match the account ID of the requested account\
1. Pulls in the previously seen requesting and requested account IDs\
1. Splits up and executes multiple search paths at the same.\
1. The first path determines the **firstTime** and **lastTime** entries for the cache file\
1. Outputs the data to the cache file.\
1. Creates a conditional statement that is always false (both because we don't want these values to exit the search pipeline and because we think we're clever).The second pipeline adds the **firstTime** and **lastTime** entries to search results. Next, it filters out any account pairs that haven't been seen for the first time within the last hour. The `isnotnull(_time)` will remove the entries from the cache file.\
The search finishes by gathering the data that it will display to the user.

action.escu.eli5 = Attackers often use random, long domain names for components of their attack infrastructure. This search leverages the probability distribution function algorithm provided by the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to identify outliers in the length of the DNS query for each record type observed. The companion search "Baseline of DNS Query Length - MLTK" creates a machine-learning (ML) model built over the historical data used by this search. The determination of what is considered an outlier may be adjusted via the threshold parameter in the search. More information on the algorithm used can be found at `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/4.2.0/User/Algorithms#DensityFunction`.
action.escu.how_to_implement = To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. In addition, the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version 4.2 or greater must be installed on your search heads, along with any required dependencies. Finally, the support search "Baseline of DNS Query Length - MLTK" must be executed before this detection search, because it builds a machine-learning (ML) model over the historical data used by this search. It is important that this search is run in the same app context as the associated support search, so that the model created by the support search is available for use. You should periodically re-run the support search to rebuild the model with the latest data available in your environment.\
This search produces fields (`query`,`query_length`,`count`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** DNS Query, **Field:** query\
1. \
1. **Label:** DNS Query Length, **Field:** query_length\

[ESCU - Detect API activity from users without MFA - Rule]
action.escu = 0
action.escu.enabled = 1
description = This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user logged into the AWS account, is making API calls and has not enabled Multi Factor authentication. Multi factor authentication adds a layer of security by forcing the users to type a unique authentication code from an approved authentication device when they access AWS websites or services. AWS Best Practices recommend that you enable MFA for privileged IAM users.
action.escu.mappings = {"cis20": ["CIS 16"], "mitre_attack": ["Execution"], "nist": ["DE.DP", "PR.AC"]}
action.escu.eli5 =  In this search, we query CloudTrail logs and specifically look for events where the multi factor authentication context of the user's session is false which basically means, that the user does not have MFA enabled on AWS. We then filter out all the known AWS service accounts since service accounts typically do not have MFA enabled. The search then creates a table of the first and last time a user without MFA was detected, the values and count of the API calls made, the type of user identity, ARN and the name of the user.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail inputs. Leverage the support search `Create a list of approved AWS service accounts`: run it once every 30 days to create a list of service accounts and validate them.\
This search produces fields (`eventName`,`userIdentity.type`,`userIdentity.arn`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** AWS Event Name, **Field:** eventName\

action.escu.known_false_positives = Many service accounts configured within an AWS infrastructure do not have multi factor authentication enabled. Please ignore the service accounts, if triggered and instead add them to the aws_service_accounts.csv file to fine tune the detection. It is also possible that the search detects users in your environment using Single Sign-On systems, since the MFA is not handled by AWS.

action.escu.how_to_implement = You need to ingest data from your DNS logs in the Network_Resolution datamodel. Specifically you must ingest the domain that is being queried and the IP of the host originating the request. Ideally, you should also be ingesting the answer to the query and the query type. This approach allows you to also create your own localized passive DNS capability which can aid you in future investigations. You will have to add legitimate domain names to the `legit_domains.csv` file shipped with the app. \

action.escu.eli5 = This search works by looking at fields in the Network_Traffic data model, which is populated by various firewalls and passive networking monitoring technologies. Specifically, the search looks for ICMP packets larger than 1,000 bytes with a destination that is external to your organization.
action.escu.how_to_implement = In order to run this search effectively, we highly recommend that you leverage the Assets and Identity framework. It is important that you have a good understanding of how your network segments are designed and that you are able to distinguish internal from external address space. Add a category named `internal` to the CIDRs that host the company's assets in the `assets_by_cidr.csv` lookup file, which is located in `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-IdentityManagement/lookups/`. More information on updating this lookup can be found here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.0.0/Admin/Addassetandidentitydata.

action.escu.known_false_positives = ICMP packets are used in a variety of ways to help troubleshoot networking issues and ensure the proper flow of traffic. As such, it is possible that a large ICMP packet could be perfectly legitimate. If large ICMP packets are associated with command and control traffic, there will typically be a large number of these packets observed over time. If the search is providing a large number of false positives, you can modify the search to adjust the byte threshold or whitelist specific IP addresses, as necessary.

It will return the user account that was added, the Security ID, the group name to which the user was added, the account name of the user who initiated the action, and the subsequent message returned.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You must be ingesting Windows Security logs. You must also enable the account change auditing here:http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Data/MonitorWindowseventlogdata.

More information on how to enable them can be found here: http://whatevernetworks.com/auditing-group-membership-changes-in-active-directory/. Finally, please make sure that the local administrator group name is "Administrators" to be able to look for the right group membership changes.\
This search produces fields (`Security_ID`,`Group_Name`,`Message`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable.

description = This search looks for outbound SMB connections made by hosts within your network to the Internet. SMB traffic is used for Windows file-sharing activity.

action.escu.eli5 = In this search, we are looking for the network connections that were not blocked by the firewall and that are destined for destination port 139 or 445. We then filter out events that have Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks categorized as internal in the `assets_by_cidr.csv` lookup file which is located in `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-IdentityManagement/lookups/`. Since we are only looking for outbound traffic from the hosts made to the Internet, we filter out traffic whose destination IP address is private.
action.escu.how_to_implement = In order to run this search effectively, we highly recommend that you leverage the Assets and Identity framework. It is important that you have good understanding of how your network segments are designed, and be able to distinguish internal from external address space. Add a category named `internal` to the CIDRs that host the company's assets in `assets_by_cidr.csv` lookup file, which is located in `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-IdentityManagement/lookups/`. More information on updating this lookup can be found here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.0.0/Admin/Addassetandidentitydata. This search also requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model
action.escu.known_false_positives = It is likely that the outbound Server Message Block (SMB) traffic is legitimate, if the company's internal networks are not well-defined in the Assets and Identity Framework. Categorize the internal CIDR blocks as `internal` in the lookup file to avoid creating notable events for traffic destined to those CIDR blocks. Any other network connection that is going out to the Internet should be investigated and blocked. Best practices suggest preventing external communications of all SMB versions and related protocols at the network boundary.

description = This search looks for events where `PsExec.exe` is run with the `accepteula` flag in the command line. PsExec is a built-in Windows utility that enables you to execute processes on other systems. It is fully interactive for console applications. This tool is widely used for launching interactive command prompts on remote systems. Threat actors leverage this extensively for executing code on compromised systems. If an attacker is running PsExec for the first time, they will be prompted to accept the end-user license agreement (EULA), which can be passed as the argument `accepteula` within the command line.

action.escu.eli5 = This search and its corresponding subsearch run through a series of steps, as per the following: \
1. Retrieves all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls.\
1. Kicks off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out the ARN into a more friendly format.\
1. Counts the number of API calls per ARN.\
1. Loads the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\
1. Drops the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merges the rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \
1. Renames `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\
1. Calculates the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting the past much more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation--weighting the past more heavily than the current.\
1. Updates the cache file with the latest results.\
1. Sets the minimum threshold for the number of data points and sets the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\
1. Makes a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\
1. Filters out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of all the API calls, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for each of these ARNs. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine. The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike.\
This search produces fields (`eventName`,`numberOfApiCalls`,`uniqueApisCalled`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** AWS Event Name, **Field:** eventName\

action.escu.eli5 = This search and its corresponding subsearch run through the following series of steps: \
1. Retrieves all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls specifically for security groups.\
1. Kicks off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out the ARN into a more friendly format.\
1. Counts the number of API calls per ARN.\
1. Loads the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from the latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\
1. Drops the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merges the rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \
1. Renames `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\
1. Calculates the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting the past much more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard deviation--weighting the past more heavily than the current.\
1. Updates the cache file with the latest results.\
1. Sets the minimum threshold for the number of data points and sets the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\
1. Makes a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\
1. Filters out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of all the API calls, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for each of these ARNs. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.

description = Malicious actors often abuse legitimate Dynamic DNS services to host malicious payloads or interactive command and control nodes.

This search will look for DNS queries made from within your infrastructure to suspicious dynamic domains.

action.escu.eli5 = The search leverages an accelerated `Network_Resolution` data model to count and list the values of resolved domains for each DNS query. It checks the results against the list of Dynamic DNS providers in the lookup `dynamic_dns_providers` by each host (DNS.src).
action.escu.how_to_implement = First, you'll need to ingest data from your DNS operations. This can be done by ingesting logs from your server or data, collected passively by Splunk Stream or a similar solution. Specifically, data that contains the domain that is being queried and the IP of the host originating the request must be populating the `Network_Resolution` data model. This search also leverages a lookup file, `dynamic_dns_providers_default.csv`, which contains a non-exhaustive list of Dynamic DNS providers. Please consider updating the local lookup periodically by adding new domains to the list of `dynamic_dns_providers_local.csv`.\
This search produces fields (query, answer, isDynDNS) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the notable event. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review.

action.escu.enabled = 1
description = This search is used to detect DNS tunneling, by calculating the sum of the length of DNS queries and DNS answers. The search also filters out potential false positives by filtering out queries made to internal systems and the queries originating from internal DNS, Web, and Email servers. Endpoints using DNS as a method of transmission for data exfiltration, command and control, or evasion of security controls can often be detected by noting an unusually large volume of DNS traffic.

action.escu.eli5 = The search will calculate the distinct count and sum of the length of DNS queries made and DNS answers received by a particular host to alert the analyst if the combined length is greater than 10000, which is not typical behavior.
action.escu.how_to_implement = To successfully implement this search, we must ensure that DNS data is being ingested and mapped to the appropriate fields in the Network_Resolution data model. Fields like src_category are automatically provided by the Assets and Identity Framework shipped with Splunk Enterprise Security. You will need to ensure you are using the Assets and Identity Framework and populating the src_category field. You will also need to enable the `cim_corporate_web_domain_search()` macro which will essentially filter out the DNS queries made to the corporate web domains to reduce alert fatigue.
action.escu.known_false_positives = It's possible that normal DNS traffic will exhibit this behavior. If an alert is generated, please investigate and validate as appropriate. The threshold can also be modified to better suit your environment.

Specifically, it checks to see whether spaces make up more than 10% of the number of characters in the file name. This percentage can be tuned for each environment. The search will output the message ID of the email, the count, the sender and recipient addresses, the first and last time this event was seen, and the space ratio of the file attachment name.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You need to ingest data from emails. Specifically, the sender's address and the file names of any attachments must be mapped to the Email data model. The threshold ratio is set to 10%, but this value can be configured to suit each environment. \
 **Splunk Phantom Playbook Integration**\
If Splunk Phantom is also configured in your environment, a playbook called "Suspicious Email Attachment Investigate and Delete" can be configured to run when any results are found by this detection search. To use this integration, install the Phantom App for Splunk `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/` and add the correct hostname to the "Phantom Instance" field in the Adaptive Response Actions when configuring this detection search. The notable event will be sent to Phantom and the playbook will gather further information about the file attachment and its network behaviors. If Phantom finds malicious behavior and an analyst approves of the results, the email will be deleted from the user's inbox.

action.escu.eli5 = This search may look complex, but it's a neat representation of how statistics can help you understand your dataset to bubble up events that are not normal compared to its behavior. The search consists of three parts. The first part of the SPL fetches the data you want to work on. In this search, we calculate the sum of bytes sent and bytes_out from systems categorized as email_server to each host. We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host. Finally, it includes the number of standard deviations away the byte count was from these averages.
action.escu.how_to_implement = This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.  Your email servers must be categorized as "email_server" for the search to work, as well.

The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.

action.escu.eli5 = This search may look complex, but it's a neat representation of how statistics can help you understand your dataset to bubble up events that are not normal compared to its behavior. The search consists of three parts. The first part of the SPL fetches the data you want to work on. In this search, we calculate the sum of bytes sent and bytes_out from systems categorized as email_server to each host. We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host. Finally, it includes the number of standard deviations away the byte count was from these averages.

By default, the policy is set to "Restricted," which disables the execution of PowerShell scripts. In environments that make heavy use of PowerShell, the policy can be set to allow only scripts signed by a trusted publisher. Malicious PowerShell use almost always includes the parameter `-ExecutionPolicy bypass`. PowerShell is very liberal when it comes to interpreting command-line parameters passed to it. For example, the parameter we look for, `-ExecutionPolicy`, can be abbreviated to `-Execution`, `-Exec`, or even `-ex`. As such, we look for `* -ex*`, which should catch all variations of this parameter, followed by the keyword `bypass`.

Attackers have also used SMB for lateral movement with a target environment and to test credentials against target systems. While SMB is highly prevalent in Windows environments, a spike in SMB traffic may still be indicative of this type of malicious activity. This search leverages Splunk's Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to identify spikes in SMB traffic that are unusual for a given hour of day/day of week combination. If such a spike is detected, you may want to investigate the source and analyze the cause of the abnormal traffic. The determination of what is considered an outlier may be adjusted via the threshold parameter in the search. More information on the algorithm used can be found at `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/4.2.0/User/Algorithms#DensityFunction`.
action.escu.how_to_implement = To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. In addition, the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version 4.2 or greater must be installed on your search heads, along with any required dependencies. Finally, the support search "Baseline of SMB Traffic - MLTK" must be executed before this detection search, because it builds a machine-learning (ML) model over the historical data used by this search. It is important that this search is run in the same app context as the associated support search, so that the model created by the support search is available for use. You should periodically re-run the support search to rebuild the model with the latest data available in your environment.\

Finally, the support search "Baseline of Command Line Length - MLTK" must be executed before this detection search, as it builds an ML model over the historical data used by this search.

action.escu.mappings = {"cis20": ["CIS 16"], "kill_chain_phases": ["Actions on Objectives"], "mitre_attack": ["Persistence", "Create Account"], "nist": ["DE.CM", "DE.DP"]}
action.escu.eli5 = When a fraudster is setting the stage for a campaign, they will often create many user accounts on the website. This is a simple example of how to detect a many-account creation hosted on a Magento2 e-commerce platform, where the fraudster is using email addresses from a single email domain.
action.escu.how_to_implement = We start with a dataset that provides visibility into the email address used for the account creation. In this example, we are narrowing our search down to the single web page that hosts the Magento2 e-commerce platform (via URI) used for account creation, the single http content-type to grab only the user's clicks, and the http field that provides the username (form_data), for performance reasons.  After we have the username and email domain, we look for numerous account creations per email domain.  Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs or Splunk Stream.
action.escu.known_false_positives = As is common with many fraud-related searches, we are usually looking to attribute risk or synthesize relevant context with loosely written detections that simply detect anamolous behavior. This search will need to be customized to fit your environment&#151;improving its fidelity by counting based on something much more specific, such as a device ID that may be present in your dataset. Consideration for whether the large number of registrations are occuring from a first-time seen domain may also be important.  Extending the search window to look further back in time, or even calculating the average per hour/day for each email domain to look for an anomalous spikes, will improve this search.  You can also use Shannon entropy or Levenshtein Distance (both courtesy of URL Toolbox) to consider the randomness or similarity of the email name or email domain, as the names are often machine-generated.

action.escu.how_to_implement = Start with a dataset that allows you to see clickstream data for each user click on the website. That data must have a time stamp and must contain a reference to the session identifier being used by the website. This ties the clicks together into clickstreams. This value is usually found in the http cookie. With a bit of tuning, a version of this search could be used in high-volume scenarios, such as scraping, crawling, application DDOS, credit-card testing, account takeover, etc. Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs, customized IIS, and Splunk Stream.

action.escu.eli5 = The hosts file is present on both Windows and Linux endpoints. The purpose of the hosts file is to provide a mapping between hostnames and IP addresses, the same way DNS is used to provide such a mapping. However, the information in the hosts file takes precedence over information received via DNS and a DNS query will not be issued if the hostname of interest is found in the hosts file. As such, attackers have been observed adding entries to the host file to override any DNS resolution. For this reason, it is useful to monitor for changes to this file, which typically do not occur very often in legitimate cases.

This may help identify spikes in SMB traffic that may be indicative of attackers scanning or attempting to propagate to other systems in your environment. By default, this model is built over 30 days of data and profiles the number of SMB connections in your environment by the hour of day/day of week that the connections occur.
action.escu.how_to_implement = You must be ingesting network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model. In addition, you must have the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version >= 4.2 installed, along with any required dependencies. To improve your results, you may consider adding "src" to the by clause, which will build the model for each unique source in your enviornment. However, if you have a large number of hosts in your environment, this search may be very resource intensive. In this case, you may need to raise the value of max_inputs and/or max_groups in the MLTK settings for the DensityFunction algorithm, then ensure that the search completes in a reasonable timeframe. By default, the search builds the model using the past 30 days of data. You can modify the search window to build the model over a longer period of time, which may give you better results. You may also want to periodically re-run this search to rebuild the model with the latest data. More information on the algorithm used in the search can be found at `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/4.2.0/User/Algorithms#DensityFunction`.
