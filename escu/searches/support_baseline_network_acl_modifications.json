It returns all logged API calls for network activity, pulls out the ARN that initiated each call, and collects the <code>eventNames</code> in one-hour groupings. Next, it calculates the number of API calls made per ARN per-hour. For each ARN, it calculates the average and standard deviation of this count on a per-hour basis. It also includes the number of data points for each ARN. This table is stored in a lookup file.",
