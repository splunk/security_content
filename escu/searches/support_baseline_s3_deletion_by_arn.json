It returns all logged API calls for S3 bucket-deletion activity and then pulls out the ARN that initiated each call. Next, it calculates the number of API calls made per ARN per hour. For each ARN, it calculates the average and standard deviation of this count on a per-hour basis. It also includes the number of data points for each ARN. This table is stored in a lookup file.",
