It is typical for users to change the file association to open certain types of files with specific applications. However, when these changes are legitimately performed, they are typically done via the processes explorer.exe or openwith.exe. The search looks at Sysmon data with an event code of 13, which specifies setting a value in the registry. It then looks at the object path for these changes for matches to the area responsible for file associations and excludes changes made by the processes noted as typically being legitimate.",
