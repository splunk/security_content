This search returns all log events that correspond to a blocked outbound network connection, extracts the source IP from where the outbound connection was initiated, and collects the events in one-hour groupings. Next, it calculates the number of outbound connections blocked per hour. For each source IP, it calculates the average and standard deviation of this count on a per-hour basis.  It also includes the number of data points each source IP had. This table is then stored in a lookup file.",
