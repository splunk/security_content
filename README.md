# Splunk Security Content
![security_content](docs/static/logo.png)
=====

Welcome to the Splunk Security Content

This project gives you access to our repository of Analytic Stories, security guides that provide background on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, and CIS Controls. They include Splunk searches, machine learning algorithms and Splunk Phantom playbooks (where available)‚Äîall designed to work together to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

# Get Contentüõ°
The latest Splunk Security Content can be obtained via:

#### [SSE App](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/)
Grab the latest release of Splunk Security Essentials App and install it on a Splunk instance. You can download it from [splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/), it is a Splunk Supported App. SSE Splunk app today supports push updates for security content release, this is the **preferred way** to get content!

#### [ESCU App](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/releases)
Grab the latest release of DA-ESS-ContentUpdate.spl and install it on a Splunk instance. Alternatively, you can download it from [splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/), it is currently a Splunk Supported App.

#### [API](https://docs.splunkresearch.com/?version=latest)
```
curl -s https://content.splunkresearch.com | jq
{
  "hello": "welcome to Splunks Research security content api"
}
```

# Usage üß∞
### contentctl.py 
The Content Control tool allows you to manipulate Splunk Security Content via the following actions: 

1. **new** - Creates new content (detection, story, baseline)
2. **validate** - Validates written content
3. **generate** - Generates a deployment package for different platforms (splunk_app)

### pre-requisites

```
git clone git@github.com:splunk/security_content.git
cd security_content
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### create a new detection 
`python contentctl.py new` 

for a more indepth write up on how to write content see our [guide](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Developing-Content).

### create a new analytic story 
`python contentctl.py new -t story` 

### validate written content a new analytic story 
`python contentctl.py --verbose validate` 

### generate a splunk app from current content
`python contentctl.py --path . --verbose generate --output package` 

# MITRE ATT&CK ‚öîÔ∏è
### Detection Coverage
To view an up-to-date detection coverage map for all the content tagged with MITRE techniques visit: [https://mitremap.splunkresearch.com/](https://mitremap.splunkresearch.com/) under the **Detection Coverage** layer. Below is a snapshot in time of what technique we currently have some detection coverage for. The darker the shade of blue the more detections we have for this particular technique. This map is automatically updated on every release and generated from the [generate-coverage-map.py](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/bin/generate-coverage-map.py).

# Customize to your Environment üèó
Customize your content to change how [often detections run](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Customize-to-Your-Environment#customizing-scheduling-and-alert-actions-with-deployments), or what the right source type for [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Customize-to-Your-Environment#customizing-source-types-with-macros) in your environment is please follow this [guide](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Customize-to-Your-Environment).  

# What's in an Analytic Story? üó∫
A complete use case, specifically built to detect, investigate, and respond to a specific threat like [Credential Dumping](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/stories/credential_dumping.yml) or [Ransomware](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/stories/ransomware.yml). A group of detections and a response make up an analytic story, they are associated with the tag `analytic_story: <name>`.  

# Content Parts üß©

* [detections/](detections/): Contains all 209 detection searches to-date and growing.
* [stories/](stories/): All Analytic Stories that are group detections or also known as Use Cases
* [deployments/](deployments/): Configuration for the schedule and alert action for all content
* [responses/](responses/): Incident Response Playbooks/Workflow for responding to a specific Use Case or Threat.
* [response_tasks/](response_tasks/): Individual steps in responses that help the user investigate via a Splunk search, automate via a phantom playbook, and visualize via dashboards threats.
* [baselines/](baselines/): Searches that must be executed before a detection runs. It is specifically useful for collecting data on a system before running your detection on the collected data.
* [dashboards/](dashboards/): JSON definitions of Mission Control dashboards, to be used as a response task. Currently not used.
* [macros/](macros/): Implements Splunk‚Äôs search macros, shortcuts to commonly used search patterns like sysmon source type. More on how macros are used to customize content below.
* [lookups/](lookups/): Implements Splunk‚Äôs lookup, usually to provide a list of static values like commonly used ransomware extensions.
