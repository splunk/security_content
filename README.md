# Splunk Security Content
![security_content](docs/static/logo.png)
=====

Welcome to the Splunk Security Content

This project gives you access to our repository of Analytic Stories, security guides that provide background on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, and CIS Controls. They include Splunk searches, machine learning algorithms and Splunk Phantom playbooks (where available)‚Äîall designed to work together to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

**Note:** We have sister projects that enable us to build the industry's best security content. These projects are the Splunk Attack Range, an attack simulation lab built around Splunk, and Contentctl, the tool that enables us to build, test, and package our content for distribution.

- [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range): An attack simulation lab built around Splunk.
- [Contentctl](https://github.com/splunk/contentctl): The tool that enables us to build, test, and package our content for distribution.

# Get Contentüõ°
The latest Splunk Security Content can be obtained via:
 
### üåê [Website](https://research.splunk.com/)

Best way to discover and access our content is by using the [research.splunk.com](https://research.splunk.com/) website.

### üñ•Ô∏è [Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) Content Update](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/latest/Admin/Usecasecontentlibrary?#Update_the_Analytic_Stories)

Splunk security content ships as part of ESCU directly into, if you are an ES user, good news, you already have it!

### üì¶ [ESCU App](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/releases)

To manually download the latest release of Splunk Security Content (named DA-ESS-ContentUpdate.spl), you can visit the [splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/) page or the [release page](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/releases) on GitHub.

# Tools üß∞
The key tool that drives our content development is [contentctl](https://github.com/splunk/contentctl). Contentctl offers the following features:

- Creating new detections
- Validating the correctness of all necessary components for detections
- Testing detections
- Generating deployable apps from detections

To learn more about contentctl and its capabilities, please visit the [contentctl repository](https://github.com/splunk/contentctl).

### Detection Coverage
To view an up-to-date detection coverage map for all the content tagged with MITRE techniques visit: [https://mitremap.splunkresearch.com/](https://mitremap.splunkresearch.com/) under the **Detection Coverage** layer. Below is a snapshot in time of what technique we currently have some detection coverage for.

# Content Parts üß©

* [detections/](detections/): Contains all detection searches to-date and growing.
* [stories/](stories/): All Analytic Stories that are group detections or also known as Use Cases
* [deployments/](deployments/): Configuration for the schedule and alert action for all content
* [playbooks/](playbooks/): Incident Response Playbooks/Workflow for responding to a specific Use Case or Threat.
* [baselines/](baselines/): Searches that must be executed before a detection runs. It is specifically useful for collecting data on a system before running your detection on the collected data.
* [investigations/](investigations/): Investigations to further analyze the output from detections. For more information, you can refer to the [Splunk Enterprise Security documentation on timelines](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/7.3.0/User/Timelines).
* [macros/](macros/): Implements Splunk‚Äôs search macros, shortcuts to commonly used search patterns like sysmon source type. More on how macros are used to customize content below.
* [lookups/](lookups/): Implements Splunk‚Äôs lookup, usually to provide a list of static values like commonly used ransomware extensions.
* [data_sources/](data_sources/): Defines the data sources, the necessary TA or App to collect them and the fields provided that can be used by the detections.
