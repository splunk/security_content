description: This search creates permutations of your existing domains, removes the
  valid domain names and stores them in a specified lookup file so they can be checked
  for in the associated detection searches.
eli5: This search starts with the dnstwist command consuming domains from a file called
  domains.csv in the DA-ESS-SOC/lookups directory. This search then adds a domain\_abuse=true
  term to each permutation, removes all the valid domain names and stores all that
  information into a lookup file that is used in the associated detection search.
  Alternatively domain dnstwist permutations can be calculated from domains in the
  `cim_corporate_email_domains.csv` and `cim_corporate_web_domains.csv` lookups located
  in **Splunk\_SA\_CIM** using argument `populate_from_cim=true`. Also an individual
  domain can be passed using argument `domain=<domain>`
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to update the file
  called domains.csv in the DA-ESS-SOC/lookup directory. Or `cim_corporate_email_domains.csv`
  and `cim_corporate_web_domains.csv` from **Splunk\_SA\_CIM**.
