description: This search is used to build a Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) model
  to characterize the length of the DNS queries for each DNS record type observed
  in the environment. By default, the search uses the last 30 days of data to build
  the model. The model created by this search is then used in the corresponding detection
  search, which uses it to identify outliers in the length of the DNS query.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that
  DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. In addition, you must
  have the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version >= 4.2 installed, along with any
  required dependencies. By default, the search builds the model using the past 30
  days of data. You can modify the search window to build the model over a longer
  period of time, which may give you better results. You may also want to periodically
  re-run this search to rebuild the model with the latest data. More information on
  the algorithm used in the search can be found at `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/4.2.0/User/Algorithms#DensityFunction`.
