description: This search returns the first and last time a process was seen per endpoint
  with a parent process of zoom.exe (Windows) or zoom.us (macOS). This table is then
  cached.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints, to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node.
