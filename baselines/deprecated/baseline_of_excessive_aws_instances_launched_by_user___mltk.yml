description: This search is used to build a Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) model
  for how many RunInstances users do in the environment. By default, the search uses
  the last 90 days of data to build the model. The model created by this search is
  then used in the corresponding detection search, which identifies subsequent outliers
  in the number of RunInstances performed by a user in a small time window.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=RunInstances errorCode=success `ec2_excessive_runinstances_mltk_input_filter`
  | bucket span=10m _time | stats count as instances_launched by _time src_user |
  fit DensityFunction instances_launched threshold=0.0005 into ec2_excessive_runinstances_v1'
how_to_implement: 'You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.\

  In addition, you must have the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version >= 4.2 installed,
  along with any required dependencies. Depending on the number of users in your environment,
  you may also need to adjust the value for max_inputs in the MLTK settings for the
  DensityFunction algorithm, then ensure that the search completes in a reasonable
  timeframe. By default, the search builds the model using the past 30 days of data.
  You can modify the search window to build the model over a longer period of time,
  which may give you better results. You may also want to periodically re-run this
  search to rebuild the model with the latest data.\

  More information on the algorithm used in the search can be found at `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/4.2.0/User/Algorithms#DensityFunction`.'
