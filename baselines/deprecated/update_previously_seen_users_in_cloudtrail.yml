type: Baseline
datamodel: []
description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user logs into the console,
  then updates the baseline of the latest and earliest times, City, Region, and Country
  we have encountered this user in our dataset, grouped by ARN, within the last hour.
  NOTE - This baseline search is deprecated and has been updated to use the Authentication
  Datamodel
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin | rename userIdentity.arn as user | iplocation
  src | eval City=if(City LIKE "",src,City),Region=if(Region LIKE "",src,Region) |
  stats earliest(_time) AS firstTime latest(_time) AS lastTime by user src City Region
  Country | inputlookup append=t previously_seen_users_console_logins_cloudtrail |
  stats min(firstTime) as firstTime max(lastTime) as lastTime by user src City Region
  Country | outputlookup previously_seen_users_console_logins_cloudtrail'
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Please validate the user name entries in `previously_seen_users_console_logins_cloudtrail`,
  which is a lookup file created as a result of running this support search.
