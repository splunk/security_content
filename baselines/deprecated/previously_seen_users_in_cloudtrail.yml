description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user logs into the console,
  then creates a baseline of the latest and earliest times, City, Region, and Country
  we have encountered this user in our dataset, grouped by ARN, within the last 30
  days. NOTE - This baseline search is deprecated and has been updated to use the
  Authentication Datamodel
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin | rename userIdentity.arn as user | iplocation
  src | eval City=if(City LIKE "",src,City),Region=if(Region LIKE "",src,Region) |
  stats earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime by user src City Region
  Country | outputlookup previously_seen_users_console_logins_cloudtrail | stats count'
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Please validate the user name entries in `previously_seen_users_console_logins_cloudtrail`,
  which is a lookup file created as a result of running this support search.
