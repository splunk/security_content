description: This search looks for **AssumeRole** events where the requesting account differs from the requested account, then writes these relationships to a lookup file.
how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 5.1.0 or later)and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Validate the user name entries in `previously_seen_aws_cross_account_activity.csv`, a lookup file created by this support search.
