description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user logs into the console,
  then updates the baseline of the latest and earliest times, City, Region, and Country
  we have encountered this user in our dataset, grouped by ARN, within the last hour.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Please validate the user name entries in `previously_seen_users_console_logins.csv`,
  which is a lookup file created as a result of running this support search.
