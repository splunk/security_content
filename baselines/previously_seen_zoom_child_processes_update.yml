name: Previously Seen Zoom Child Processes - Update
id: 80aea7fd-5da2-4533-b3c2-560533bfbaee

description: This search returns the first and last time a process was seen per endpoint with
    a parent process of zoom.exe (Windows) or zoom.us (macOS) within the last hour. It then updates
    this information with historical data and filters out proces_name and endpoint pairs that have not
    been seen within the specified time window. This updated table is outputed to disk.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints, to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node.
