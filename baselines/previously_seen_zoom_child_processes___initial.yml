type: Baseline
datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: This search returns the first and last time a process was seen per endpoint
  with a parent process of zoom.exe (Windows) or zoom.us (macOS). This table is then
  cached.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTimeSeen max(_time)
  as lastTimeSeen from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name=zoom.exe
  OR Processes.parent_process_name=zoom.us) by Processes.process_name Processes.dest|
  `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | table dest, process_name, firstTimeSeen, lastTimeSeen
  | outputlookup zoom_first_time_child_process'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints, to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node.
