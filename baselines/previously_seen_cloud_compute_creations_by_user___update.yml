description: This search builds a table of previously seen users that have launched
  a cloud compute instance.
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTimeSeen, latest(_time) as lastTimeSeen
  from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.action=created AND All_Changes.object_category=instance

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting the approrpiate cloud infrastructure logs
  and have the proper TAs installed.
