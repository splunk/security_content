description: This search counts the numbers of times the system has created remote
  desktop traffic
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you must ingest network traffic
  and populate the Network_Traffic data model. If a system receives a lot of remote
  desktop traffic, you can apply the category common_rdp_destination to it.
