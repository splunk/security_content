description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user logs into the console,
  then updates the baseline of the latest and earliest times, City, Region, and Country
  we have encountered this user in our dataset, grouped by user, within the last hour.
how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version
  5.1.0 or later) and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates
  to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Validate the user name entries
  in `previously_seen_users_console_logins`, which is a lookup file created by this
  support search.
