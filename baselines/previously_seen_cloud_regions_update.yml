name: Previously Seen Cloud Regions - Update
id: 512f928a-a461-41b4-8984-db4dd2c472e4
version: 1

description: This search looks for cloud compute events where a compute instance is
  started and creates a baseline of most recent time, `lastTime` and the first time
  `firstTime` we've seen this region in our dataset grouped by the region for the
  last 30 days
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting the approrpiate cloud infrastructure logs
  and have the Security Research cloud data model installed.
