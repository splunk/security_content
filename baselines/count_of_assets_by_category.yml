description: This search shows you every asset category you have and the assets that
  belong to those categories.
search: '| from datamodel Identity_Management.All_Assets | stats count values(nt_host)
  by category | sort -count'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you must first leverage the
  Assets and Identity framework in Enterprise Security to populate your assets_by_str.csv
  file which should then be mapped to the Identity_Management data model. The Identity_Management
  data model will contain a list of known authorized company assets. Ensure that all
  inventoried systems are constantly vetted and updated.
