description: This search looks for successful API activity in CloudTrail within the
  last 30 days, filters out known users from the identity table, and outputs values
  of users into `aws_service_accounts.csv` lookup file.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Please validate the service account entires in `aws_service_accounts.csv`,
  which is a lookup file created as a result of running this support search. Please
  remove the entries of service accounts that are not legitimate.
