description: This search establishes, on a per-hour basis, the average and standard
  deviation for the number of API calls related to deleting an S3 bucket by each user.
  Also recorded is the number of data points for each user. This table is then outputted
  to a lookup file to allow the detection search to operate quickly.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS version (4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
