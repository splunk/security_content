description: This search builds a table of the first and last times seen for every
  IP address (along with its physical location) previously associated with cloud-provisioning
  activity. This is broadly defined as any event that runs or creates something. This
  table is then cached.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider.
