date: '2020-05-28'
description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user logs into the console,
  then creates a baseline of the latest and earliest times, City, Region, and Country
  we have encountered this user in our dataset, grouped by username, within the last 30
  days.
how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates to the Authentication data model  
  for cloud use cases. Validate the user name entries in `previously_seen_users_console_logins`,
  which is a lookup file created by this support search.
