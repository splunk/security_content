description: This search creates permutations of your existing domains, removes the
  valid domain names and stores them in a specified lookup file so they can be checked
  for in the associated detection searches.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to update the file
  called domains.csv in the DA-ESS-SOC/lookup directory. Or `cim_corporate_email_domains.csv`
  and `cim_corporate_web_domains.csv` from **Splunk\_SA\_CIM**.
