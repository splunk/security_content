description: This search builds a table of previously seen users that have modified
  a cloud instance.
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTimeSeen, latest(_time) as lastTimeSeen
  from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.action=modified All_Changes.change_type=EC2
  c=success by All_Changes.user | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | eventstats
  min(firstTimeSeen) as globalFirstTime | eval enough_data = if(globalFirstTime <=
  relative_time(now(), "-7d@d"), 1, 0) | outputlookup previously_seen_cloud_instance_modifications_by_user'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting the approrpiate cloud infrastructure logs
  and have the latest Change Datamodel accelerated.
