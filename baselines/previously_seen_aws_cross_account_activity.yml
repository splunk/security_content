description: This search looks for **AssumeRole** events where the requesting account
  differs from the requested account, then writes these relationships to a lookup
  file.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Validate the user name entries in `previously_seen_aws_cross_account_activity.csv`,
  a lookup file created by this support search.
