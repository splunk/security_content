description: This search establishes, on a per-hour basis, the average and the standard
  deviation of the number of outbound connections blocked in your VPC flow logs by
  each source IP address (IP address of your EC2 instances). Also recorded is the
  number of data points for each source IP. This table outputs to a lookup file to
  allow the detection search to operate quickly.
search: '`cloudwatchlogs_vpcflow` action=blocked (src_ip=10.0.0.0/8 OR src_ip=172.16.0.0/12
  OR src_ip=192.168.0.0/16) ( dest_ip!=10.0.0.0/8 AND dest_ip!=172.16.0.0/12 AND dest_ip!=192.168.0.0/16)
  | bucket _time span=1h | stats count as numberOfBlockedConnections by _time, src_ip
  | stats count(numberOfBlockedConnections) as numDataPoints, latest(numberOfBlockedConnections)
  as latestCount, avg(numberOfBlockedConnections) as avgBlockedConnections, stdev(numberOfBlockedConnections)
  as stdevBlockedConnections by src_ip | table src_ip, latestCount, numDataPoints,
  avgBlockedConnections, stdevBlockedConnections | outputlookup baseline_blocked_outbound_connections
  | stats count'
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS version (4.4.0 or later), then configure your `VPC flow
  logs.`.
