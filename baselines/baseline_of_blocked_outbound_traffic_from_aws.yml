description: This search establishes, on a per-hour basis, the average and the standard
  deviation of the number of outbound connections blocked in your VPC flow logs by
  each source IP address (IP address of your EC2 instances). Also recorded is the
  number of data points for each source IP. This table outputs to a lookup file to
  allow the detection search to operate quickly.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS version (4.4.0 or later), then configure your `VPC flow
  logs.`.
