description: This search establishes, on a per-hour basis, the average and the standard
  deviation of the number of API calls made by each user. Also recorded is the number
  of data points for each user. This table is then outputted to a lookup file to allow
  the detection search to operate quickly.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS version (4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
