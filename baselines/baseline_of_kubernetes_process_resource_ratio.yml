datamodel: []
description: This baseline rule calculates the average and standard deviation of the ratio of various process resources in a Kubernetes environment. 
  It uses metrics from the Kubernetes API and the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on. The rule generates a lookup table with the average and 
  standard deviation of the resource ratios for each process. This baseline can be used to detect anomalies in process resource utilization, 
  which may indicate security threats such as resource exhaustion attacks, cryptojacking, or compromised process behavior.

how_to_implement: 'To implement this detection, follow these steps:
  1. Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.
  2. Enable the hostmetrics/process receiver in the OTEL configuration.
  3. Ensure that the process metrics, specifically Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization, are enabled.
  4. Install the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on.(ref: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247) 
  5. Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access Token.
  6. Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input "sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index".
  7. In the SIM configuration, set the Organization ID to your Observability Cloud Organization ID.
  8. Set the Signal Flow Program to the following: data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''A''); data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''B''); data(''process.cpu.time'').publish(label=''C''); data(''process.disk.io'').publish(label=''D''); data(''process.memory.usage'').publish(label=''E''); data(''process.memory.virtual'').publish(label=''F''); data(''process.memory.utilization'').publish(label=''G''); data(''process.cpu.utilization'').publish(label=''H''); data(''process.disk.operations'').publish(label=''I''); data(''process.handles'').publish(label=''J''); data(''process.threads'').publish(label=''K'')
  9. Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.
  10. Leave all other settings at their default values.'
