description: This search returns the first and last time a Windows service was seen
  across your enterprise within the last hour. It then updates this information with
  historical data and filters out Windows services pairs that have not been seen within
  the specified time window. This updated table is then cached.
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7036 | rex field=Message "The (?<service>[-\(\)\s\w]+)
  service entered the (?<state>\w+) state" | where state="running" | stats earliest(_time)
  as firstTimeSeen, latest(_time) as lastTimeSeen by service | inputlookup previously_seen_running_windows_services
  append=t | stats min(firstTimeSeen) as firstTimeSeen, max(lastTimeSeen) as lastTimeSeen
  by service | where lastTimeSeen > relative_time(now(), "`previously_seen_windows_service_forget_window`")
  | outputlookup previously_seen_running_windows_services'
how_to_implement: While this search does not require you to adhere to Splunk CIM,
  you must be ingesting your Windows security-event logs for it to execute successfully.
  Please ensure that the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows is version 8.0.0 or above.
