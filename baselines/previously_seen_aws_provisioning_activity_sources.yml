description: This search builds a table of the first and last times seen for every
  IP address (along with its physical location) previously associated with cloud-provisioning
  activity. This is broadly defined as any event that runs or creates something.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
