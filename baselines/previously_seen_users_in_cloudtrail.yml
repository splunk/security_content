description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user logs into the console,
  then creates a baseline of the latest and earliest times, City, Region, and Country
  we have encountered this user in our dataset, grouped by ARN, within the last 30
  days. NOTE - This baseline search is deprecated and has been updated to use the
  Authentication Datamodel
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Please validate the user name entries in `previously_seen_users_console_logins_cloudtrail`,
  which is a lookup file created as a result of running this support search.
