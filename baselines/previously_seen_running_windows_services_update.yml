description: This search returns the first and last time a Windows service was seen across your enterprise
    within the last hour. It then updates this information with historical data and filters out
    Windows services pairs that have not been seen within the specified time window.
    This updated table is then cached.
how_to_implement: While this search does not require you to adhere to Splunk CIM,
  you must be ingesting your Windows security-event logs for it to execute successfully.
  Please ensure that the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows is version 8.0.0 or above.
