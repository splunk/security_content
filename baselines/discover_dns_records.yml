description: The search takes corporate and common cloud provider domains configured
  under `cim_corporate_email_domains.csv`, `cim_corporate_web_domains.csv`, and `cloud_domains.csv`
  finds their responses across the last 30 days from data in the `Network_Resolution
  ` datamodel, then stores the output under the `discovered_dns_records.csv` lookup
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting DNS
  logs, and populating the Network_Resolution data model. Also make sure that the
  cim_corporate_web_domains and cim_corporate_email_domains lookups are populated
  with the domains owned by your corporation
