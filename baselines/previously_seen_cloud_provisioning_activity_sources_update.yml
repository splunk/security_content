description: This returns the first and last times seen for every IP address (along
  with its physical location) previously associated with cloud-provisioning activity
  within the last day. Cloud provisioning is broadly defined as any event that runs
  or creates something.  It then updates this information with historical data and
  filters out locations that have not been seen within the specified time window.
  This updated table is then cached.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider.
