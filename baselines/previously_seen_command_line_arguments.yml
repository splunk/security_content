description: This search looks for command-line arguments where `cmd.exe /c` is used
  to execute a program, then creates a baseline of the earliest and latest times we
  have encountered this command-line argument in our dataset within the last 30 days.
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must be ingesting
  logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints. The complete
  process name with command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the
  Endpoint data model.
