description: This search is used to build a Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) model
  for how many API calls are performed by each user. By default, the search uses the
  last 90 days of data to build the model and the model is rebuilt weekly. The model
  created by this search is then used in the corresponding detection search, which
  identifies subsequent outliers in the number of instances created in a small time
  window.
how_to_implement: You must have Enterprise Security 6.0 or later, if not you will
  need to verify that the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version 4.2 or later is
  installed, along with any required dependencies. Depending on the number of users
  in your environment, you may also need to adjust the value for max_inputs in the
  MLTK settings for the DensityFunction algorithm, then ensure that the search completes
  in a reasonable timeframe. By default, the search builds the model using the past
  90 days of data. You can modify the search window to build the model over a longer
  period of time, which may give you better results. You may also want to periodically
  re-run this search to rebuild the model with the latest data.
