description: This search looks for successful API calls made by different user roles,
  then creates a baseline of the earliest and latest times we have encountered this
  user role. It also returns the name of the API call in our dataset--grouped by user
  role and name of the API call--that occurred within the last 30 days. In this support
  search, we are only looking for events where the user identity is Assumed Role.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Please validate the user role entries in `previously_seen_api_calls_from_user_roles.csv`,
  which is a lookup file created as a result of running this support search.
