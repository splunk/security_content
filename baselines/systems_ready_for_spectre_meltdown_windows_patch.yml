description: Some AV applications can cause the Spectre/Meltdown patch for Windows
  not to install successfully. This registry key is supposed to be created by the
  AV engine when it has been patched to be able to handle the Windows patch. If this
  key has been written, the system can then be patched for Spectre and Meltdown.
how_to_implement: You need to be ingesting logs with both the process name and command-line
  from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4
  of the Sysmon TA.
