# Welcome to Splunk Security Content

This project gives you access to our repository of Analytic Stories that are security guides which provide background on TTPs, mapped to the MITRE framework, the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain, and CIS controls. They include Splunk searches, machine-learning algorithms, and Splunk Phantom playbooks (where available)‚Äîall designed to work together to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

## [Detection Coverage](https://mitremap.splunkresearch.com/) üó∫
Below is a snapshot in time of what technique we currently have some detection coverage for. The darker the shade of blue the more detections we have for this particular technique.

## Test Out The Detections üèó

Replay any detection dataset to a Splunk Enterprise Server by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui). Alternatively use:

![](static/attack_range.png)

The [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range) which allows you to create a isolated environment to launch attacks and test/build detections.

## Questions? üìû
Please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range/issues) to submit bugs or request features.

If you have questions or need support, you can:

* Join the [#security-research](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com/archives/C1S5BEF38) room in the [Splunk Slack channel](http://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)
* Post a question to [Splunk Answers](http://answers.splunk.com)
* If you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can also open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal
