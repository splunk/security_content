description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of default or publicly known
  named pipes used with Cobalt Strike. A named pipe is a named, one-way or duplex
  pipe for communication between the pipe server and one or more pipe clients. Cobalt
  Strike uses named pipes in many ways and has default values used with the Artifact
  Kit and Malleable C2 Profiles. The following query assists with identifying these
  default named pipes. Each EDR product presents named pipes a little different. Consider
  taking the values and generating a query based on the product of choice. \

  Upon triage, review the process performing the named pipe. If it is explorer.exe,
  It is possible it was injected into by another process. Review recent parallel processes
  to identify suspicious patterns or behaviors. A parallel process may have a network
  connection, review and follow the connection back to identify any file modifications.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: The idea of using named pipes with Cobalt Strike is to blend
  in. Therefore, some of the named pipes identified and added may cause false positives.
  Filter by process name or pipe name to reduce false positives.
