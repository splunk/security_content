This function will copy all artifacts, automation, notes and comments over from every container within the container_list into the target_container.

A note will be left in the child containers with a link to the target container. The child containers will be marked as evidence within the target container. \n\nAny notes left as a consequence of the merge process will be skipped in subsequent merges.",
