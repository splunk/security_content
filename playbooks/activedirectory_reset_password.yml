description: This playbook resets the password of a potentially compromised user account. First, an analyst is prompted to evaluate the situation and choose whether to reset the account. If they approve, a strong password is generated and the password is reset.
playbook: activedirectory_reset_password
how_to_implement: This playbook works on artifacts with artifact:*.cef.compromisedUserName which can be created as shown in the playbook "recorded_future_handle_leaked_credentials" - The prompt is hard-coded to use "admin" as the user, so change it to the correct user or role
