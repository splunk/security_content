description: This playbook acts upon events where a file has been determined to be malicious (ie webshells being dropped on an end host). Before deleting the file, we run a "more" command on the file in question to extract its contents. We then run a delete on the file in question.
playbook: delete_detected_files
how_to_implement: This playbook reads and then deletes files stored with artifact:*.cef.filePath from hosts stored in artifact:*.cef.destinationAddress. Windows Remote Management must be enabled on the remote computer.
