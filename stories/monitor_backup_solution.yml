narrative: Having backups is a standard best practice that helps ensure continuity
  of business operations.  Having mature backup processes can also help you reduce
  the risks of many security-related incidents and streamline your response processes.
  The detection searches in this Analytic Story will help you identify systems that
  have backup failures, as well as systems that have not been backed up for an extended
  period of time. The story will also return the notable event history and all of
  the backup logs for an endpoint.
