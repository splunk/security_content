description: CVE-2021-40444 is a remote code execution vulnerability in MSHTML, recently
  used to delivery targeted spearphishing documents.
narrative: "Microsoft is aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ CVE-2021-40444 by using specially-crafted Microsoft Office documents. MSHTML is\
  \ a software component used to render web pages on Windows. Although it is 2019s most\
  \ commonly associated with Internet Explorer, it is also used in other software.\
  \  CVE-2021-40444 received a CVSS score of 8.8 out of 10. MSHTML is the beating\
  \ heart of Internet Explorer, the vulnerability also exists in that browser. Although\
  \ given its limited use, there is little risk of infection by that vector. Microsoft\
  \ Office applications use the MSHTML component to display web content in Office\
  \ documents. The attack depends on MSHTML loading a specially crafted ActiveX control\
  \ when the target opens a malicious Office document. The loaded ActiveX control\
  \ can then run arbitrary code to infect the system with more malware. At the\
  \ moment all supported Windows versions are vulnerable. Since there is no patch\
  \ available yet, Microsoft proposes a few methods to block these attacks. \\\n1.\
  \ Disable the installation of all ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer via the\
  \ registry. Previously-installed ActiveX controls will still run, but no new ones\
  \ will be added, including malicious ones. Open documents from the Internet\
  \ in Protected View or Application Guard for Office, both of which prevent the current\
  \ attack. This is a default setting but it may have been changed."
