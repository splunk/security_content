narrative: The Snake implant is considered the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool designed and used by
  Center 16 of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) for long-term intelligence collection on sensitive
  targets. To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of
  numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay
  nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB's ultimate
  targets. Snake's custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for
  confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.
  We consider Snake to be the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool in the FSB's arsenal. The
  sophistication of Snake stems from three principal areas. First, Snake employs means to achieve a
  rare level of stealth in its host components and network communications. Second, Snake's internal
  technical architecture allows for easy incorporation of new or replacement components. This design
  also facilitates the development and interoperability of Snake instances running on different host
  operating systems. We have observed interoperable Snake implants for Windows, MacOS, and Linux
  operating systems. Lastly, Snake demonstrates careful software engineering design and
  implementation, with the implant containing surprisingly few bugs given its complexity. (CISA, 2023)
