description: This story is focused around detecting attacks on a DevSecOps lifeccycle which
  consists of the phases plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate and monitor.
narrative: DevSecOps is a collaborative framework, which thinks about application and infrastructure 
  security from the start. This means that security tools are part of the continuous integration and 
  continuous deployment pipeline. In this analytics story, we focused on detections around the tools
  used in this framework such as GitHub as a version control system, GDrive for the documentation, CircleCI
  as the CI/CD pipeline, Kubernetes as the container execution engine and multiple security tools such as
  Semgrep and Kube-Hunter.
