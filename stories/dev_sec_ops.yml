description: This story is focused around detecting attacks on a DevSecOps lifeccycle
  which consists of the phases plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate and
  monitor.
narrative: DevSecOps is a collaborative framework, which thinks about application
  and infrastructure security from the start. This means that security tools are part
  of the continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline. In this analytics
  story, we focused on detections around the tools used in this framework such as
  GitHub as a version control system, GDrive for the documentation, CircleCI as the
  CI/CD pipeline, Kubernetes as the container execution engine and multiple security
  tools such as Semgrep and Kube-Hunter.
