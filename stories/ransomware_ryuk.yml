  \ on October 28th called \u201CRansomware Activity Targeting the Healthcare and\
  \ Public Health Sector.\u201D This alert details TTPs associated with ongoing and\
  \ possible imminent attacks against the Healthcare sector, and is a joint advisory\
  \ in coordination with other U.S. Government agencies. The objective of these malicious\
  \ campaigns is to infiltrate targets in named sectors and to drop ransomware payloads,\
  \ which will likely cause disruption of service and increase risk of actual harm\
  \ to the health and safety of patients at hospitals, even with the aggravant of\
  \ an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This document specifically refers to several crimeware\
  \ exploitation frameworks, emphasizing the use of Ryuk ransomware as payload. The\
  \ Ryuk ransomware payload is not new. It has been well documented and identified\
  \ in multiple variants. Payloads need a carrier, and for Ryuk it has often been\
  \ exploitation frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, or popular crimeware frameworks\
  \ such as Emotet or Trickbot."
