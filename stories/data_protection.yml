narrative: Attackers can leverage a variety of resources to compromise or exfiltrate
  enterprise data. Common exfiltration techniques include remote-access channels via
  low-risk, high-payoff active-collections operations and close-access operations
  using insiders and removable media. While this Analytic Story is not a comprehensive
  listing of all the methods by which attackers can exfiltrate data, it provides a
  useful starting point.
