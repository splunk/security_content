narrative: 'It is a common practice for attackers of all types to leverage native
  Windows tools and functionality to execute commands for malicious reasons. One such
  tool on Windows OS is `netsh.exe`,a command-line scripting utility that allows you
  to--either locally or remotely--display or modify the network configuration of a
  computer that is currently running. `Netsh.exe` can be used to discover and disable
  local firewall settings. It can also be used to set up a remote connection to a
  host from an infected system.\

  To get started, run the detection search to identify parent processes of `netsh.exe`.'
