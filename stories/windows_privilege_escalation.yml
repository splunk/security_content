name: Windows Privilege Escalation
narrative: 'Privilege escalation is a "land-and-expand" technique, wherein an adversary
  gains an initial foothold on a host and then exploits its weaknesses to increase
  his privileges. The motivation is simple: certain actions on a Windows machine--such
  as installing software--may require higher-level privileges than those the attacker
  initially acquired. By increasing his privilege level, the attacker can gain the
  control required to carry out his malicious ends. This Analytic Story provides searches
  to detect and investigate behaviors that attackers may use to elevate their privileges
  in your environment.'
