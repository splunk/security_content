description: Leverage searches that allow you to detect and investigate unusual activities
  that might relate to ransomware--spikes in SMB traffic, suspicious wevtutil usage,
  the presence of common ransomware extensions, and system processes run from unexpected
  locations, and many others.
narrative: Ransomware is an ever-present risk to the enterprise, wherein an infected
  host encrypts business-critical data, holding it hostage until the victim pays the
  attacker a ransom. There are many types and varieties of ransomware that can affect
  an enterprise. Attackers can deploy ransomware to enterprises through spearphishing
  campaigns and driveby downloads, as well as through traditional remote service-based
  exploitation. In the case of the WannaCry campaign, there was self-propagating wormable
  functionality that was used to maximize infection. Fortunately, organizations can
  apply several techniques--such as those in this Analytic Story--to detect and or
  mitigate the effects of ransomware.
