description: Keep a careful inventory of every asset on your network to make it easier
  to detect rogue devices. Unauthorized/unmanaged devices could be an indication of
  malicious behavior that should be investigated further.
narrative: This Analytic Story is designed to help you develop a better understanding
  of what authorized and unauthorized devices are part of your enterprise. This story
  can help you better categorize and classify assets, providing critical business
  context and awareness of their assets during an incident. Information derived from
  this Analytic Story can be used to better inform and support other analytic stories.
  For successful detection, you will need to leverage the Assets and Identity Framework
  from Enterprise Security to populate your known assets.
