  Research Team, this vulnerability has been found to affect sudo across multiple
  Linux distributions (Ubuntu 20.04 and prior, Debian 10 and prior, Fedora 33 and
  prior). As this vulnerability was committed to code in July 2011, there will be

name: Baron Samedit CVE-2021-3156
narrative: A non-privledged user is able to execute the sudoedit command to trigger
  a buffer overflow. After the successful buffer overflow, they are then able to gain
  root privileges on the affected host. The conditions needed to be run are a trailing
  "\" along with shell and edit flags. Monitoring the /var/log directory on Linux
  hosts using the Splunk Universal Forwarder will allow you to pick up this behavior
  when using the provided detection.
