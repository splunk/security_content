description: Identify activity and techniques associated with the Evasion of
  Defenses within AWS, such as Disabling CloudTrail, Deleting CloudTrail and many others.
narrative: Adversaries employ a variety of techniques in order to avoid detection and operate
  without barriers. This often involves modifying the configuration of security monitoring tools
  to get around them or explicitly disabling them to prevent them from running. This
  Analytic Story includes analytics that identify activity consistent with adversaries
  attempting to disable various security mechanisms on AWS. Such activity may involve deleting the CloudTrail logs , 
  as this is where all the AWS logs get stored or explicitly changing the retention policy of S3 buckets.
  Other times, adversaries attempt deletion of a specified AWS CloudWatch log group.
