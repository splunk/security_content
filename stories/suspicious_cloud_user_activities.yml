name: Suspicious Cloud User Activities
narrative: 'It seems obvious that it is critical to monitor and control the users
  who have access to your cloud infrastructure. Nevertheless, it''s all too common
  for enterprises to lose track of ad-hoc accounts, leaving their servers vulnerable
  to attack. In fact, this was the very oversight that led to Tesla''s cryptojacking
  attack in February, 2018.\

  In addition to compromising the security of your data, when bad actors leverage
  your compute resources, it can incur monumental costs, since you will be billed
  for any new instances and increased bandwidth usage.'
