description: 'Uncover activity related to the execution of Zerologon CVE-2020-11472, a technique wherein
  attackers target a Microsoft Windows Domain Controller to reset its computer account password. The result from this attack
  is attackers can now provide themselves high privileges and take over Domain Controller. The included searches in this Analytic Story
  are designed to identify attempts to reset Domain Controller Computer Account via exploit code remotely or via the use of tool Mimikatz
  as payload carrier.'
narrative: 'This attack is a privilege escalation technique, where attacker targets a Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller,
  using Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC).
  This vulnerability exposes vulnerable Windows Domain Controllers to be targeted via unaunthenticated RPC calls which eventually
  reset Domain Contoller computer account ($) providing the attacker the opportunity to exfil domain controller credential secrets and
  assign themselve high privileges that can lead to domain controller and potentially complete network takeover.
  The detection searches in this Analytic Story use Windows Event viewer events and Sysmon events to detect attack execution, these
  searches monitor access to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process which is an indicator of the use of Mimikatz
  tool which has bee updated to carry this attack payload.'
