description: PetitPotam (CVE-2021-36942,) is a vulnerablity identified in Microsofts
  EFSRPC Protocol that can allow an unauthenticated account to escalate privileges
  to domain administrator given the right circumstances.
narrative: In June 2021, security researchers at SpecterOps released a blog post and
  white paper detailing several potential attack vectors against Active Directory
  Certificated Services (ADCS). ADCS is a Microsoft product that implements Public
  Key Infrastrucutre (PKI) functionality and can be used by organizations to provide
  and manage digital certiticates within Active Directory.\ In July 2021, a security
  researcher released PetitPotam, a tool that allows attackers to coerce Windows systems
  into authenticating to arbitrary endpoints.\ Combining PetitPotam with the identified
  ADCS attack vectors allows attackers to escalate privileges from an unauthenticated
  anonymous user to full domain admin privileges.
