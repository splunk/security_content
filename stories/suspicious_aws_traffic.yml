  of anomalous activity and suspicious behaviors, such as a spike in blocked outbound
  traffic in your virtual private cloud (VPC).

name: Suspicious AWS Traffic
narrative: "A virtual private cloud (VPC) is an on-demand managed cloud-computing\
  \ service that isolates computing resources for each client. Inside the VPC container,\
  \ the environment resembles a physical network. \\\nAmazon's VPC service enables\
  \ you to launch EC2 instances and leverage other Amazon resources. The traffic that\
  \ flows in and out of this VPC can be controlled via network access-control rules\
  \ and security groups. Amazon also has a feature called VPC Flow Logs that enables\
  \ you to log IP traffic going to and from the network interfaces in your VPC. This\
  \ data is stored using Amazon CloudWatch Logs.\\\n Attackers may abuse the AWS infrastructure\
  \ with insecure VPCs so they can co-opt AWS resources for command-and-control nodes,\
  \ data exfiltration, and more. Once an EC2 instance is compromised, an attacker\
  \ may initiate outbound network connections for malicious reasons. Monitoring these\
  \ network traffic behaviors is crucial for understanding the type of traffic flowing\
  \ in and out of your network and to alert you to suspicious activities.\\\nThe searches\
  \ in this Analytic Story will monitor your AWS network traffic for evidence of anomalous\
  \ activity and suspicious behaviors."
