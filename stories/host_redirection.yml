description: Detect evidence of tactics used to redirect traffic from a host to a
  destination other than the one intended--potentially one that is part of an adversary's
  attack infrastructure. An example is redirecting communications regarding patches
  and updates or misleading users into visiting a malicious website.

name: Host Redirection
narrative: Attackers will often attempt to manipulate client communications for nefarious
  purposes. In some cases, an attacker may endeavor to modify a local host file to
  redirect communications with resources (such as antivirus or system-update services)
  to prevent clients from receiving patches or updates. In other cases, an attacker
  might use this tactic to have the client connect to a site that looks like the intended
  site, but instead installs malware or collects information from the victim. Additionally,
  an attacker may redirect a victim in order to execute a MITM attack and observe
  communications.
