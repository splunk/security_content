description: Leverage searches that detect cleartext network protocols that may leak
  credentials or should otherwise be encrypted.

name: Use of Cleartext Protocols
narrative: Various legacy protocols operate by default in the clear, without the protections
  of encryption. This potentially leaks sensitive information that can be exploited
  by passively sniffing network traffic. Depending on the protocol, this information
  could be highly sensitive, or could allow for session hijacking. In addition, these
  protocols send authentication information, which would allow for the harvesting
  of usernames and passwords that could potentially be used to authenticate and compromise
  secondary systems.
