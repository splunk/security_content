name: Suspicious Okta Activity
narrative: 'Okta is the leading single sign on (SSO) provider, allowing users to authenticate
  once to Okta, and from there access a variety of web-based applications. These applications
  are assigned to users and allow administrators to centrally manage which users are
  allowed to access which applications. It also provides centralized logging to help
  understand how the applications are used and by whom. \

  While SSO is a major convenience for users, it also provides attackers with an opportunity.
  If the attacker can gain access to Okta, they can access a variety of applications.
  As such monitoring the environment is important. \

  With people moving quickly to adopt web-based applications and ways to manage them,
  many are still struggling to understand how best to monitor these environments.
  This analytic story provides searches to help monitor this environment, and identify
  events and activity that warrant further investigation such as credential stuffing
  or password spraying attacks, and users logging in from multiple locations when
  travel is disallowed.'
