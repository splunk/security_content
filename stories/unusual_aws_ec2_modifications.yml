narrative: "A common attack technique is to infiltrate a cloud instance and make modifications.\
  \ The adversary can then secure access to your infrastructure or hide their activities.\
  \ So it's important to stay alert to changes that may indicate that your environment\
  \ has been compromised. \\\n Searches within this Analytic Story can help you detect\
  \ the presence of a threat by monitoring for EC2 instances that have been created\
  \ or changed--either by users that have never previously performed these activities\
  \ or by known users who modify or create instances in a way that have not been done\
  \ before. This story also provides investigative searches that help you go deeper\
  \ once you detect suspicious behavior."
