description: Windows services are often used by attackers for persistence, privilege escalation,  
  lateral movement, defense evasion, collection of data, a tool for recon, credential dumping and 
  payload impact. This Analytic Story helps you monitor your environment for indications 
  that Windows registry are being modified or created in a suspicious manner.
narrative: Windows Registry is one of the powerful and yet still mysterious Windows features 
  that can tweak or manipulate Windows policies and low-level configuration settings. 
  Because of this capability,  most malware, adversaries or threat actors abuse this 
  hierarchical database to do their malicious intent on a targeted host or network environment. 
  In these cases, attackers often use tools to create or modify registry in ways that are not 
  typical for most environments, providing opportunities for detection.
