description: Monitor and detect behaviors used by attackers who leverage trusted developer utilities
  to execute malicious code.
narrative: 'Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy
  execution of malicious payloads. There are many utilities used for software development
  related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development,
  debugging, and reverse engineering. These utilities may often be signed with
  legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of
  malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.\

  The searches in this story help you detect and investigate suspicious activity that
  may indicate that an adversary is leveraging microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe to execute 
  malicious code.'
