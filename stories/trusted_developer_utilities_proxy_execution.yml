name: Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution
narrative: 'Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy
  execution of malicious payloads. There are many utilities used for software development
  related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development,
  debugging, and reverse engineering. These utilities may often be signed with legitimate
  certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious
  code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.\

  The searches in this story help you detect and investigate suspicious activity that
  may indicate that an adversary is leveraging microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe to
  execute malicious code.'
