narrative: BlackByte ransomware campaigns targeting business operations, 
  involve the use of ransomware payloads, infection chain to collect and exfiltrate data and drop payload on the targeted system. 
  BlackByte Ransomware operates by infiltrating a system through various methods, such as malicious email attachments, exploit kits, 
  or compromised websites. Once inside a system, it begins encrypting files using strong encryption algorithms, rendering them unusable. 
  After completing the encryption process, BlackByte Ransomware typically leaves a ransom note that explains the situation to the victim 
  and provides instructions on how to pay the ransom to obtain the decryption key.
