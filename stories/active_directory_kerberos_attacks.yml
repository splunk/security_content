description: Monitor for activities and techniques associated with Kerberos based attacks within with Active Directory environments.
narrative: Kerberos, initially named after Cerberus, the three-headed dog in Greek mythology, is a network authentication protocol that allows computers and
 users to prove their identity through a trusted third-party. This trusted third-party issues Kerberos tickets using symmetric encryption to allow users access
 to services and network resources based on their privilege level. Kerberos is the default authentication protocol used on Windows Active Directory networks since
 the introduction of Windows Server 2003. With Kerberos being the backbone of Windows authentication, it is commonly abused by adversaries across the different phases 
 of a breach including initial access, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, lateral movement, etc.\
 This Analytic Story groups detection use cases in which the Kerberos protocol is abused. Defenders can leverage these analytics to detect and hunt for adversaries engaging in 
 Kerberos based attacks.
