name: Monitor for Updates
narrative: 'It is a common best practice to ensure that endpoints are being patched
  and updated in a timely manner, in order to reduce the risk of compromise via a
  publicly disclosed vulnerability. Timely application of updates/patches is important
  to eliminate known vulnerabilities that may be exploited by various threat actors.\

  Searches in this analytic story are designed to help analysts monitor endpoints
  for system patches and/or updates. This helps analysts identify any systems that
  are not successfully updated in a timely matter.\

  Microsoft releases updates for Windows systems on a monthly cadence. They should
  be installed as soon as possible after following internal testing and validation
  procedures. Patches and updates for other systems or applications are typically
  released as needed.'
