narrative: 'The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) defines Internet fraud as the
  use of Internet services or software with Internet access to defraud victims or
  to otherwise take advantage of them. According to the Bureau, Internet crime schemes
  are used to steal millions of dollars each year from victims and continue to plague
  the Internet through various methods. The agency includes phishing scams, data breaches,
  Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, email account compromise, malware, spoofing, and
  ransomware in this category.\

  These crimes are not the fraud itself, but rather the attack techniques commonly
  employed by fraudsters in their pursuit of data that enables them to commit malicious
  actssuch as obtaining and using stolen credit cards. They represent a serious problem
  that is steadily increasing and not likely to go away anytime soon.\

  When developing a strategy for preventing fraud in your environment, its important
  to  look across all of your web services for evidence that attackers are abusing
  enterprise resources to enumerate systems, harvest data for secondary fraudulent
  activity, or abuse terms of service.This Analytic Story looks for evidence of common
  Internet attack techniques that could be indicative of web fraud in your environmentincluding
  account harvesting, anomalous user clickspeed, and password sharing across accounts,
  to name just a few.\

  The account-harvesting search focuses on web pages used for user-account registration.
  It detects the creation of a large number of user accounts using the same email
  domain name, a type of activity frequently seen in advance of a fraud campaign.\

  The anomalous clickspeed search looks for users who are moving through your website
  at a faster-than-normal speed or with a perfect click cadence (high periodicity
  or low standard deviation), which could indicate that the user is a script, not
  an actual human.\

  Another search detects incidents wherein a single password is used across multiple
  accounts, which may indicate that a fraudster has infiltrated your environment and
  embedded a common password within a script.'
