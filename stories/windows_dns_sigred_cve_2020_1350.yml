name: Windows DNS SIGRed CVE-2020-1350
id: 36dbb206-d073-11ea-87d0-0242ac130003
version: 1

description: Uncover activity consistent with CVE-2020-1350, or SIGRed.
  Discovered by Checkpoint researchers, this vulnerability affects Windows 2003
  to 2019, and is triggered by a malicious DNS response (only affects DNS over TCP).
  An attacker can use the malicious payload to cause a buffer overflow on the vulnerable
  system, leading to compromise.  The included searches in this Analytic Story
  are designed to identify the large response payload for SIG and KEY DNS records which can
  be used for the exploit.
narrative: 'When a client requests a DNS record for a particular domain, that request
  gets routed first through the client''s locally configured DNS server, then to any DNS server(s)
  configured as forwarders, and then onto the target domain''s own DNS server(s).  If a
  attacker wanted to, they could host a malicious DNS server that responds to the initial
  request with a specially crafted large response (~65KB).  This response would flow through
  to the client''s local DNS server, which if not patched for CVE-2020-1350, would cause the buffer
  overflow.
  The detection searches in this Analytic Story use wire data to detect the malicious behavior.
  Searches for Splunk Stream and Zeek are included.  The Splunk Stream search correlates
  across stream:dns and stream:tcp, while the Zeek search correlates across bro:dns:json
  and bro:conn:json.  These correlations are required to pick up both the DNS record types
  (SIG and KEY) along with the payload size (>65KB).'
