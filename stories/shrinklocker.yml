description: ShrinkLocker is a new ransomware that uses Windows BitLocker to encrypt files by creating new boot partitions. 
  It targets non-boot partitions, shrinks them, and creates new boot volumes. ShrinkLocker has attacked a government entity and 
  companies in the vaccine and manufacturing sectors. The ransomware doesn't drop a ransom note but uses the boot partition label 
  to provide contact emails for the attackers. Kaspersky researchers emphasize secure recovery key storage and offline backups to mitigate such threats.
