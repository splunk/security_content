  and Traffix SDC devices (vulnerable versions in F5 support link below).

  to the configuration utility to execute system commands, create/delete files, disable services,
  and/or execute Java code.  This vulnerability can result in full system compromise.
narrative: 'A client is able to perform a remote code execution on an exposed and vulnerable system.
  The detection search in this Analytic Story uses syslog to detect the malicious behavior.
  Syslog is going to be the best detection method, as any systems using SSL to protect their management
  console will make detection via wire data difficult.  The searches included used Splunk Connect For
  Syslog (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4740/), and used a custom destination port to help define
  the data as F5 data (covered in https://splunk-connect-for-syslog.readthedocs.io/en/master/sources/F5/)'
