  that might relate to the Chaos ransomware, including looking for file writes (file encryption and ransomware notes), 
  deleting shadow volume storage, registry key modification, dropping of files in startup folder, and more.
narrative: CHAOS ransomware has been seen and monitored since 2021. This ransomware is purportedly a .NET version of Ryuk ransomware 
  but upon closer look to its code and behavior, this malware sample reveals that it doesn't share much relation to the notorious RYUK 
  ransomware. This ransomware is one of the known ransomware that was used in the ongoing geo-political war. 
  This ransomware is capable to check that only one copy of itself is running on the targeted host, delay of execution as part of its 
  defense evasion technique, persistence through registry and startup folder, drop a copy of itself in each root drive of the targeted host and also in 
  %appdata% folder and many more. As of writing this ransomware is still active and keeps on infecting Windows Operating machines and Windows networks.
