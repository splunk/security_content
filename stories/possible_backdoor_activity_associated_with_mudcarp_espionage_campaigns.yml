  employed by the MUDCARP threat group.

narrative: 'This story was created as a joint effort between iDefense and Splunk.\

  iDefense analysts have recently discovered a Windows executable file that, upon
  execution, spoofs a decryption tool and then drops a file that appears to be the
  custom-built javascript backdoor, "Orz," which is associated with the threat actors
  known as MUDCARP (as well as "temp.Periscope" and "Leviathan"). The file is executed
  using Wscript.\

  The MUDCARP techniques include the use of the compressed-folders module from Microsoft,
  zipfldr.dll, with RouteTheCall export to run the malicious process or command. After
  a successful reboot, the malware is made persistent by a manipulating `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]''help''=''c:\\windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe
  c:\\windows\\system32\\zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall c:\\programdata\\winapp.exe''`.
  Though this technique is not exclusive to MUDCARP, it has been spotted in the group''s
  arsenal of advanced techniques seen in the wild.\

  This Analytic Story searches for evidence of tactics, techniques, and procedures
  (TTPs) that allow for the use of a endpoint detection-and-response (EDR) bypass
  technique to mask the true parent of a malicious process. It can also be set as
  a registry key for further sandbox evasion and to allow the malware to launch only
  after reboot.\

  If behavioral searches included in this story yield positive hits, iDefense recommends
  conducting IOC searches for the following:\
