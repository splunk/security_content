name: Suspicious DNS Traffic
narrative: Although DNS is one of the fundamental underlying protocols that make the
  Internet work, it is often ignored (perhaps because of its complexity and effectiveness).  However,
  attackers have discovered ways to abuse the protocol to meet their objectives. One
  potential abuse involves manipulating DNS to hijack traffic and redirect it to an
  IP address under the attacker's control. This could inadvertently send users intending
  to visit google.com, for example, to an unrelated malicious website. Another technique
  involves using the DNS protocol for command-and-control activities with the attacker's
  malicious code or to covertly exfiltrate data. The searches within this Analytic
  Story look for these types of abuses.
