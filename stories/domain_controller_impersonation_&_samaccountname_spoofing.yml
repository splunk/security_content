description: Monitor for activities and techniques associated with the exploitation of the sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) 
  and Domain Controller Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287) vulnerabilities.
narrative: On November 9, 2021, Microsoft released patches to address two vulnerabilities that affect Windows Active Directory networks, 
  sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287). On December 10, 2021, security researchers Charlie Clark and
  Andrew Schwartz released a blog post where they shared how to weaponise these vulnerabilities in a target network an the initial detection opportunities. When successfully exploited, 
  CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 allow an adversary, who has stolen the credentials of a low priviled domain user, to obtain a Kerberos Service ticket for a 
  Domain Controller computer account. The only requirement is to have network connectivity to a domain controller. 
  This attack vector effectivelly allows attackers to escalate their privileges in an Active Directory from a regular domain user account 
  and take control of a domain controller. While patches have been released to address these vulnerabilities, deploying detection controls for this attack may help
  help defenders identify attackers attempting exploitation.
