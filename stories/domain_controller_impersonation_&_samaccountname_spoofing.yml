description: Monitor for activities and techniques associated with the exploitation
  of the sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller Impersonation
  (CVE-2021-42287) vulnerabilities.
narrative: On November 9, 2021, Microsoft released patches to address two vulnerabilities
  that affect Windows Active Directory networks, sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278)
  and Domain Controller Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287). On December 10, 2021, security
  researchers Charlie Clark and Andrew Schwartz released a blog post where they shared
  how to weaponise these vulnerabilities in a target network an the initial detection
  opportunities. When successfully exploited, CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 allow
  an adversary, who has stolen the credentials of a low priviled domain user, to obtain
  a Kerberos Service ticket for a Domain Controller computer account. The only requirement
  is to have network connectivity to a domain controller. This attack vector effectivelly
  allows attackers to escalate their privileges in an Active Directory from a regular
  domain user account and take control of a domain controller. While patches have
  been released to address these vulnerabilities, deploying detection controls for
  this attack may help help defenders identify attackers attempting exploitation.
