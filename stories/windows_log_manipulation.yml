name: Windows Log Manipulation
narrative: 'Because attackers often modify system logs to cover their tracks and/or
  to thwart the investigative process, log monitoring is an industry-recognized best
  practice. While there are legitimate reasons to manipulate system logs, it is still
  worthwhile to keep track of who manipulated the logs, when they manipulated them,
  and in what way they manipulated them (determining which accesses, tools, or utilities
  were employed). Even if no malicious activity is detected, the knowledge of an attempt
  to manipulate system logs may be indicative of a broader security risk that should
  be thoroughly investigated.\

  The Analytic Story gives users two different ways to detect manipulation of Windows
  Event Logs and one way to detect deletion of the Update Sequence Number (USN) Change
  Journal. The story helps determine the history of the host and the users who have
  accessed it. Finally, the story aides in investigation by retrieving all the information
  on the process that caused these events (if the process has been identified).'
