name: Suspicious GCP Storage Activities
narrative: Similar to other cloud providers, GCP operates on a shared responsibility
  model. This means the end user, you, are responsible for setting appropriate access
  control lists and permissions on your GCP resources.\ This Analytics Story concentrates
  on detecting things like open storage buckets (both read and write) along with storage
  bucket access from unfamiliar users and IP addresses.
