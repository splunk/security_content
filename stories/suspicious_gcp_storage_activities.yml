description: Use the searches in this Analytic Story to monitor your GCP Storage buckets
  for evidence of anomalous activity and suspicious behaviors, such as detecting open
  storage buckets and buckets being accessed from a new IP. The contextual and investigative
  searches will give you more information, when required.
narrative: 'Similar to other cloud providers, GCP operates on a shared responsibility model.
  This means the end user, you, are responsible for setting appropriate access control lists
  and permissions on your GCP resources.\
  This Analytics Story concentrates on detecting things like open storage buckets (both read and write)
  along with storage bucket access from unfamiliar users and IP addresses.'
