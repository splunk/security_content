id: 1fc34cbc-34e9-43ba-87ab-6811c9e95400
name: Splunk Enterprise Vulnerability CVE-2018-11409
narrative: 'Although there have been no reports of it being exploited, Splunk Enterprise
  versions through 7.0.1 reportedly have a vulnerability that may expose information
  through a REST endpoint (read more here: https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAP5E#VulnerabilityDescriptionsandRatings).
  NIST has included it in its vulnerability database (read more here: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11409).
  The REST endpoint that exposes system information is also necessary for the proper
  operation of Splunk clustering and instrumentation. Customers should upgrade to
  the latest version to reduce the risk of this vulnerability.\

  Splunk Enterprise exposes partial information about the host operating system, hardware,
  and Splunk license. Splunk Enterprise before 6.6.0 exposes this information without
  authentication. Splunk Enterprise 6.6.0 and later exposes this information only
  to authenticated Splunk users. Based on the information exposure, Splunk characterizes
  this issue as a low severity impact.\
