  file associations. Some of the malicious behaviors involved may include inserting
  spaces before file extensions or prepending the file extension with a different
  one, among other techniques.

name: Windows File Extension and Association Abuse
narrative: "Attackers use a variety of techniques to entice users to run malicious\
  \ code or to persist on an endpoint. One way to accomplish these goals is to leverage\
  \ file extensions and the mechanism Windows uses to associate files with specific\
  \ applications. \\\n Since its earliest days, Windows has used extensions to identify\
  \ file types. Users have become familiar with these extensions and their application\
  \ associations. For example, if users see that a file ends in `.doc` or `.docx`,\
  \ they will assume that it is a Microsoft Word document and expect that double-clicking\
  \ will open it using `winword.exe`. The user will typically also presume that the\
  \ `.docx` file is safe. \\\n Attackers take advantage of this expectation by obfuscating\
  \ the true file extension. They can accomplish this in a couple of ways. One technique\
  \ involves inserting multiple spaces in the file name before the extension to hide\
  \ the extension from the GUI, obscuring the true nature of the file. Another approach\
  \ involves prepending the real extension with a different one. This is especially\
  \ effective when Windows is configured to \"hide extensions for known file types.\"\
  \ In this case, the real extension is not displayed, but the prepended one is, leading\
  \ end users to believe the file is a different type than it actually is.\\\nChanging\
  \ the association between a file extension and an application can allow an attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary code. The technique typically involves changing the association\
  \ for an often-launched file type to associate instead with a malicious program\
  \ the attacker has dropped on the endpoint. When the end user launches a file that\
  \ has been manipulated in this way, it will execute the attacker's malware. It will\
  \ also execute the application the end user expected to run, cleverly obscuring\
  \ the fact that something suspicious has occurred.\\\nRun the searches in this story\
  \ to detect and investigate suspicious behavior that may indicate abuse or manipulation\
  \ of Windows file extensions and/or associations."
