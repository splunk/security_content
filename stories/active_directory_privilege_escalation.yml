description: Monitor for activities and techniques associated with Privilege Escalation
  attacks within Active Directory environments.
narrative: Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. 
  Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. 
  Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.\

  Active Directory is a central component of most enterprise networks, providing authentication and authorization services for users, computers, and other resources.
  It stores sensitive information such as passwords, user accounts, and security policies, and is therefore a high-value target for attackers.
  Privilege escalation attacks in Active Directory typically involve exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations across the network to gain elevated privileges,
  such as Domain Administrator access. Once an attacker has escalated their privileges and taken full control of a domain, they can easily move laterally throughout the network, 
  access sensitive data, and carry out further attacks. Security teams should monitor for privilege escalation attacks in Active Directory to identify a breach before attackers achieve operational success.\
   
  The following analytic story groups detection opportunities that seek to identify an adversary attempting to escalate privileges in an Active Directory network.
