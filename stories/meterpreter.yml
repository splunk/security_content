description: Meterpreter provides red teams, pen testers and threat actors interactive
  access to a compromised host to run commands, upload payloads, download files, and
  other actions.
narrative: 'This Analytic Story supports you to detect Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
  (TTPs) from Meterpreter. Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload for remote execution
  that leverages DLL injection to make it extremely difficult to detect.  Since the
  software runs in memory, no new processes are created upon injection.  It also leverages
  encrypted communication channels.\

  Meterpreter enables the operator to remotely run commands on the target machine,
  upload payloads, download files, dump password hashes, and much more.  It is difficult
  to determine from the forensic evidence what actions the operator performed.  Splunk
  Research, however, has observed anomalous behaviors on the compromised hosts that
  seem to only appear when Meterpreter is executing various commands.  With that,
  we have written new detections targeted to these detections.\

  While investigating a detection related to this analytic story, please bear in mind
  that the detections look for anomalies in system behavior.  It will be imperative
  to look for other signs in the endpoint and network logs for lateral movement, discovery
  and other actions to confirm that the host was compromised and a remote actor used
  it to progress on their objectives.'
