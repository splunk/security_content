description: Meterpreter provides red teams, pen testers and threat actors interactive access to a compromised host to run commands, upload payloads, download files, and other actions.
narrative: 'This Analytic Story supports you to detect Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) from Meterpreter.
  Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload for remote execution that leverages DLL injection to make it extremely difficult to detect.  Since the software
  runs in memory, no new processes are created upon injection.  It also leverages encrypted communication channels.\

  Meterpreter enables the operator to remotely run commands on the target machine, upload payloads, download files, dump password hashes,
  and much more.  It is difficult to determine from the forensic evidence what actions the operator performed.  Splunk Research, however, has observed
  anomalous behaviors on the compromised hosts that seem to only appear when Meterpreter is executing various commands.  With that, we have written new
  detections targeted to these detections.\

  While investigating a detection related to this analytic story, please bear in mind that the detections look for anomalies in system behavior.  It will be
  imperative to look for other signs in the endpoint and network logs for lateral movement, discovery and other actions to confirm that the host was compromised
  and a remote actor used it to progress on their objectives.'
