description: Monitors for behaviors associated with adversaries discovering objects in the
  environment that can be leveraged in the progression of the attack.
narrative: Attackers may not have much if any insight into their target's environment
  before the initial compromise.  Once a foothold has been established, attackers will
  start enumerating objects in the environment (accounts, services, network shares, etc.)
  that can be used to achieve their objectives.  This Analytic Story provides searches to
  help identify activities consistent with adversaries gaining knowledge of compromised
  Windows environments.
