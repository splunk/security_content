description: Monitors for behaviors associated with adversaries discovering objects
  in the environment that can be leveraged in the progression of the attack.
narrative: Attackers may not have much if any insight into their target's environment
  before the initial compromise.  Once a foothold has been established, attackers
  will start enumerating objects in the environment (accounts, services, network shares,
  etc.) that can be used to achieve their objectives.  This Analytic Story provides
  searches to help identify activities consistent with adversaries gaining knowledge
  of compromised Windows environments.
