Fortunately, there are a number of ways to monitor email data in Splunk to detect suspicious content.<br></br>Once a phishing message has been detected, the next steps are to answer the following questions: <ul><li>Which users have received this or a similar message in the past?</li><li>When did the targeted campaign begin?</li><li>Have any users interacted with the content of the messages (by downloading an attachment or clicking on a malicious URL)?</li></ul>This Analytic Story provides detection searches to identify suspicious emails, as well as contextual and investigative searches to help answer some of these questions.",
