  that only authorized users and systems are accessing critical assets. Core routing
  and switching infrastructure are common strategic targets for attackers.

name: Router and Infrastructure Security
narrative: 'Networking devices, such as routers and switches, are often overlooked
  as resources that attackers will leverage to subvert an enterprise. Advanced threats
  actors have shown a proclivity to target these critical assets as a means to siphon
  and redirect network traffic, flash backdoored operating systems, and implement
  cryptographic weakened algorithms to more easily decrypt network traffic.\

  This Analytic Story helps you gain a better understanding of how your network devices
  are interacting with your hosts. By compromising your network devices, attackers
  can obtain direct access to the company''s internal infrastructure&#151; effectively
  increasing the attack surface and accessing private services/data.'
