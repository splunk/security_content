name: Suspicious Windows Registry Activities
narrative: "Attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated techniques for hijacking\
  \ target servers, while evading detection. One such technique that has become progressively\
  \ more common is registry modification.\\\n The registry is a key component of the\
  \ Windows operating system. It has a hierarchical database called \"registry\" that\
  \ contains settings, options, and values for executables. Once the threat actor\
  \ gains access to a machine, they can use reg.exe to modify their account to obtain\
  \ administrator-level privileges, maintain persistence, and move laterally within\
  \ the environment.\\\n The searches in this story are designed to help you detect\
  \ behaviors associated with manipulation of the Windows registry."
