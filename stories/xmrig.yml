description: Leverage searches that allow you to detect and investigate unusual activities
  that might relate to the xmrig monero, including looking for file writes associated
  with its payload, process command-line, defense evasion (killing services, deleting users, modifying files or folder permission, killing other malware or other coin miner)
  and hacking tools including Telegram as mean of command and control (C2) to download other files.
  Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems in order to solve resource intensive problems which may impact system and/or hosted service availability.
  One common purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency. 
  Adversaries may consume enough system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive.
  (1) Servers and cloud-based
  (2) systems are common targets because of the high potential for available resources, 
  but user endpoint systems may also be compromised and used for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining.
narrative: XMRig is a high performance, open source, cross platform RandomX, KawPow, CryptoNight and AstroBWT unified CPU/GPU miner.
  This monero is seen in the wild on May 2017.
