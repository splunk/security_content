description: Leverage searches that allow you to detect and investigate unusual activities
  that might relate to the xmrig monero, including looking for file writes associated
  with its payload, process command-line, defense evasion (killing services, deleting
  users, modifying files or folder permission, killing other malware or other coin
  miner) and hacking tools including Telegram as mean of command and control (C2)
  to download other files. Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems
  in order to solve resource intensive problems which may impact system and/or hosted
  service availability. One common purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions
  of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency. Adversaries may consume enough
  system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive.
  (1) Servers and cloud-based (2) systems are common targets because of the high potential
  for available resources, but user endpoint systems may also be compromised and used
  for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining.
narrative: XMRig is a high performance, open source, cross platform RandomX, KawPow,
  CryptoNight and AstroBWT unified CPU/GPU miner. This monero is seen in the wild
  on May 2017.
