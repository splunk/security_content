narrative: 'Zoom is a leader in modern enterprise video communications and its usage
  has increased dramatically with a large amount of the population under stay-at-home
  orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With increased usage has come increased scrutiny
  and several security flaws have been found with this application on both Windows
  and macOS systems.\

  Current detections focus on finding new child processes of this application on a
  per host basis. Investigative searches are included to gather information needed
  during an investigation.'
