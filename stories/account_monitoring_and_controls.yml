description: A common attack technique is to leverage user accounts to gain unauthorized
  access to the target's network. This Analytic Story minimizes opportunities for
  attack by helping you actively manage creation/use/dormancy/deletion--the lifecycle
  of system and application accounts.
narrative: Monitoring user accounts within your enterprise is a critical analytic
  function that helps ensure that credential and access policies/procedures are properly
  implemented and are being enforced. Proactive ad-hoc hunting, as well as routine
  monitoring, can ensure user or system accounts are not being abused by unauthorized
  individuals or processes. In the event of a network event or breach, user-authentication
  logs are a key resource in determining if or how an account might have been compromised
  or co-opted, leading to suspicious or malicious activity.
