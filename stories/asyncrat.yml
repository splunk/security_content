  that might relate to the AsyncRAT malware including mshta application child process, bat loader execution, persistence and many more.
  AsyncRAT is an open source remote administration tool released last 2019. It's designed to remotely control computers via an encrypted 
  connection, with view screen, keylogger, chat communication, persistence, defense evasion (e.g. Windows defender), DOS attack and many more.
narrative: although this project contains legal disclaimer, Adversaries or threat actors are popularly used in some attacks. This malware recently 
  came across a Fully undetected batch script loader that downloads and loads the AsyncRAT from its C2 server. 
  The batch script is obfuscated and will load a powershell loader that will decode and decrypt (AES256) the actual AsyncRAT malware.
