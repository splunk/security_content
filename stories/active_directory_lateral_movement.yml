description: Detect and investigate tactics, techniques, and procedures around how
  attackers move laterally within an Active Directory environment. Since lateral movement
  is often a necessary step in a breach, it is important for cyber defenders to deploy
  detection coverage.
narrative: "Once attackers gain a foothold within an enterprise, they will seek to\
  \ expand their accesses and leverage techniques that facilitate lateral movement.\
  \ Attackers will often spend quite a bit of time and effort moving laterally. Because\
  \ lateral movement renders an attacker the most vulnerable to detection, it's an\
  \ excellent focus for detection and investigation.\\\nIndications of lateral movement\
  \ in an Active Directory network can include the abuse of system utilities (such\
  \ as `psexec.exe`), unauthorized use of remote desktop services, `file/admin$` shares,\
  \ WMI, PowerShell, Service Control Manager, the DCOM protocol, WinRM or the abuse\
  \ of scheduled tasks. Organizations must be extra vigilant in detecting lateral\
  \ movement techniques and look for suspicious activity in and around high-value\
  \ strategic network assets, such as Active Directory, which are often considered\
  \ the primary target or \"crown jewels\" to a persistent threat actor.\\\nAn adversary\
  \ can use lateral movement for multiple purposes, including remote execution of\
  \ tools, pivoting to additional systems, obtaining access to specific information\
  \ or files, access to additional credentials, exfiltrating data, or delivering a\
  \ secondary effect. Adversaries may use legitimate credentials alongside inherent\
  \ network and operating-system functionality to remotely connect to other systems\
  \ and remain under the radar of network defenders.\\\nIf there is evidence of lateral\
  \ movement, it is imperative for analysts to collect evidence of the associated\
  \ offending hosts. For example, an attacker might leverage host A to gain access\
  \ to host B. From there, the attacker may try to move laterally to host C. In this\
  \ example, the analyst should gather as much information as possible from all three\
  \ hosts. \\\n It is also important to collect authentication logs for each host,\
  \ to ensure that the offending accounts are well-documented. Analysts should account\
  \ for all processes to ensure that the attackers did not install unauthorized software."
