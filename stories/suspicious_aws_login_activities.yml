name: Suspicious AWS Login Activities
narrative: It is important to monitor and control who has access to your AWS infrastructure.
  Detecting suspicious logins to your AWS infrastructure will provide good starting
  points for investigations. Abusive behaviors caused by compromised credentials can
  lead to direct monetary costs, as you will be billed for any EC2 instances created
  by the attacker.
