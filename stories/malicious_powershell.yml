description: Attackers are finding stealthy ways "live off the land," leveraging utilities
  and tools that come standard on the endpoint--such as PowerShell--to achieve their
  goals without downloading binary files. These searches can help you detect and investigate
  PowerShell command-line options that may be indicative of malicious intent.

narrative: 'The searches in this Analytic Story monitor for parameters often used
  for malicious purposes. It is helpful to understand how often the notable events
  generated by this story occur, as well as the commonalities between some of these
  events. These factors may provide clues about whether this is a common occurrence
  of minimal concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation.
  Likewise, it is important to determine whether the issue is restricted to a single
  user/system or is broader in scope.\

  The following factors may assist you in determining whether the event is malicious:
  \

  1. Country of origin\

  1. Responsible party\

  1. Fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address\

  1. Registration of fully qualified domain names associated with external IP addressDetermining
  whether it is a dynamic domain frequently visited by others and/or how third parties
  categorize it can also help you answer some questions surrounding the attacker and
  details related to the external system. In addition, there are various sources--such
  as VirusTotal&#151; that can provide some reputation information on the IP address
  or domain name, which can assist in determining whether the event is malicious.
  Finally, determining whether there are other events associated with the IP address
  may help connect data points or show other events that should be brought into scope.\

  Gathering data on the system of interest can sometimes help you quickly determine
  whether something suspicious is happening. Some of these items include finding out
  who else may have recently logged into the system, whether any unusual scheduled
  tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there
  are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and whether there are any known vulnerabilities
  on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen
  in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been
  targeted.\

  Often, a simple inspection of the process name and path can tell you if the system
  has been compromised. For example, if `svchost.exe` is found running from a location
  other than `C:\Windows\System32`, it is likely something malicious designed to hide
  in plain sight when cursorily reviewing process names. Similarly, if the process
  itself seems legitimate, but the parent process is running from the temporary browser
  cache, that could be indicative of activity initiated via a compromised website
  a user visited.\

  It can also be very helpful to examine various behaviors of the process of interest
  or the parent of the process of interest. For example, if it turns out the process
  of interest is malicious, it would be good to see if the parent to that process
  spawned other processes that might be worth further scrutiny. If a process is suspect,
  a review of the network connections made in and around the time of the event and/or
  whether the process spawned any child processes could be helpful, as well.\

  In the event a system is suspected of having been compromised via a malicious website,
  we suggest reviewing the browsing activity from that system around the time of the
  event. If categories are given for the URLs visited, that can help you zero in on
  possible malicious sites.'
