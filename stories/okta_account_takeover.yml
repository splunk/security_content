narrative: Okta is a cloud-based identity management service that provides organizations with a secure way to manage user access to various applications and services. It enables single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), lifecycle management, and more, helping organizations streamline the user authentication process. Account Takeover (ATO) is an attack whereby cybercriminals gain unauthorized access to online accounts by using different techniques like brute force, social engineering, phishing & spear phishing, credential stuffing, etc. By posing as the real user, cyber-criminals can change account details, send out phishing emails, access sensitive applications, or use any stolen information to access further accounts within the organization. This analytic story groups detections that can help security operations teams identify the potential compromise of Okta accounts.
