description: Monitor and detect techniques used by attackers who leverage the regsvr32.exe
  process to execute malicious code.
narrative: One common adversary tactic is to bypass application control solutions
  via the regsvr32.exe process. This particular bypass was popularized with "SquiblyDoo"
  using the "scrobj.dll" dll to load .sct scriptlets. This technique is still widely
  used by adversaries to bypass detection and prevention controls. The file extension
  of the DLL is irrelevant (it may load a .txt file extension for example). The searches
  in this story help you detect and investigate suspicious activity that may indicate
  that an adversary is leveraging regsvr32.exe to execute malicious code. Validate
  execution Determine if regsvr32.exe executed. Validate the OriginalFileName of regsvr32.exe
  and further PE metadata. If executed outside of c:\windows\system32 or c:\windows\syswow64,
  it should be highly suspect. Determine if script code was executed with regsvr32.
  Situational Awareness - The objective of this step is meant to identify suspicious
  behavioral indicators related to executed of Script code by regsvr32.exe. Parent
  process. Is the parent process a known LOLBin? Is the parent process an Office Application?
  Module loads.  Is regsvr32 loading any suspicious .DLLs? Unsigned or signed from
  non-standard paths. Network connections. Any network connections? Review the reputation
  of the remote IP or domain. Retrieval of Script Code - confirm the executed script
  code is benign or malicious.
