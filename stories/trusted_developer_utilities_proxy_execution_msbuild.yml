description: Monitor and detect techniques used by attackers who leverage the msbuild.exe
  process to execute malicious code.
narrative: 'Adversaries may use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted
  Windows utility. MSBuild.exe (Microsoft Build Engine) is a software build platform
  used by Visual Studio and is native to Windows. It handles XML formatted project
  files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.\

  The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version 4 allows
  for C# code to be inserted into an XML project file. MSBuild will compile and execute
  the inline task. MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this
  way it can execute arbitrary code and bypass application control defenses that are
  configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution.\

  The searches in this story help you detect and investigate suspicious activity that
  may indicate that an adversary is leveraging msbuild.exe to execute malicious code.\

  Triage\

  Validate execution\

  1. Determine if MSBuild.exe executed. Validate the OriginalFileName of MSBuild.exe
  and further PE metadata.\

  1. Determine if script code was executed with MSBuild.\

  Situational Awareness\

  The objective of this step is meant to identify suspicious behavioral indicators
  related to executed of Script code by MSBuild.exe.\

  1. Parent process. Is the parent process a known LOLBin? Is the parent process an
  Office Application?\

  1. Module loads. Are the known MSBuild.exe modules being loaded by a non-standard
  application? Is MSbuild loading any suspicious .DLLs?\

  1. Network connections. Any network connections? Review the reputation of the remote
  IP or domain.\

  Retrieval of script code\

  The objective of this step is to confirm the executed script code is benign or malicious.'
