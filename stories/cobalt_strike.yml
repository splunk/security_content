description: Cobalt Strike is threat emulation software. Red teams and penetration testers use Cobalt Strike to demonstrate the risk of a breach and evaluate mature security programs. Most recently, Cobalt Strike has become the choice tool by threat groups due to its ease of use and extensibility. 
narrative: 'This Analytic Story supports you to detect Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
  (TTPs) from Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike has many ways to be enhanced by using aggressor scripts, malleable C2 profiles, default attack packages, and much more. 
  For endpoint behavior, Cobalt Strike is most commonly identified via named pipes, spawn to processes, and DLL function names. 
  On the network, depending on the malleable C2 profile used, it is near infinite in the amount of ways to conceal the C2 traffic with Cobalt Strike.\

  In generating content for Cobalt Strike, the following is considered:\

  1. Is it normal for <spawn_to value> to have no command line arguments? No command line arguments and a network connection?\

  1. What is the default, or normal, process lineage for <spawn_to value>?\

  1. Does the <spawn_to value> make network connections?\

  1. Is it normal for <spawn_to value> to load jscript, vbscript, Amsi.dll, and clr.dll?.'
