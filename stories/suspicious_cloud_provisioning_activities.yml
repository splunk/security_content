description: Monitor your cloud infrastructure provisioning activities for behaviors
  originating from unfamiliar or unusual locations. These behaviors may indicate that
  malicious activities are occurring somewhere within your cloud environment.
narrative: 'Because most enterprise cloud infrastructure activities originate from
  familiar geographic locations, monitoring for activity from unknown or unusual regions
  is an important security measure. This indicator can be especially useful in environments
  where it is impossible to add specific IPs to an allow list because they vary.\

  This Analytic Story was designed to provide you with flexibility in the precision
  you employ in specifying legitimate geographic regions. It can be as specific as
  an IP address or a city, or as broad as a region (think state) or an entire country.
  By determining how precise you want your geographical locations to be and monitoring
  for new locations that haven''t previously accessed your environment, you can detect
  adversaries as they begin to probe your environment. Since there are legitimate
  reasons for activities from unfamiliar locations, this is not a standalone indicator.
  Nevertheless, location can be a relevant piece of information that you may wish
  to investigate further.'
