name: Suspicious AWS S3 Activities
narrative: 'As cloud computing has exploded, so has the number of creative attacks
  on virtual environments. And as the number-two cloud-service provider, Amazon Web
  Services (AWS) has certainly had its share.\

  Amazon''s "shared responsibility" model dictates that the company has responsibility
  for the environment outside of the VM and the customer is responsible for the security
  inside of the S3 container. As such, it''s important to stay vigilant for activities
  that may belie suspicious behavior inside of your environment.\

  Among things to look out for are S3 access from unfamiliar locations and by unfamiliar
  users. Some of the searches in this Analytic Story help you detect suspicious behavior
  and others help you investigate more deeply, when the situation warrants.   '
