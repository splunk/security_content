description: This analytic story includes detections that help security analysts identify and investigate unusual 
  activities associated with the Gomir backdoor malware. Gomir is a sophisticated cyber threat that gains unauthorized 
  access to systems. It communicates with a remote command-and-control (C2) server to execute malicious commands, steal 
  sensitive data, and facilitate further attacks, often evading traditional security measures.
narrative: The Gomir backdoor malware is a piece of cyber threat designed to infiltrate and compromise systems covertly. 
  Once it gains unauthorized access, Gomir establishes a persistent presence by communicating with a remote command-and-control (C2) server. 
  This connection allows the attacker to execute a wide range of malicious commands on the infected system. Gomir is capable of stealing 
  sensitive data, which can be exfiltrated back to the attacker. Additionally, Gomir can download and install further malicious payloads, 
  facilitating broader cyber-espionage or destructive activities.
