description: Quickly identify systems running new or unusual processes in your environment
  that could be indicators of suspicious activity. Processes run from unusual locations,
  those with conspicuously long command lines, and rare executables are all examples
  of activities that may warrant deeper investigation.

name: Unusual Processes
narrative: 'Being able to profile a host''s processes within your environment can
  help you more quickly identify processes that seem out of place when compared to
  the rest of the population of hosts or asset types.\

  This Analytic Story lets you identify processes that are either a) not typically
  seen running or b) have some sort of suspicious command-line arguments associated
  with them. This Analytic Story will also help you identify the user running these
  processes and the associated process activity on the host.\

  In the event an unusual process is identified, it is imperative to better understand
  how that process was able to execute on the host, when it first executed, and whether
  other hosts are affected. This extra information may provide clues that can help
  the analyst further investigate any suspicious activity.'
