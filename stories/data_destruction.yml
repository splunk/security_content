description: Leverage searches that allow you to detect and investigate unusual activities that might relate to the data destruction, 
  including deleting files, overwriting files, wiping disk and unrecoverable file encryption. This analytic story may cover several 
  known activities related to malware implants used in geo-political war to wipe disks or files to interrupt the network-wide operation 
  of a targeted organization. Analytics can detect the behavior of "DoubleZero Destructor", "CaddyWiper", "AcidRain", "AwfulShred", 
  "Hermetic Wiper", "Swift Slicer", "Whisper Gate" and many more.
narrative: Adversaries may partially or completely overwrite the contents of a storage device rendering the data irrecoverable through 
  the storage interface or using 3rd party drivers to directly access disk content like Master Boot Record to wipe it. 
  Some of these attacks were seen in geo-political war to impair the operation of targeted organizations or to interrupt network-wide services.
