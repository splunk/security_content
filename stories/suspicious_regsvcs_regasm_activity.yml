name: Suspicious Regsvcs Regasm Activity
narrative: ' Adversaries may abuse Regsvcs and Regasm to proxy execution of code through
  a trusted Windows utility. Regsvcs and Regasm are Windows command-line utilities
  that are used to register .NET Component Object Model (COM) assemblies. Both are
  digitally signed by Microsoft. The following queries assist with detecting suspicious
  and malicious usage of Regasm.exe and Regsvcs.exe. Upon reviewing usage of Regasm.exe
  Regsvcs.exe, review file modification events for possible script code written. Review
  parallel process events for csc.exe being utilized to compile script code.'
