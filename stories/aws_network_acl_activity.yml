narrative: AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance,
  and operational/risk auditing of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role,
  or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. It is crucial for a company
  to monitor events and actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line
  Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs to ensure that your servers are not vulnerable
  to attacks. This analytic story contains detection searches that leverage CloudTrail
  logs from AWS to check for bad configurations and malicious activity in your AWS
  network access controls.
