description: Adversaries may use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting/hooking and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information.
narrative: Rootkits or rootkit enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system or lower, to include a hypervisor, Master Boot Record, or System Firmware. Rootkits have been seen for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.
  Linux rootkits may not standout as much as a Windows rootkit, therefore understanding what kernel modules are installed today and monitoring for new is important. As with any rootkit, it may blend in using a common kernel name or variation of legitimate names.
