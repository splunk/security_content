narrative: "A common adversary goal is to identify and exfiltrate data of value from\
  \ a target organization. This data may include email conversations and addresses,\
  \ confidential company information, links to network design/infrastructure, important\
  \ dates, and so on.\\\n Attacks are composed of three activities: identification,\
  \ collection, and staging data for exfiltration. Identification typically involves\
  \ scanning systems and observing user activity. Collection can involve the transfer\
  \ of large amounts of data from various repositories. Staging/preparation includes\
  \ moving data to a central location and compressing (and optionally encoding and/or\
  \ encrypting) it. All of these activities provide opportunities for defenders to\
  \ identify their presence. \\\nUse the searches to detect and monitor suspicious\
  \ behavior related to these activities."
