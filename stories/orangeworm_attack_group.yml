id: bb9f5ed2-916e-4364-bb6d-97c370efcf52
name: Orangeworm Attack Group
narrative: 'In May of 2018, the attack group Orangeworm was implicated for installing
  a custom backdoor called Trojan.Kwampirs within large international healthcare corporations
  in the United States, Europe, and Asia. This malware provides the attackers with
  remote access to the target system, decrypting and extracting a copy of its main
  DLL payload from its resource section. Before writing the payload to disk, it inserts
  a randomly generated string into the middle of the decrypted payload in an attempt
  to evade hash-based detections.\

  Awareness of the Orangeworm group first surfaced in January, 2015. It has conducted
  targeted attacks against related industries, as well, such as pharmaceuticals and
  healthcare IT solution providers.\

  Healthcare may be a promising target, because it is notoriously behind in technology,
  often using older operating systems and neglecting to patch computers. Even so,
  the group was able to evade detection for a full three years. Sources say that the
  malware spread quickly within the target networks, infecting computers used to control
  medical devices, such as MRI and X-ray machines.\

  This Analytic Story is designed to help you detect and investigate suspicious activities
  that may be indicative of an Orangeworm attack. One detection search looks for command-line
  arguments. Another monitors for uses of sc.exe, a non-essential Windows file that
  can manipulate Windows services. One of the investigative searches helps you get
  more information on web hosts that you suspect have been compromised.'
