description: The stealing of data by an adversary.
narrative: Exfiltration comes in many flavors.  Adversaries can collect data
  over encrypted or non-encrypted channels.  They can utilise Command and Control
  channels that are already in place to exfiltrate data.  They can use both standard
  data transfer protocols such as FTP, SCP, etc to exfiltrate data.  Or they can use
  non-standard protocols such as DNS, ICMP, etc with specially crafted fields to
  try and circumvent security technologies in place.
