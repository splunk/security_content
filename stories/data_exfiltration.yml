id: 66b0fe0c-1351-11eb-adc1-0242ac120002
name: Data Exfiltration
narrative: Exfiltration comes in many flavors.  Adversaries can collect data over
  encrypted or non-encrypted channels.  They can utilise Command and Control channels
  that are already in place to exfiltrate data.  They can use both standard data transfer
  protocols such as FTP, SCP, etc to exfiltrate data.  Or they can use non-standard
  protocols such as DNS, ICMP, etc with specially crafted fields to try and circumvent
  security technologies in place.
