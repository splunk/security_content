description: Monitor for activities and techniques associated with Discovery and Reconnaissance
  within with Active Directory environments.
narrative: 'Discovery consists of techniques an adversay uses to gain knowledge about
  an internal environment or network. These techniques provide adversaries with situational
  awareness and allows them to have the necessary information before deciding how
  to act or who/what to target next.\

  Once an attacker obtains an initial foothold in an Active Directory environment,
  she is forced to engage in Discovery techniques in the initial phases of a breach
  to better understand and navigate the target network. Some examples include but
  are not limited to enumerating domain users, domain admins, computers, domain controllers,
  network shares, group policy objects, domain trusts, etc.'
