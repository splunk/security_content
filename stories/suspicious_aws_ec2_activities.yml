name: Suspicious AWS EC2 Activities
narrative: AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance,
  and risk auditing within your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an
  AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. It is crucial for a company to
  monitor events and actions taken in the AWS Console, AWS command-line interface,
  and AWS SDKs and APIs to ensure that your EC2 instances are not vulnerable to attacks.
  This Analytic Story identifies suspicious activities in your AWS EC2 instances and
  helps you respond and investigate those activities.
