description: The following analytic story describes applications that may be abused to reverse proxy back into an organization, either for persistence or remote access. 
narrative: This analytic story covers tools like Ngrok which is a legitimate reverse proxy tool that can create a secure tunnel to servers located behind firewalls or on local machines that do not have a public IP.
  Ngrok in particular has been leveraged by threat actors in several campaigns including use for lateral movement and data exfiltration. There are many open source and closed/paid that fall into this reverse proxy category. The analytic story and complemented analytics will be released as more are identified.
