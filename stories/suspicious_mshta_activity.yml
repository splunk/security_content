description: Monitor and detect techniques used by attackers who leverage the mshta.exe
  process to execute malicious code.
narrative: 'One common adversary tactic is to bypass application allow listing solutions
  via the mshta.exe process, which executes Microsoft HTML applications with the .hta
  suffix. In these cases, attackers use the trusted Windows utility to eproxy execution
  of malicious files, whether an .hta application, javascript, or VBScript.\

  One example of a notable mshta.exe attack was the Kovter malware (https://medium.com/@mbromileyDFIR/malware-monday-aebb456356c5)
  that was implicated in ransomware and click-fraud attacks. Kovter utilized .hta
  to execute a series of javascript commands, each progressively more dangerous. According
  to the Mitre Parternship Network (https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1170),
  FIN7 has leveraged mshta.exe, as has the MuddyWater group, who used it to execute
  its POWERSTATS payload (which then used the utility to execute additional payloads).\

  The searches in this story help you detect and investigate suspicious activity that
  may indicate that an attacker is leveraging mshta.exe to execute malicious code.'
