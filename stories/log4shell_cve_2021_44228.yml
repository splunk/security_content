description: Log4Shell or CVE-2021-44228 is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability
  in the Apache Log4j library, a widely used and ubiquitous logging framework for
  Java. The vulnerability allows an attacker who can control log messages to execute
  arbitrary code loaded from attacker-controlled servers and we anticipate that most
  apps using the Log4j library will meet this condition.
narrative: 'In late November 2021, Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba identified a remote code
  execution vulnerability. Previous work was seen in a 2016 Blackhat talk by Alvaro
  Munoz and Oleksandr Mirosh called ["A Journey from JNDI/LDAP Manipulation to Remote
  Code Execution Dream Land"](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Munoz-A-Journey-From-JNDI-LDAP-Manipulation-To-RCE.pdf).
  Reported under the CVE ID : CVE-2021-44228, released to the public on December 10,
  2021. The vulnerability is exploited through improper deserialization of user input
  passed into the framework. It permits remote code execution and it can allow an
  attacker to leak sensitive data, such as environment variables, or execute malicious
  software on the target system.'
