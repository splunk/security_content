name: Brand Monitoring
narrative: 'While you can educate your users and customers about the risks and threats
  posed by typosquatting, phishing, and corporate espionage, human error is a persistent
  fact of life. Of course, your adversaries are all too aware of this reality and
  will happily leverage it for nefarious purposes whenever possible&#51;phishing with
  lookalike addresses, embedding faux command-and-control domains in malware, and
  hosting malicious content on domains that closely mimic your corporate servers.
  This is where brand monitoring comes in.\

  You can use our adaptation of `DNSTwist`, together with the support searches in
  this Analytic Story, to generate permutations of specified brands and external domains.
  Splunk can monitor email, DNS requests, and web traffic for these permutations and
  provide you with early warnings and situational awareness--powerful elements of
  an effective defense.\

  Notable events will include IP addresses, URLs, and user data. Drilling down can
  provide you with even more actionable intelligence, including likely geographic
  information, contextual searches to help you scope the problem, and investigative
  searches.'
