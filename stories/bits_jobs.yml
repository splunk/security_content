description: Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute or clean up after
  malicious payloads.
narrative: Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth,
  asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM).
  BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred
  to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting
  other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs,
  which contain a queue of one or more file operations. The interface to create and
  manage BITS jobs is accessible through PowerShell and the BITSAdmin tool. Adversaries
  may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after running malicious code.
  BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry
  modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls. BITS enabled execution may
  also enable persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime
  is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes
  or errors (including after system reboots).
