description: A proof-of-concept for CVE-2023-21716, a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Word that allows remote code execution utilizing a heap corruption in rich text files.
narrative: This analytic story covers content that will assist organizations in identifying potential RTF RCE abuse on endpoints.
  The vulnerability was assigned a 9.8 out of 10 severity score, with Microsoft addressing it in the February Patch Tuesday security updates along with a couple of workarounds. 
  Security researcher Joshua Drake last year discovered the vulnerability in Microsoft Office''s "wwlib.dll" and sent Microsoft a technical advisory containing proof-of-concept (PoC) code showing the issue is exploitable.
  A remote attacker could potentially take advantage of the issue to execute code with the same privileges as the victim that opens a malicious .RTF document.
  Delivering the malicious file to a victim can be as easy as an attachment to an email, although plenty of other methods exist.
  Microsoft warns that users don''t have to open a malicious RTF document and simply loading the file in the Preview Pane is enough for the compromise to start. (BleepingComputer, 2023)
