name: Suspicious Command-Line Executions
narrative: The ability to execute arbitrary commands via the Windows CLI is a primary
  goal for the adversary. With access to the shell, an attacker can easily run scripts
  and interact with the target system. Often, attackers may only have limited access
  to the shell or may obtain access in unusual ways. In addition, malware may execute
  and interact with the CLI in ways that would be considered unusual and inconsistent
  with typical user activity. This provides defenders with opportunities to identify
  suspicious use and investigate, as appropriate. This Analytic Story contains various
  searches to help identify this suspicious activity, as well as others to aid you
  in deeper investigation.
