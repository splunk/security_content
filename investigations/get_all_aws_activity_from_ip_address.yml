  will create a table containing the time, ARN, username, the type of user, the IP
  address, the AWS region the activity was in, the API called, and whether or not
  the API call was successful.
search: '`cloudtrail` | iplocation sourceIPAddress | search src_ip=$src_ip$ | spath
  output=user path=userIdentity.arn | spath output=awsUserName path=userIdentity.userName
  | spath output=userType path=userIdentity.type | rename sourceIPAddress as src_ip
  | table _time, user, userName, userType, src_ip, awsRegion, eventName, errorCode'
